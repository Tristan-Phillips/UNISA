o A high-level description of how system is organised and operates o Describes what system does to user o Design space conceptualised exploring nature interaction underlies user activities through lenses of different theories, modules, and frameworks o Provide working strategy and framework, general concepts and relations • Components: o Metaphors and analogies – how to understand what product is for and how to use o Concepts exposed through product – task domain objects created and manipulated, attributes, operations performed o Relationships between concepts = one object contains part of another, action to others o Mapping between concepts – User experience product as design Designer’s model: Model the designer has of how the system should work Users’ model: How the user understands how the system works System image: How the system actually works, portrayed through interface, manuals, help, etc Heuristic Evaluation: • Three stages: o Briefing session: ▪ Experts told what to do ▪ Prepared scripts useful o Evaluation period: ▪ 1-2 Hours ▪ Experts work independently ▪ At least 2 passes through interface o Debriefing ▪ Evaluators come together ▪ Discuss findings ▪ Suggest solution • Heuristic evaluation: o Visibility of system status – keep users informed o Match system and real world – Information natural and logical order o User control and freedom – Support undo and redo o Consistency and standards – Platform conventions o Error prevention – Prevent errors, confirmation options o Recognition rather than recall – Minimise user memory load o Flexibility and efficiency of use – User tailored frequent actions o Aesthetic and minimalist design – no irrelevant or unnecessary information dialogues o Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover errors – Error messages in plain language, indicate problem precisely, constructively suggest solution o Help and documentation – easy to search, focused user task, list concrete steps, not too large • Shneiderman’s 8 Golden rules: o Strive for consistency ▪ Consistent sequence of actions should be required in similar situations ▪ Identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens o Cater to universal usability ▪ Recognise needs of diverse users and design for plasticity ▪ Add features for novices – explanations, and for experts, shortcuts and faster pacing o Offer informative feedback ▪ Every user action should have system feedback o Design dialogs to yield closure ▪ Sequence of actions should be organised into groups with beginning, middle, end ▪ Informative feedback at completion of group of actions o Prevent errors ▪ Design system so users cannot make serious errors, greyed out buttons, etc o Permit easy reversal of actions ▪ Allows actions to be reversible o Support internal locus of control ▪ Experienced users strongly desire sense of control of the interface and the interface must respond to their actions o Reduce short term memory load ▪ Avoid interfaces in which users must remember information from one screen to use on another","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
