Both □ p and □ q are true in world a because both p and q are true in world b, the only world accessible from a. Thus the relation holds. (ii) Yes. For □ □ p  ◊ ( p  q) to be true in world b, either □ p has to be true in all worlds accessible from b or p  q has to be true in at least one world accessible form b. We see that worlds c and d are accessible from b and that p  q is true in world c (and world d). Thus the relation holds. (iii) No. For ◊ ◊ p to be true in world d, ◊ p has to be true in a world accessible from d. Because no world is accessible from d, this cannot be the case. Thus the relation does not hold. (iv) Yes. For ◊ □ q to be true in world b, □ q has to be true in at least one world accessible from b. Worlds c and d are accessible from b. □ q is vacuously true in world d (no world accessible from it). (□ q is also true in world c because q is true in the only world accessible from c, namely b.) Thus the relation holds. p, q p q","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
