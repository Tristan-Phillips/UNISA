Describing the organisation situation NAME: Ekurhuleni West TVET College ADDRESS AND CONTACT 49 North Street, Plantation, Boksburg Private INFORMATION: Bag X08, Boksburg 1460, (+2711) 917-9984 MISSION OR BUSINESS TheEKURHULENIWESTTVET OBJECTIVES: COLLEGE aspires to equip students with knowledgeandskillsbyoffering appropriate, quality, education and training programmes in order to empower students to readily obtain employment or become self- employed. OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: Ekurhuleni West TVET College is an accredited public institution resulting from the merger of the following former technical colleges: Alberton, Boksburg, Germiston, Kempton, Lazarus Nhlapo and Usizo Colleges. ORGANISATION LEGISLATIVE Ekurhuleni West TVET College (EWC) is a STRUCTURE: public institution regulated by the FET Colleges Act no 16 of 2006. It was established in terms of the Further Education and Training Act, Act No. 98 of 1998, declared as such by the Member of the Executive Council (MEC) for Education (Gauteng Province) in terms of a Provincial Gazette Extraordinary (dated 7 December 2001). 1.2. Defining problems and constraints • Very negative reviews from students • Lack of communication • Poor system tracking in regards to: o Viewing schedules o Viewing marks o No provision for tracking attendance o Lecturer details Page 3 of 20 Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides Downloaded by: TTEQ | tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides 1.3. Project objectives Create a system/database that provides students and lecturers the ability to easily and efficiently track and monitor student attendance to lectures, as well as managing student marks for each of their learning units or modules. 1.4. Project scope and boundaries permission Create a database design/concept that provides: • Keeping track of the attendance of each student for a lecture • The viewing of student details • The viewing of employee details • Checking if an employee is a lecturer and what course they teach • Keeping track of the course that the student is enrolled • Keeping track of the learning units or modules in each course • Keeping track of the marks for each student’s learning units • Keeping track of the attempts a student took for each mark Page 4 of 20 Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides Downloaded by: TTEQ | tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides OUTCOME 2 2.1 Source of information This assignment was based on a case study, by evaluating many student and employee reviews of the Ekurhuleni West TVET College, as well as ratings on their Facebook page. 2.2 Information collected and processed A lot of information was taken from the Ekurhuleni West TVET College website (http://www.ewc.edu.za/index.htm) as well as their Facebook page (https://web.facebook.com/EWCTVET/?_rdc=1&_rdr). Important information that was processed from the website were: • General Information • Student Statistics • Employee Statistics The most relevant information was taken from many reviews of actual students and employees (https://www.indeed.co.za/cmp/Ekurhuleni-West-College/reviews, https://www.hellopeter.com/ekurhuleni-west-college, https://www.hellopeter.com/ekurhuleni-west-college/reviews/ewc-kempton-park-campus- complaint-2135044, https://web.facebook.com/EWCTVET/?_rdc=1&_rdr). From the many reviews and complaints, I came to a conclusion that Ekurhuleni West TVET College: • Needs a attendance system that keeps track of students lecture attendance • Needs a system that students can easily track their marks • Needs a system that students and lecturers can keep track of general information 2.3 Business rules • The attendance register must contain the date, student and employee in charge of the student (lecturer). The attendance register contains many dates, students and employees. • Each student has an account holder who pays for the student’s fees • Each student can enrol in only one course • Each student course can contain many learning units • Every learning unit has a marks that comprises of an exam mark and year mark • The student mark may have more than one attempt if a student fails • An employee may be a lecturer and can specialise in a certain course Page 5 of 20 Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides Downloaded by: TTEQ | tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides OUTCOME 3 3.1. Database Design approach The approach that will be taken for the database design will be a snowflake schema. A snowflake schema represents a dimensional model which is composed of a central fact table and a set of constituent dimension tables which can be further broken up into sub-dimension tables. Reasons: • It has a Normalized Data Structure. • it uses smaller disk space • query performance is reduced Page 6 of 20 Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides Downloaded by: TTEQ | tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides 3.2.

And the COMMIT only happens when all the instructions are executed properly. • If anything fails in between the transaction, whole effect of transaction should be reverted, as if the transaction never happened. • Each transaction must display the ACID test concept which is: o Atomicity- Requires that all operations (SQL requests) of a transaction be completed o Consistency- Indicates the permanence of database’s consistent state o Isolation- Data used during execution of a transaction cannot be used by second transaction until first one is completed o Durability- Ensures that once transaction changes are done and committed, they cannot be undone or lost, even in the event of system failure. 4.2 Formulate possible SQL statements for the database • The following possible SQL statements would have been used to evaluate the transactional results. • The SQL statements where created in the form of stored procedures for the purpose of easy implementation and execution.

The goal of Database performance is to execute queries as fast as possible. • Performance Tuning: Client and Server o SQL performance tuning: Generates SQL query that returns correct answer in least amount of time o DBMS performance tuning: DBMS environment configured to respond to clients’ requests as fast as possible • DBMS Architecture o SQL cache or procedure cache: Stores most recently executed SQL statements or PL/SQL procedures o Input/output request: Low-level data access operation that reads or writes data to and from computer devices • Database Query Optimization Modes o Automatic query optimization: DBMS finds the most cost-effective access path without user intervention o Manual query optimization: Requires that the optimization be selected and scheduled by the end user or programmer o Static query optimization: best optimization strategy is selected when the query is compiled by the DBMS o Dynamic query optimization: Access strategy is dynamically determined by the DBMS at run time, using the most up-to-date information about the database 5.2 Database performance turning approach used The approach used was the SQL performance tuning Reason: Optimization is key, when querying a database. An inefficient query may pose a burden on the database, and cause slow. Hence it is important to optimize your queries for minimum impact on the database’s performance. How was it used? • By defining SELECT Fields instead of SELECT * • By selecting more fields to avoid SELECT DISTINCT • By using WHERE instead of having to Define Filters Page 17 of 20 Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides Downloaded by: TTEQ | tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Challenges encountered • The most difficult challenge was finding a real-world organisation due not only to my time limitation but the time limitation on organisations as well as due to the COVID- 19 pandemic organisations were not willing to take the risk as most employees are working from home. The solution was to base this assignment of a case study • Another challenge was finding a case study on an organisation that needed a new/improved database design. The solution was to find a poorly recognised organisation in the public’s eye, and search online for many reviews of the organisation and see what need was not being fulfilled. How can the assignment be improved? • The time limitation is too big of a factor, organisations are too busy and not welcoming to students and due to the COVID-19 pandemic it’s not a good idea to take the risk. The simplest solution is for UNISA to use the case study approach as to “real-world” organisations. • Case studies are difficult to find in that not enough information is given. The best solution is for UNISA to give a case study and students must base their assignment on that particular case study.
