Icons and animations have been used to indicate the current state of a computer or a phone, notably when it is waking up or being rebooted. • Annoying Interface: In many situations, computer interfaces may inadvertently elicit negative emotional responses such as anger and disgust. This typically happens when something that should be simple to use or set turns out to be complex. • Persuasive technology: A diversity of technologies is increasingly being used to draw people's attention to certain kinds of information in an attempt to change what they do or think. Pop- up ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, and recommendations are some of the methods that are being deployed on computer screens. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chapter 5 - Persuasive Technologies and Behavioural Change Discuss how the design of a technology can change the attitude and behaviour of people? 2. 11 - 18 Marks 2017 N 2017 P2 2017 P1 Answer: Just in time persuasion• Simulating experience• Personalizing• Recommendation• Monitoring and tracking• Competition and recognition• Visualizing the personalities in virtual communities• -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- List any five usability goals?3.

Good software design is important if you want your code to run as speedily and efficiently as possible. It also allows your code to be easily maintained and scaled in the future. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- List five design principles that are concerned with how to determine what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product according to Preece et al (2015)? 2. 5 Marks 2017 N 2017 P2 2017 P1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One of the main design principles for website design is simplicity. Nielsen proposed that designers go through all their design elements and remove them one by one. If a design works well without an element, then just remove it. Do you think this is a good design principle? Discuss.3. 5 - 6 Marks 2017 N 2017 P2 2017 P1 Answer: Simplicity is certainly an important design principle. Many designers try to cram too much into a screenful of space, making it unwieldy for people to find what they are interested in. Removing design elements to see what can be discarded without affecting the overall function of the website can be a salutary lesson. Unnecessary icons, buttons, boxes, lines, graphics, shading, and text can be stripped, leaving a cleaner, crisper, and easier-to-navigate website. However, graphics, shading, coloring, and formatting can make a site aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable to use. Plain vanilla sites with just lists of text and a few links may not be as appealing and may put certain visitors off INF3720 Page 3 sites with just lists of text and a few links may not be as appealing and may put certain visitors off returning. Good interaction design involves getting the right balance between aesthetic appeal and the optimal amount and kind of information per page. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There is a fine line between an interaction that works and an interaction that is usable. Designing interactions that work and are usable is achievable if design principles are appropriately applied. Discuss the five design principles that guide interaction design?4. 10 Marks 2018 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conceptual Model Briefly explain each of the following terms: Usability, Framework, Conceptual Model as they relate to human computer interaction 1. 6 Marks 2017 P1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Discuss the core components of a conceptual model?2. 8 Marks 2017 P1 Answer: • Metaphors and Analogies: That convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity (e.g. browsing, bookmarking). • Concepts: People are exposed to through the product, including the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, the operations that can be performed on them. • Relationship: Between those concepts (whether one object contains / is part of another, the relative importance of actions to others. • Mappings: Between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In which three ways can metaphors and analogies be applied in conceptual design? 3. 6 Marks 2017 P1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A classic early example of a conceptual framework in HCI is Norman's (1998) explication of the relationship between the design of a conceptual model and the user's understanding of it. The framework comprises three interacting components, the designer's model, user's model and the system image. INF3720 Page 4 Discuss each of the above components4. 6 Marks 2017 P2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Why is it important that designers consolidate the three components when designing software? 5. 6 Marks 2017 P2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Emotional Design What is emotional interaction and what does it entail?1. 5 Marks 2018 Emotional interaction is concerned with how we feel and react when interacting with technologies. • Emotional interaction is about considering what makes us happy, sad, annoyed, anxious, frustrated, motivated, delirious, and so on, and translating this knowledge into different aspects of the user experience, from when we first want something, to when we no longer interact with it or need to replace it. • -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Identify the three levels of Ortony et al (2005) Model of Emotional design and briefly discuss how each level of the model inform the design of a product? 2. 9 Marks 2018 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Young children who cannot read nor write have been observed to have an interest in using or playing with mobile device based application. Given their interest, it is valuable that interaction designers focus on designing applications that are usable by this group of children. In this respect, as an interaction designer, briefly describe the main interaction types that you would recommend for the design of an interactive game for young children who cannot read nor write? 3. 9 Marks 2018 Answer: INF3720 Page 5 Manipulating: Use of graphics such as button, shapes or images that kids can touch to send manipulating commands. This enables children to feel that they are directly controlling the digital objects represented on a mobile game. • Instructing: Instructions can be done in various ways such as through touch or speaking (voice) commands. • Exploring: Kids should be able to move around the interface and discover different games. They can scroll horizontally or vertically. The menus on the interface should depict games using pictures. • Conversing: Use a dialogue (voice) to play the game.• -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Data Gathering What are environmental requirements?1. 2 Marks 2018 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Briefly discuss four aspects of environment that should be considered when establishing requirements? 2. 8 Marks 2018 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- State any five aspects of user characteristics that affect the capturing of software requirements? 3. 10 Marks 2018 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- State five advantages of involving users during software development?4. 10 Marks 2018 2017 N -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Which are the five key issues that require attention for any data gathering session to become successful? 5. 10 Marks 2017 N Answer: Five key issues that require attention for data gathering are: INF3720 Page 6 Decide which data to collect, data collection techniques and the analysis to be carried○ Goal setting• The population○ The sample ○ Sampling criteria○ Identifying participants• Issues of ethics○ Professional○ Informed consent○ The relationship between data collector and the data provider• Investigating a phenomena from at least two different perspectives○ Types of triangulation: data, investigator, theories and methods○ Triangulation• Trial run of the main study ○ Pilot studies• Five key issues that require attention for data gathering are: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What should be avoided when designing interview questions?6. 5 Marks 2017 N Answer: The questions should not be ambiguous• Avoid emotional language• Jargon or complex language should be avoided• Avoid leading questions• Avoid bias• Avoid questions that require a response of a simple yes or no answer. • An interview is a conversation with the purpose of capturing data. The following should be avoided when designing interview questions: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Several e-readers for reading e-books, watching movies or viewing pictures are available on the market. The exact design differs between models but they support book reading that is intended to be as comfortable as reading a paper book. The developers of a new e-reader want to find out how appealing it will be to young people under the age of 18. To this end, they have asked you to conduct some interviews for them. You are required to answer the following questions in preparation for the interview: What is the goal of your data gathering session?7. 2 Marks 2017 P2 2017 P1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the interview?8. 3 - 6 Marks 2017 P2 2017 P1 INF3720 Page 7 2017 P1 Answer: • One on One Interviews • Group Interviews • Questionnaires -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Discuss any three disadvantages of taking notes during an interview?9. 2 - 6 Marks 2017 P2 2017 P1 Answer: • It breaks eye contact way too often. • It shifts your attention away from the person, diminishing his or her sense of importance. • Trying to record everything a person says may cause you to ask them to slow down, or the person may slow their tempo & natural expression is lost. • It impedes your observation of the clients non-verbal behaviour. • It is threatening to the client during the discussion of sensitive issues -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals? 10. 3 - 6 Marks 2017 P2 2017 P1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Focus on users and tasks early When following a user-centred approach in interaction design, there is a principle of 'focus on users and tasks early'. This is one of the principles that make it easy and useful to use a computer system. Name and explain five sub-principles that explain the meaning of the above statement? 1. 10 Marks 2017 P2 2017 P1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- How would you apply the five sub-principles in improving the myUnisa system? 2. 10 Marks 2017 P1 INF3720 Page 8 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Heuristic Evaluation Heuristic evaluation is an informal usability inspection technique developed by Nielson and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure or online help can conform to the principles. Discuss heuristic evaluation under the following headings Briefly discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation?1. 6 Marks 2018 2017 N 2017 P2 2017 P1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Schneiderman's eight golden rules are used as heuristics for identifying usability problems, discuss the four selected rules: 2. Cater for universal usability (3)• Permit easy reversal of actions (3)• Support internal locus (3)• Design dialogues to yield closure (3)• 12 - 18 Marks 2018 2017 N 2017 P2 (3 rules, 6 marks each) 2017 P1 (3 rules, 3 marks each) Answer: • Cater for universal usability: Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Novice to expert differences, age ranges, disabilities, and technological diversity each enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices, such as explanations, and features for experts, such as shortcuts and faster pacing, can enrich the interface design and improve perceived system quality. • Permit easy reversal of actions: As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data-entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name-address block. • Support internal locus of Control: Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions. They don't want surprises or changes in familiar behaviour, and they are annoyed by tedious data entry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary information, and inability to produce their desired result. • Design dialogues to yield closure: Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to prepare for the next group of actions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cognitive Walkthroughs INF3720 Page 9 Cognitive Walkthroughs According to Nielsen and Mack (1994), cognitive walkthroughs involve simulating a user's problem- solving process at each step in the human computer dialog, checking to see if the user's goals and memory for actions can be assumed to lead to the next correct action. Discuss each of the five steps involved in cognitive walkthroughs?1. 10 Marks 2017 N Answer: ○ ID characteristics of typical users ○ Develop sample tasks ○ Produce description or prototype of interface ○ Produce clear sequence of the action needed 1. Preparation: ○ Designer and one / or more expert evaluators come together to do analysis 2. Analysis: ▪ Will the correct action be sufficiently evident to the user? ▪ Will the user notice that the correct action is available? ▪ Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly? ○ Evaluators walk through the action sequence for each task and answers questions 3. Walkthrough ○ Assumptions about what would cause problems and why ○ Notes about side issues and design changes ○ Summary of results 4. Record: ○ Design revised to fix the problems 5.
