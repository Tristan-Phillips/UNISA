[TURN OVER] 2 Question 1 Consider the UML class diagrams and code fragment below Register Output - QStnng register + Register() + Output() + setReg1ster(QStnng) + outputReg1ster(QStnng) int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { Register *r = new Register(); Output *o = new Output(), r->setReg1ster(\"2015/04~), deleter; delete o, return O, COS3711 October/November 2015 [12 marks] 1 1 Wnte code for the two class def1mt1ons and the setRegister {QString) function so that when a register value 1n the Register class 1s set, its value 1s automatically displayed using the outputRegister (QString) function. Add any code that may be required to the main () function. You are not required to include any pre-processor directives (7) 1 2 Wnte a regular expression that can be used to validate the register value. This value should have the format yyyy/mm where • yyyy 1s between 2000 and 2015; • the separator character could be any of forward slash (/), dash (-), or dot ( ), and • the month should be between 01 and 12 Note that you only have to wnte the regular expression that will be used, and you do not have to 1nd1cate how 1t will be used. (5) Question 2 Examine the classes below where circle should be a type of Shape class Shape { Q_PROPERTY(int length READ getLength WRITE setLength) public Shape(); Shape ( int len) ; QString t0Str1ng() canst, private int l engt h, } ; [19 marks] [TURN OVER] class Circle { public }. Circle(); Circle(int radius), QString t0Str1ng() canst; double getCircumference() canst, 3 COS3711 October/November 2015 2 1 We require the two classes above to support reflection, and that when the following code 1s run, 1t 1s the circle's data that 1s displayed Shape *shape= new Circle(); qDebug() << shape->toString(), Rewrite the two class def1mt1ons so that these requirements can be met No pre- processor d1rect1ves are required (6) 2 2 Consider the following Shape *shapel = new Shape(l), Shape *shape2 = new Circle(2); qDebug() << \"I am a\"<< whatAmI(shapel), // \"I am a Shape\" qDebug(} << \"! am a \" << whatAmI(shape2), // \"I am a Circle\" Assuming that all the classes above support reflection, wnte the code for the whatAmI () function. (5) 2 3 Is the following code legal? If so, explain why 1t works, and what its effect 1s; 1f not, explain why (3) Shape *shape= new Shape(), shape->setProperty(\"length\", 5), 2 4 Is the following code legal? If so, explain why 1t works, and what its effect 1s, 1f not, explain why. (3) Shape *shape= new Circle(), shape->setProperty (\"colour\", \"blue\"), 2 5 What do you understand by the term \"meta-obJect\", and what 1s its maJor benefit? (2) Question 3 [9 marks] The following code fragment should implement a model-view approach to managing and viewing data 1 QStringListModel *model= new QStringListModel() , 2 II use an appropriate view class 3 // link the model and view 4. QString data(\"Data to be added\") , 5 int row= model->ro wCount(), 6 model->insertRow(row) , 7. QModelindex index= //find the required index 8. // update the model 9 c onnec t(m ode l, S IGNAL(/*signal emitted when model is changed*/), th is , SLOT(updateModel())), [TURN OVER] 4 COS3711 October/November 2015 3.1 Complete the code by replacing the comments with the necessary statements You need only wnte down the hne numbers and the replaced code (6) 3 2 What does QModelindex represent m the code above? (1) 3 3 How would QListWidget, a convenience class, differ from QStringListModel 1n terms of a model-view approach?

(7) 4.2 The Factory Method design pattern decouples the chent from the concrete subclasses of the class hierarchy. Explain two benefits of this decoupling between the client and the concrete subclasses of the class hierarchy (4) [TURN OVER} 5 COS3711 October/November 2015 Question 5 [7 marks] Consider the partial definition of the class solo that implements the Singleton design pattern class Solo { public : stati c Solo* instance( ) ; private. Solo() ; static Solo* onelnstance; } , 5.1 Write one hne of code to demonstrate how chent code can access the only instance of Solo (1) 5.2 The following lines of code that use solo do not compile. Why? (2) Solo sl; //line 1 Solo *s2 = al . inst a nce{); //line 2 5.3 Why 1s the pointer (oneinstance) to the only instance of Solo static? (2) 5.4 What 1s the effect of adding a destructor in solo, which has the statement delete one Instance, in its implementation? (2) Question 6 (12 marks] 6 1 The following questions are about the Fa9ade design pattern. 6.1 1 Into which of the three general categories of design patterns does Fac;ade fall? (1) 6.1.2 Give a real-world example of an 1mplementat1on of the Fac;ade design pattern. Motivate your answer (2) 6 2 The following questions are about the Memento design pattern 6.2.1 Both Serializer and Memento design patterns save states of obJects and can be used to provide a roll-back facility When would you use Memento instead of Senahzer? (2) 6.2 2 What objects does Caretaker hold? (1) 6 2.3 Why 1s Originator a friend of Memento? (2) 6 2.4 Assume that a state of Originator 1s saved at some stage using the Memento design pattern.
