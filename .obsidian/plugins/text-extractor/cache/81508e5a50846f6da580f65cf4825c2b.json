Voicemail system 2. Remote control A key question for interaction design is how do you optimize the user’s interactions with a system, environment, or product. One way is to make choices based on an understanding of the users. This would include:  Taking into account what people are good and bad at  Considering what might help people with the way they currently do things  Thinking through what might provide quality user experiences  Listening to what people want and getting them involved in the design  Using ‘tried and tested’ user-based techniques during the design process What is Interaction Design? Interaction design means… Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday working lives Interaction design uses several different components including some of the following academic disciplines… Page | 2 It also implements the following Design Practices… Page | 3 Is Interaction Design beyond HCI? The main difference between ID and HCI is one of scope. ID has a much wider net in terms of theory, research, and practice of designing user experiences. HCI has a much narrower focus being concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems. The process of Interaction Design The process involves four basic activities… 1. Identifying needs and establishing requirements for the user experience 2. Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements 3. Building interactive versions of the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed 4. Evaluating what is being built throughout the process and the user experience it offers Interaction Design and the User Experience 6 Usability Goals  Effective to use (effectiveness) – how good is a product at doing what it is supposed to do  Efficient to use (efficiency) – once a user has learned how to use a product, can they sustain a high level of productivity  Safe to use (safety) – protecting a user from dangerous conditions and undesirable situations  Having good utility (utility) – Does it allow the user to carry out all their tasks in the way they would want to do them  Easy to learn (learnability) – Can the user work out how to use the product easily  Easy to remember how to use (memorability) – How easy is it for the user to remember how to use the product Positive User Experience Goals  Satisfying  Enjoyable  Engaging  Pleasurable  Exciting  Entertaining  etc. 5 Design Principles  Visibility – The more visible functions are, the more likely users are to use them  Feedback – Send feedback when an action is performed Page | 4  Constraints – restricting the kinds of user interaction that can be performed at a given moment – i.e. deactivating menu buttons  Consistency – Interfaces that have similar operations look similar  Affordance – Indicates to a user how to use the operation – i.e. a dial that one turns to wind up a clock Aims of this chapter 2  Explain what is meant by the problem space  Explain how to conceptualize interaction  Describe what a conceptual model is and how to begin to formulate one  Discuss the pros and cons of using interface metaphors as part of a conceptual model  Outline the core interaction types for informing the development of a conceptual model  Introduce theories, models, and frameworks as a way of informing interaction design Summary Understanding the problem space Problem space - Understand and conceptualize what is currently the user experience/product and how this is going to be improved or changed. Different people have different perspectives, defining a problem space is usually best done by a group of different individuals. Questions to ask…  Are there problems with an existing product or user experience?  Why do you think there are problems?  How do you think your proposed design ideas might overcome these?  If you have not identified any problems and instead are designing for a new user experience how do you think your proposed design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of doing things? Conceptualizing the design space A conceptual model is a high level description of how a system is organized and operates. The most important thing to design is the user’s conceptual model. Everything else should be subordinated to making that model clear, obvious, and substantial. That is almost exactly opposite to how most software is designed. A conceptual model is an abstraction that outlines what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Some things that a conceptual model could comprise of would include… Page | 5  The major metaphors and analogies that are used to convey to the user how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity.  The concepts that users are exposed to through the product, including the task domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them.  The relationship between those concepts  The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke The benefits of conceptualizing a design in general terms early on in the design process encourages design teams to…  Orient themselves towards asking specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the targeted users  Not to become narrowly focussed early on  To establish a set of common terms they all understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on Interface metaphors and analogies An interface metaphor is considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. Interface metaphors are often composites – i.e. they combine quite different pieces of familiar knowledge with the system functionality – i.e. Desktop or Scrollbar or Toolbar Opposition to using interface metaphors A mistake often made is to make an interface metaphor behave/look exactly the same way as the real life object. Example of this would be implementing a computer calculator exactly the same way a real calculator is implemented – which would not make sense as the real calculator has constraints such as size and cost that a computer calculator would not have that effects the user experience (size and number of buttons). Some reasons for opposition to using interface metaphors include…  Breaking the rules – i.e. recycle on the desktop whereas in real life it would be under the desktop  Too constraining – selecting a file form a list instead of searching for it  Conflicts with design principles  Not being able to understand the system functionality beyond the metaphor  Overly literal translation of existing bad designs  Limits the designers imagination in conjuring up new paradigms and models Interaction types Four fundamental types of interaction someone can have with a product/system 1. Instructing – i.e. typing commands on a console 2. Conversing – i.e. menu driven phone systems Page | 6 3. Manipulating – i.e. physical objects with rfid’s that a computer monitors the manipulation of 4. Exploring – virtual 3d worlds i.e. sim city? There are many other ways, however the four cover the main types. Theories, Models, and Frameworks Theories – numerous theories have been imported into human computer interaction, providing a means of analysing and predicting the performance of systems. Models – Models are typically abstracted from a theory coming from a contributing discipline Frameworks – a number of frameworks have been introduced in ID to help designers constrain and scope the user experience. Frameworks have traditionally been based on theories of human behaviour, but they are increasingly being developed from the experience of actual design practice and the findings arising from user studies. Aims if this chapter 4  Explain what is meant by communication and collaboration  Describe the social mechanisms that are used by people to communicate and collaborate  Outline the range of collaborative systems that have been developed to support this kind of social behaviour  Describe some of the new forms of social behaviour that have emerged as a result of the proliferation of mobile devices, web-based services, and applications Summary Social mechanisms in communication and collaboration Underlying the various forms of communication are mechanisms and practices that have evolved to enable us to maintain social order. Three core forms of social mechanisms that are used… 1. The use of conversational mechanisms to facilitate the flow of talk and help overcome conversational breakdowns 2. The use of coordination mechanisms to allow people to work and interact together 3. The use of awareness mechanisms to find out what is happening, what others are doing, and conversely to let others know what is happening Three basic rules for conversational analysis… 1. The current speaker chooses the next speaker by asking an opinion, question, or request 2. Another person decides to start speaking 3. The current speaker continues talking Page | 7 Kinds of Conversations  Informal  Formal Designing collaborative technologies to support conversation A central concern is to allow people to communicate collaboratively when they are not physically co-located. Communicating in physically different locations can be achieved with a variety of communication medium including...  Email  Videoconferencing  Videophones  Chat rooms  Online MUDS (multi user role playing environments)  MOOS (text based environments that grew out of MUDS) Communicating in co-located settings with a number of shareable interfaces including…  Smart boards  Digital Table tops Coordination Mechanisms To help us we use a number of coordinating mechanism including…  verbal and non-verbal communication  schedules, rules, and conventions  shared external representations People adapt the social protocols used in face-to-face collaboration when using collaborative technologies Cell phones, web based social and community services have brought about significant changes in the way people keep in touch Aims of this chapter 5  Explain what expressive interfaces are and the effects they can have on people  Outline the nature of user frustration and how to reduce it  Describe how technologies can be designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviour  Debate the pro’s and con’s of applying anthropomorphism in interaction design  Describe the affective aspects used in interface agents and interactive physical toys  Present models and frameworks of affect that can be applied to interaction design Page | 8  Enable you to critique the persuasive impact of an online agent on customers Summary What are affective aspects? The main focus is on how interactive systems can be designed to provoke an emotion within the user. Expressive interfaces and positive emotions can be used in an interface to  Convey emotional states  Elicit certain kinds of emotional responses in users One benefit of using expressive embellishments is that they provide reassuring feedback to the user that can be both informative and fun. They can also sometimes have the opposite effect. The style of an interface in terms of the shapes, font, colours, balance, white space can also have an impact on the interfaces affectiveness. Rule of thumb is that the better an interface is designed, the more tolerant the user will be if things do not work properly. Frustrating Interfaces and Negative Emotions Things that can cause frustration include  When an application doesn’t work properly or crashes  When a system doesn’t do what the user wants it to do  When a user’s expectations are not met  When a system does not provide sufficient information to let the user know what to do  When error messages pop up that are vague or obtuse  When the appearance of an interface is too noisy, garish, or patronizing  When a system requires you to carry out to many steps to accomplish a task Often user frustration is a result of bad design, no design, inadvertent design, or ill- thought-out design. Some things to keep in mind  Avoid gimmicks  Avoid non descriptive error messages  Avoid making the user wait unnecessarily  Avoid complicated upgrade processes  Avoid cluttered design and extreme us of graphics / colours Anthropomorphism in Interaction Design Anthropomorphism is the propensity people have to attribute human qualities to objects Page | 9 People have a tendency of attributing human qualities to objects and animals such as pets, toys, etc This is becoming more common in interaction design. Examples would include cuddly toys that respond to their environment, helping agents that have human like qualities, etc.. There are people who are for and against the concept. Some of the reasons for people against the concept include…  Can lead people into a false sense of belief  Can be deceptive Interface agents, virtual pets, and interactive toys Examples include Tamagutchi pets, The Woogles, etc. A lot of work has been put into designing interactive toys etc. including…  Recognizing and responding to verbal and non-verbal input  Generating verbal and non-verbal output  Coping with breakdowns, turn-taking, and other conversational mechanisms  Giving signals that indicate the state of the conversations as well as contributing new suggestions for the dialog Models of affective aspects Emotional design model Pleasure Design Model Proposes four conceptually distinct types of pleasure Page | 10  Physio-pleasure – Feels nice to touch  Socio-pleasure – Fun to have family participate with it together  Psycho-pleasure – Satisfying to use  Ideo-pleasure (cognitive) – Makes sense to use, i.e. Eco-friendly car Technology as a Framework Four core threads that make up our holistic experiences 1. The sensual thread – how absorbed we get while using the device, i.e. computer game that we find addictive 2. The emotional thread – does it invoke emotions such as happiness, sadness, etc 3. The compositional thread – does it have a narrative path, well thought out path 4. The spatio-temporal thread – how does it effect our space and time These aspects are there to help designers think of the different threads and the experience they will invoke. Aims of this chapter 7  Discuss how to plan and run a successful data gathering program  Enable you to plan and run an interview  Enable you to design a simple questionnaire  Enable you to plan and execute an observation Summary Four Key Issues 1. Setting Goals – outline what the objective of the exercise is 2. The relationship with participants – get participants to give permission to have their data used if necessary 3. Triangulation – Use more than one data gathering technique to tackle a goal 4. Pilot Studies – Run a pilot study before doing the main study to iron out bugs, do not use the same people in the pilot study in the main study as they now have an expectation Data Recording Various methods and tools to use to assist in recording data including…  Notes plus camera  Audio plus camera  Video Interviews  Unstructured Interviews – Open ended conversational Page | 11  Structured Interviews – Predetermined questions are asked with available answers i.e. which of the following best describes…  Semi-Structured Interviews – Combination of Unstructured and Semi-Structured  Focus Groups – Facilitator with group members Planning and conducting an interview Involves developing the set of questions or topics to be covered. Developing interview questions requires determining if the questions will be open or closed. The following are suggestions…  Compound sentences can be confusing, so split them into two separate questions  Interviewers may not understand jargon or complex language  Try and keep questions neutral Running an interview  Have an introduction – interviewer introduces himself  Warm-up session – easy non-threatening questions  Main session – questions presented in logical order  Cool off period – few easy questions  Closing session – end the interview Questionnaires Designing questionnaires with structure include…  Think about ordering of questions. Impact can be effected by order  Consider whether you need different versions of questionnaires for different populations  Provide clear instructions on how to complete the questionnaire  Find a balance between keeping whitespace and the questionnaire compact Question and response format…  Checkboxes and ranges  Rating scales Administering questionnaires… 2 Important issues when administering questionnaires… 1. Make sure you reach a representative sample of the audience 2. Make sure you get a reasonable response rate Observation Direct observation in the field Structuring frameworks for observation in the field Page | 12  The person  The place  The thing Degree of Participation Depends on the type of study. You can get different types of observers including  Passive Observer – does not take part, merely observers  Participant Observer – participates and interacts with those being observed Ethnography Is a qualitative method aimed to learn and understand cultural phenomena which reflect the knowledge and system of meanings guiding the life of a cultural group. See wiki for more info Choosing and combining techniques Direct observation in controlled environments This usually occurs in a usability laboratory. Same basic data recording techniques are used. The think aloud technique In a controlled environment the interviewer can afford to be more intrusive. One way is to say what they are thinking as it is happening. Indirect observation  Diaries  Interaction Logs Aims of this chapter 10  Describe different kinds of requirements  Enable you to identify examples of different kinds of requirements from a simple description  Explain how different data gathering techniques may be used during the requirements activity  Enable you to develop a scenario, a use case, and an essential use case from a simple description  Enable you to perform hierarchical task analysis on a simple description Page | 13 Summary What, How and Why The process works in a cycle.. Why bother? The importance of getting it right…  A large number of IT projects fail due to bad implementations or incorrect specifications.  It is cheaper to analyse than to develop  If you identify the needs initially substantial savings in costs What are requirements? Two types of requirements typically identified  Functional Requirements – the core problem it aims to solve. What a product should do.  Non-functional requirements – size, speed… Other types of requirements include…  Data requirements  Environmental requirements  User characteristics  Usability goals and user experience goals Data gathering for requirements The main purpose of data gathering for requirements is to collect sufficient relevant, and appropriate data so that a set of stable requirements can be produced./ Page | 14 3 common forms of data gathering include 1. Interviews 2. Questionnaires 3. Observation Interviews include…  Structured Interviews  Semi Structured Interviews  Unstructured Interviews  Focus Groups Observation include…  Direct observation  Indirect Observation  Studying documentation  Researching similar products Contextual Inquiry Contextual inquiry is one of seven parts of contextual design, which is a structured approach to the collection and interpretation of data from fieldwork with the intention of building a software-based product. Contextual inquiry rests on four main principles 1. Context – go to the workplace and see what is happening 2. Partnership – developer and user should collaborate in understanding the work 3. Interpretation – observations must be interpreted in order to be used in design 4. Focus – Keep the data gathering focussed on your goals Data gathering guidelines for requirements  Focus on identifying stakeholders needs  Involve all the stakeholder groups  Support the data gathering sessions with suitable props Data analysis, interpretation, and presentation The aim here is to structure and record descriptions of requirements. Various methods to diagram these at different levels including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, Entity Relationship Diagrams Task Description Descriptions of business tasks have been used within software development for many years. There are many different flavours of task descriptions including the following… Page | 15  Scenarios – informal narrative description that allows exploration and discussion of contexts, needs, and requirements emphasizing the context  Use cases – focus on user goals, but emphasis is on a user-system interaction. A use case has one or more actors, goals and normal course (outcome desirable). Generally described graphically  Essential Use Cases – represent abstractions from scenarios and tries to avoid the assumptions of a traditional use case An essential use case is a structured narrative consisting of three parts: 1. Name that expresses the overall intention 2. A stepped description of user actions 3. A stepped description of system responsibility Task Analysis Main purpose is to investigate an existing situation, not to envision new products. Used to analyse the underlying rationale and purpose of what people are doing and what they are trying to achieve. Hierarchical Task Analysis Involves breaking a task down into subtasks and then into sub-subtasks. The starting point is the user goal, this is then examined and the main tasks associated with achieving that goal are identified. Where appropriate these tasks are subdivided into subtasks. Aims of this Chapter 15  Consider what doing interaction design involves  Explain some advantages of involving users in development  Explain the main principles of a user-centred approach  Ask and provide answers for some important questions about the interaction design process  Introduce the idea of a lifecycle model to represent a set of activities and how they are related  Describe some lifecycle models from software engineering and HCI and discuss how they relate to the process of ID  Present a lifecycle model of interaction design Summary What is involved in interaction design Design involves working on requirements, designing a solution, producing the solution and evaluating it. Design is about trade offs – cost vs. effectiveness etc. and so key to design is generating alternatives. Page | 16 Involving users and others in design process means that the designs and potential solutions need to be communicated to people other than the original designer. There are many ways of doing this. The importance of involving users The best way to make sure that development continues to take users activities into account is to involve real users throughout the development. In this way developers can better understand user goals leading to a more appropriate more usable product. It also assists in setting expectations of the user. Expectation management is the process of making sure that the users view and expectations of the new product are realistic. It is better to exceed user expectations than to fall below them. There are several ways to set user expectations including  Involving them throughout the design and developing stages  Have timely training Degrees of user involvement User involvement depends on what is involved and the nature of the product, on one end of the scale you can have the user involved all the time on the other end of the scale you could keep them informed via newsletters How actively users should be involved is a matter of debate, too much user involvement can lead to issues and not enough user involvement can lead to poor solutions. What is a user centred approach Three principles that lead to a user centred approach  Early focus on users and tasks – see goals below  Empirical measurement – be able to measure what you are wanting to achieve  Iterative design – perform design in small steps With an early focus on users and tasks it can be further broken down into categories  User tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development  User’s behaviour and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them  User characteristics are captured and designed for  Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account  All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment Four Basic activities of Interaction Design 1. Identifying needs and establishing requirements for the user experience Page | 17 2. Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements 3. Building interactive versions of the designs 4. Evaluating what is being built throughout the process and the user experience it offers Some practical issues that need to be considered  Who are users?  What do we mean by needs?  How do you generate alternative designs?  How do you choose among alternatives? Lifecycle models: showing how the activities are related Some software engineering lifecycle models  The waterfall lifecycle model  The spiral lifecycle model  Rapid applications Development  Agile development Lifecycle models in HCI  The star lifecycle model  The usability engineering lifecycle  Human centred design process for interactive systems Star Lifecycle Model Page | 18  Does not specify any ordering of activities  Activities are highly interconnected  Evaluation is central to this model – whenever an activity is complete it must be evaluated Usability Engineering Lifecycle Essentially has 3 tasks 1. Requirements Analysis 2. Design / Testing / Development 3. Installation ISO 13407 Human-centred design processes for interactive systems International standard for providing guidance on human centred design activities. Standard identifies four principles of human centred design 1. Active involvement of users and clear understanding of user and task requirements 2. An appropriate allocation of function between users and technology 3. The iteration of design solutions 4. Multi-disciplinary design Page | 19 It specifies four human-centred design activities as being central to a system development project: 1. To understand and specify the context of use 2. To specify the user and organizational requirements 3. To produce design solutions 4. To evaluate designs against requirements","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
