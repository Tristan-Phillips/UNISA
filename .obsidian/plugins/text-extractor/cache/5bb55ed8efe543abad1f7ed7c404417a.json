Each process Pi, i = 0,1,2,3,……,9 is coded as follows. repeat P(mutex) {Critical Section} V(mutex) forever The code for P10 is identical except that it uses V(mutex) instead of P(mutex). What is the largest number of processes that can be inside the critical section at any moment (the mutex being initialized to 1)? a) 1 b) 2 c) 3 d) None of the mentioned View Answer Answer: c Explanation: Any one of the 9 processes can get into critical section after executing P(mutex) which decrements the mutex value to 0. At this time P10 can enter critical section by incrementing the value to 1. Now any of the 9 processes can enter the critical section by again decrementing the mutex value to 0. None of the remaining processes can get into their critical sections. 13. Two processes, P1 and P2, need to access a critical section of code. Consider the following synchronization construct used by the processes.

Operating System Questions and Answers – Semaphores – 2 This set of Operating System Interview Questions and Answers for freshers focuses on “Semaphores – 2” and will also be useful for interview preparations for freshers. 1. What will happen if a non-recursive mutex is locked more than once? a) Starvation b) Deadlock c) Aging d) Signaling View Answer Answer: b Explanation: If a thread which had already locked a mutex, tries to lock the mutex again, it will enter into the waiting list of that mutex, which results in a deadlock.

Process A int Y; A1: Y = X*2; A2: X = Y; Process B int Z; B1: Z = X+1; B2: X = Z; X is set to 5 before either process begins execution. As usual, statements within a process are executed sequentially, but statements in process A may execute in any order with respect to statements in process B. How many different values of X are possible after both processes finish executing? a) two b) three c) four d) eight View Answer Answer: c Explanation: Here are the possible ways in which statements from A and B can be interleaved. A1 A2 B1 B2: X = 11 A1 B1 A2 B2: X = 6 A1 B1 B2 A2: X = 10 B1 A1 B2 A2: X = 10 B1 A1 A2 B2: X = 6 B1 B2 A1 A2: X = 12. 8. The program follows to use a shared binary semaphore T. Process A int Y; A1: Y = X*2; A2: X = Y; signal(T); Process B int Z; B1: wait(T); B2: Z = X+1; X = Z; T is set to 0 before either process begins execution and, as before, X is set to 5. Now, how many different values of X are possible after both processes finish executing? a) one b) two c) three d) four View Answer Answer: a Explanation: The semaphore T ensures that all the statements from A finish execution before B begins.
