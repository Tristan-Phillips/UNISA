The system froze twice while | was trying to submit the exam and | was thrown out of myUnisa. | sent an email later when | saw that both mock exams were in fact published, but that did not seem to go through. So, | will open tonight's test from 16h00 till 21h00. You can start anytime during that time slot but you will still only get 35 minutes from the time you start. That should give all students that could not do it this morning to do it if they wish. Make sure that you then start at the latest 20h25 because it will close at 21h00 whether you could finish or not. For students using cellphones that cannot see the assessment tab. Go to the calendar for today's date and click on due. That should take you to the test. & v Reply","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
