C: Hi A: All right? C: Good, how’s it going? A: Fine, how are you? C: OK B: So-so. How’s life treating you? www.id-book.com Conversational rules • Sacks et al. (1978) conversation analysis of conversations propose three basic rules: Rule 1: the current speaker chooses the next speaker by asking an opinion, question, or request Rule 2: another person decides to start speaking Rule 3: the current speaker continues talking www.id-book.com Conversational rules • Turn-taking used to coordinate conversation – A: Shall we meet at 8? – B: Um, can we meet a bit later? – A: Shall we meet at 8? – B: Wow, look at him? – A: Yes what a funny hairdo! – B: Um, can we meet a bit later? • Back channelling to signal to continue and following – Uh-uh, umm, ahh www.id-book.com More conversational rules • Farewell rituals – Bye then, see you, yeah bye, see you later…. • Implicit and explicit cues – e.g. looking at watch, fidgeting with coat and bags – explicitly saying “Oh dear, must go, look at the time, I’m late…” www.id-book.com Breakdowns in conversation • When someone says something that is misunderstood: – Speaker will repeat with emphasis: A: “this one?” B: “no, I meant that one!” – Also use tokens: Eh? Quoi? Huh? What? www.id-book.com What happens in online conversations? • Do the same conversational rules apply? • Are there different kinds of breakdowns? • How do people repair them for: – email? – Instant messaging? – texting? – Skype or other videoconference? www.id-book.com Remote conversations • Much research on how to support conversations when people are ‘at a distance’ from each other • Many applications have been developed – e.g., email, videoconferencing, instant messaging, chatrooms • Do they mimic or move beyond existing ways of conversing? www.id-book.com Early videophone from the 60s www.id-book.com VideoWindow system (Bellcore, 1989) • Shared space that allowed people 50 miles apart to carry on a conversation as if in same room drinking coffee together • 3 x 8 ft ‘picture-window’ between two sites with video and audio • People did interact via the window but strange things happened (Kraut, 1990) www.id-book.com Diagram of VideoWindow in use www.id-book.com Findings of how VideoWindow System was used • Talked constantly about the system • Spoke more to other people in the same room rather than in other room • When tried to get closer to someone in other place had opposite effect - went out of range of camera and microphone • No way of monitoring this www.id-book.com Videoconferencing and telepresence rooms www.id-book.com • Many to choose from to connect multiple people (e.g. Zoom) • Customized telepresence rooms for groups Telepresence robots • Enable people to attend events who could not such by controlling their robot remotely – in places such as schools, conferences, museums – Early example: Beam+ – Often dressed up to appear like the person to others at the event – Positive experience of being there www.id-book.com Susan Lechelt at ACM CHI Telepresence and social presence • Telepresence refers to one party being present with another party, who is present in a physical space, such as a meeting room • Social presence refers to the feeling of being there with a real person when in virtual reality www.id-book.com Facebook’s vision of socializing in a 3D world using VR • Two avatars talking at a virtual table • Users experience each other through donning VR headsets www.id-book.com How much realism and immersion are necessary..? • …in telepresence to make it compelling? • Telepresence rooms try to make remote people appear to be life-like – use multiple high def cameras with eye- tracking features and directional microphones • Does FaceTime have as much presence as more high def settings? www.id-book.com What is co-presence? • Co-located groups who want to collaborate • Many technologies have been designed to – enable groups to work, learn and socialise more effectively together – e.g. tabletops, whiteboards, public displays www.id-book.com Coordination mechanisms • When a group of people act or interact together they need to coordinate themselves – e.g., playing football, navigating a ship • To do so they use: – verbal and non-verbal communication – schedules, rules, and conventions – shared external representations www.id-book.com F2F coordinating mechanisms • Talk is central • Non-verbal also used to emphasize and as a substitute – e.g. nods, shakes, winks, glances, gestures and hand-raising • Formal meetings – explicit structures such as agendas, memos, and minutes are employed to coordinate the activity www.id-book.com Awareness mechanisms • Involves knowing who is around, what is happening, and who is talking with whom (Dourish and Bly, 1992) • Peripheral awareness – keeping an eye on things happening in the periphery of vision – Overhearing and overseeing - allows tracking of what others are doing without explicit cues • Situational awareness – being aware of what is happening around you in order to understand how info and your actions will affect ongoing and future events • e.g. air traffic control, operating theatre www.id-book.com Sharable interfaces • Designed to capitalise on existing forms of coordination and awareness mechanisms • Several studies investigating whether they do help people to work together better, have found: – More equitable participation – More natural to work around – More comfortable sitting around a table than standing in front of a display www.id-book.com The Reflect Table • LEDs lit up to reflect how much each member of the group spoke • Used microphones in front of each individual to do this • Study showed those who spoke the most changed their behavior the most • Those who spoke the least did not change their behavior • Why do you think this is? www.id-book.com Sococo floor plan of a virtual office: who is where and who meeting with whom www.id-book.com Playing together in same space • Visitors using an AR sandbox at the V&A • Visitors sculpt landscapes out of sand • System reacts with changing superimposed digital colored landscape • Enables creative forms of collaboration www.id-book.com Social engagement • Refers to participation in activities of a social groups • Social exchange where people give or receive something from others • Voluntary, unpaid and often altruistic (in the sense of sharing and doing good for others) • Websites often used as hub to connect people • Rewetting is a powerful way of connecting millions of people… www.id-book.com 30 Retweeting goes viral • The epic Twitter battle between Ellen DeGeneres and Carter Wilkerson • Millions retweeted in the space of hours • Connected millions of people for a fun cause • Many people found it amusing to join in and watch the numbers grow www.id-book.com Dilemma: is it ok to talk with a dead person using a chatbot? • Eugenia Kuyda lost a close friend in a car accident who was only in his 20s • She took all his texts sent over the course of his life and made a chatbot using them • Chatbot responds to text messages so that Eugenia can talk to her friend as if he was alive • Is this a creepy or comforting way to deal with grief? – Is it respectful of the dead person? www.id-book.com Summary • Social interaction is central to or everyday lives • Social mechanisms, like turn-taking, enable us to collaborate and coordinate our activities • Keeping aware of what others are doing and letting others know what you are doing are important aspects of collaborative working and socialising • Many technologies systems have been built to support telepresence, social presence and co- presence • Social media has brought about significant changes in how people keep in touch and manage their social lives www.id-book.com","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
