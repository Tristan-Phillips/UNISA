BARCODE 2 Assignment 01 Total score = 90 marks (100%) Due date: see tutorial letter 101 Question 1 (Chapter 1) (24 marks) 1.1 What is interaction design? (2 marks) Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives 1.2 Give a brief job description for an interaction desiger (1 mark) An interaction designer is the person on the design, development, creative or marketing team that helps form and create a design strategy, identify key interactions of the product, create prototypes to test concepts and stay current on technology and trends that will impact user (https://designmodo.com/interaction-design/). 1.3 What is the difference between interaction design (ID) and Human Cmputer Interaction (HCI)? (4 marks) ID is concerned with theory, research and practice of designing user experiences for all manner of technologies, systems and products. HCI is concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them 1.4 List different things that interaction designers need to know about interactions between users and technologies in order for them to create effective user experience. (4 marks) They need to understand:  How people act and react to events  How they communicate and interact with each other  How emotions work  The meaning of aesthetics, desirability and the role of narrative in human experience 1.5 What are the aspects of user experience that can be considered when designing interactive products? List any five (5 marks ).  Usability  Functionality  Aesthetics  The content  The look and feel  Sensual emotional appeal INF3720/102 3  Fun  Health  Social capital  Cultural identity 1.6 Discuss McCarthy and Wright’s (2004) core threads that make up holistic experiences (8 marks)  Sensual  Emotional  Compositional  Spatio-temporal Question 2 (Chapter 2) (21 marks) 2.1 What do you understand by the term conceptual model? (2 marks)  An abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Or  A high level description of how a system is organized and operates Or  A working strategy or a framework of general concepts and their interrelations  What are the benefits of conceptualizing the design space? (6 marks)  Orientation- enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model would be understood by the targeted users  Open mindedness – preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focused early on  Common ground - allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstanding and confusion arising latter 2.2 Why are interface metaphors important in interaction design? (2 marks) They provide familiar entities that enable people to readily understand the underlying conceptual model and know what to do at an interface. Metaphors are used to explain something that is unfamiliar or hard to grasp by a way of comparison with something that is familiar or easy to use 2.3 Briefly describe the interface metaphor behind the desktop computer (5 marks) An office with a desk, papers, folders, filing cabinets, mailboxes and, dust bean. 4 2.4 In many African countries and other developing countries alike, illiteracy is a hindrance to the adoption of mobile technological services. As an interaction designer, briefly describe the main interaction types that you would use to design a train-booking system for a semi-illiterate community. In order for you to answer this question, you are required to read the following additional paper loaded under additional resources on myUnisa: Text –Free Interfaces for Illiterate and semi-literate Users, written by Medhi, Sagar and Toyama (2007). (6 marks)  Text in the form of numbers  Motion videos  Graphics and photos that are interactive  Voice input and feedback  Touch screen  mouse input or as articulated by other students Manipulating: The use of the semi abstract graphics and increase photorealism with deeper interaction, where users interact with objects in a virtual space by manipulating it. The image of train tickets and color will enables users to feel that they are directly controlling the digital objects represented by the computer. This will also help beginners to learn basic functionality rapidly and allowing infrequent users to remember how to carry out operations over time, it will also helping users gain confidence. Instructing: The train booking system will be an instructive system. This can be done in various ways such as having, touch command or speaking commands functionality, to ask for a train booking as the users are illiterate and semi illiterate. The main benefit of designing an interaction based on issuing instructions is that the interaction is quick and efficient. And it will accommodate them. The application is a text free user interface. Exploring: The intended users will be able to explore other text free user interfaces to book tickets from other booking systems apart from train booking system. Such as virtual environments include 3D worlds and virtual reality systems. Conversing: The system will be a conversional style that will allow the users (illiterate and semi – illiterate) to interact with a system in a more familiar way. The users will have to dialogue the system when they are booking for ticket. However the main interaction type which is the speaking command will allow the illiterate user to engage in a dialogue such that the system will ask for the departure date and the user will respond. Question 3 (Chapter 4) (10 marks) Discuss how social media have changed the way in which students keep in touch, make contact, and manage their social and learning life. (10 marks) The discussion should focus on how social media can facilitate the following: (Allocate marks appropriately, 2 marks for discussing each component and providing succinct examples that are applicable to the learning of students)  Collaboration  Communication  Interaction  Establishing social communities (groups)  Sharing of resources INF3720/102 5 Pay attention on:  Enhanced outreach (opportunity to reach out to others: students, family and friends)  Real time engagement (telepresence, co-presence) as groups or one to one interaction and collaboration  Speed of knowledge dissemination (broadcasting, #hashtags)  Planning and coordination  Sharing of resources  Choice of communication channel (text, video, voice) Question 4 (Chapter 5) (15 marks) 4.1 What is emotional interaction and what does it entail? (5 marks)  How people feel and react when interacting with technology (1 mark)  Covers different aspects of user experience from how we feel (happy, sad, annoyed ..) when first finding out about a new product to getting read of it (2 marks)  Looks at why people become emotionally attached to certain products, how social robots might help reduce loneliness and how to change human behaviour through the use of emotive feedback (2 marks) 4.2 In interaction design, explain the term anthropomorphism and its disadvantages. (10 marks)  attributing human qualities to object ( 2 marks)  Has been used in interaction design and the implications of designing applications that have human-like qualities. A number of virtual characters and robot pets are described that have been developed to motivate people to learn, buy, and listen and we consider how useful and appropriate they are. disadvantages(8 marks)  Deceptive, make people feel anxious, inferior or stupid  People tend not to like screen characters that wave their fingers at the user & say: Now Chris, that’s not right. You can do better than that. Try again.”  Studies have shown that personalized feedback is considered to be less honest and makes users feel less responsible for their actions (e.g. Quintanar, 1982)  Lack the ability to follow a conversation and fail to suggest appropriate help.  Speech recognition systems incorrectly may translate people say.  If the technology is targeted for novice users, experts may become frustrated.  Giving users no control over the system frustrates users.  The systems deceive users because they think that computers have all human capabilities, hence they blame them when something goes wrong.  Agents cannot give some common examples that are not related to the current problem Question 5 (Chapter 7) (20 marks) This question involves a practical data gathering exercise. 6 Suppose you have to design a robotic toy that looks just like a normal doll or toy car, but displays some intelligent interactive behaviour towards a child playing with it. Your aim is to find out from a child what functionality they would like such a toy to have. You have to conduct an interview with at least one child between pre-school and grade three (ages 6 to 9 years). Markers are expected to mark this question accordingly since a variety of answers would be given by the students. Allocate marks approprietly. 5.1 What type of interview would you conduct with the child? Please justify your choice. (5 marks) 5.2 Formulate at least five appropriate interview questions. Do not include biographic questions. (5 marks) 5.3 Conduct the interview and discuss your findings with regard to emerging design ideas. (10 marks The end © 2018","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
