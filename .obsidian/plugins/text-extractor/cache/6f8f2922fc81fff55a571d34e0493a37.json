All people who do not smoke and attend parties are happy. . Single people attend parties. . John is single and does not smoke. . Happy people have exciting lives. Answer the following questions. 1. Translate the given sentences into predicate logic. 2. Use resolution refutation to show that someone has an exciting life. Solution Translation of the given sentences into First Order Logic (FOL): . ∀x [(¬smoke(x) ∧ party(x)) =⇒ happy(x)] . ∀y [single(y) =⇒ party(y)] . single(john) ∧ ¬smoke(john) . ∀z [happy(z) =⇒ exciting(z)] It is important to standardize the variables (to use diﬀerent variable names for diﬀerent statements) in order to avoid confusion when dropping the universal quantiﬁers. The above statements are converted to clausal form as follows: . smoke(x) ∨ ¬party(x) ∨ happy(x) . ¬single(y) ∨ party(y) . single(john) . ¬smoke(john) . ¬happy(z) ∨ exciting(z) Note that universal quantiﬁers have been dropped because all variables were universally quantiﬁed. Skolem functions are introduced only to remove existential quantiﬁers. (See the section on Resolution in the chapter First Order Logic of the prescribed textbook.) We would like to use resolution refutation to show that someone has an exciting life. So the goal is: ∃w, exciting(w). At this stage it is important to keep the existential quantiﬁer of the goal. We will deal with quantiﬁers after the goal is negated. In this case, if skolemisation is applied to the goal before it is negated, the meaning of the goal will be changed and the resolution 1 refutation proof will be incorrect. The negation of the goal is: ¬[∃w, exciting(w)] ≡ ∀w, ¬exciting(w). We may drop the universal quantiﬁer in the negated goal. We now use resolution refutation. We resolve the premises together with the negated goal until the empty clause is generated. 1. smoke(x) ∨ ¬party(x) ∨ happy(x) (assumption) 2. ¬single(y) ∨ party(y) (assumption) 3. single(john) (assumption) 4. ¬smoke(john) (assumption) 5. ¬happy(z) ∨ exciting(z) (assumption) 6. ¬exciting(w) (negated goal) 7. ¬happy(z) (5&6, z/w) 8. smoke(x) ∨ ¬party(x) (1&7, x/z) 9. ¬single(y) ∨ smoke(y) (2&8, y/x) 10. ¬single(john) (4&9, john/y) 11. [ ] (3&10) Since resolving the negated goal together with the given statements yields the empty clause, this means that the goal can indeed be inferred from those statements. 2","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
