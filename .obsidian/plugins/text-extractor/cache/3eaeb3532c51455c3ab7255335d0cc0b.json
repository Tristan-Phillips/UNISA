Three jackals and three goats come to a river. There is a boat on their side of the river that can be used by either one or two animals. All six animals must cross the river. However the jackals must not outnumber the goats at any time, in any place. It is fine to have an equal number of each, and it is also fine to have more goats than jackals in a given place. We want to determine how the animals should use the boat to ensure all of them cross the river safely. (a) Define a non-graphical (i.e. no pictures) state representation for the board. Your state representation should be such that a search algorithm will be able to start the search at any given state. (b) Defend your choice by showing that the level of abstraction is sufficient (Hint: Your state representation should only encode the necessary information). (c) Define appropriate actions for this problem. Using the successor function Result(a,S) +— S, show how applying the action a to state S results in state S’ (Hint: Provide an example action «, a state S, and the resulting state S\"). (d) Using the state representation you defined above, draw a search tree that shows the entire search space beginning at the start node. Include all the possible states, however, do not show the illegal states (in which jackals outnumber goats on either side of the river).","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
