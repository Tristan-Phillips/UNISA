You are required to design and evaluate an interactive product for booking tickets online for a cinema. A user is supposed to be able to book a venue for watching a movie. Most cinema venues have an online booking facility already, but it can be awkward and frustrating to identify and book the seats you want. For you to successfully answer this question, you need you talk with some people to understand their requirements, maybe a family member (20 marks). 1.1 Identify users’ needs (requirements) for the online facility. To identify user needs, you should collect data from the users. Record your data in point form (5 marks). 1.2 Based on the user requirements, choose a user profile, and produce one persona and one scenario, capturing how the user is expected to interact with the product. (Students are expected to provide a user profile and produce one persona, then describe a scenario in detail, capturing how the user is expected to interact with a system, for example, a ticket booking system) (5 marks). 1.3 Perform a task analysis on the main tasks associated with the ticket booking system, i.e booking a ticket (5 marks). 1.4 Using the data gathered in 1.1 and your subsequent analysis, identify different kinds of requirements for the product under the following headings: environmental, user and usability (5 marks). Question 2 Go to myUnisa under Additional resources and download the file “Case study – Academic library. pdf”. Read the case study and answer the following questions. (20 marks) 2.1 What was the purpose of the usability evaluation? (2 marks) 2.2 Which challenges were encountered in carrying the usability testing of the website? (4 marks) 2.3 List any five specific activities/tasks performed by the participants during the usability testing of the website. (5 marks) 2.4 Which data collection methods were used to collect data? (4 marks) 4 2.5 List any five issues discovered by the usability testing. (5 marks) Question 3 Assume the role of an expert evaluator and do a heuristic evaluation of a single typical student task that you have identified as a possible problem on myUnisa. Use all ten heuristics and complete the table below. (20 marks) Name of the task:_________________ Heuristic Findings 1. Visibility of the system status 2. Match between system and the real world 3. User control and real world 4. Consistency and standards 5. Error prevention 6. Flexibility and efficiency of use 7. Recognition rather than recall 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 9. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors 10. Help and documentation The End ©UNISA 2022","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
