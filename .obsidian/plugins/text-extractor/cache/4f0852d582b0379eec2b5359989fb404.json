The user communicates with the computer via the operating system, which is therefore an extremely important software component of the computer system. Furthermore, techniques developed for operating systems influence many other areas of computer science, including computer architecture, programming languages, compilers, databases, computer networks and mobile agents. This module assumes a background in general assembly language programming and computer organisation (COS2621). 2 PURPOSE AND OUTCOMES 2.1 Purpose Students who successfully complete this module will be able to develop the knowledge, skills and competencies of the functionality of general operating systems including CPU scheduling, process coordination and concurrency, deadlocks, memory management, protection and security within distributed systems, which will support further studies and applications in Computer Science in the field of Operating Systems. It provides the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies to understand how the user communicates with the computer via the operating system and how the techniques developed for operating systems influence many other areas of Computer Science, including computer architecture, programming languages, compilers, databases, computer networks and mobile agents. The module is delivered via myUnisa, the Internet, peer group interaction, and community engagement in some of the activities. Your Lecturers will interact with students on myUnisa and via email. 2.2 Outcomes For this module, there are several outcomes that we hope you will be able to accomplish by the end of the course: • Specific outcome 1: Understand the basics principles of computer system organization and be able to identify different operating system components. • Specific outcome 2: Apply operating systems principles to solve process management problems. • Specific outcome 3: Apply operating system principles to solve memory management problems. • Specific outcome 4: Explain electronic storage management issues. • Specific outcome 5: Explain security and protection issues for operating systems • Specific outcome 6: Discuss issues relevant for distributed systems 4 3 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 3.1 Lecturer(s) Please see the COSALL tutorial letters for the telephone numbers of the lecturers on this module.

If a request from process P1 arrives for (0,4,2,0), can the request be granted immediately? 1.2 Is it possible to have a deadlock involving only one single-threaded process? Explain your answer. Question 2 - Based on Chapter 8 of SGG 2.1 Explain why mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android do not support swapping. 2.2 Program binaries in many systems are typically structured as follows. Code is stored starting with a small, fixed virtual address, such as 0. The code segment is followed by the data segment that is used for storing the program variables. When the program starts executing, the stack is allocated at the other end of the virtual address space and is COS3721/101/3/2018 13 allowed to grow toward lower virtual addresses. What is the significance of this structure for the following schemes? a. Contiguous memory allocation b. Pure segmentation c. Pure paging Question 3 - Based on Chapter 9 of SGG 3.1 Consider the following page reference string: 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 6. How many page faults would occur for the following replacement algorithms, assuming one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven frames? Remember that all frames are initially empty, so your first unique pages will cost one fault each. • LRU replacement • FIFO replacement • Optimal replacement 3.2 Assume that we have a demand-paged memory. The page table is held in registers. It takes 8 milliseconds to service a page fault if an empty frame is available or if the replaced page is not modified and 20 milliseconds if the replaced page is modified. Memory-access time is 100 nanoseconds. Assume that the page to be replaced is modified 70 percent of the time. What is the maximum acceptable page-fault rate for an effective access time of no more than 200 nanoseconds? Question 4 - Based on Chapter 10 of SGG 4.1 Is disk scheduling, other than FCFS scheduling, useful in a single-user environment? Explain your answer. 4.2 Explain why SSTF scheduling tends to favor middle cylinders over the innermost and outermost cylinders. Question 5 - Based on Chapter 11 of SGG 5.1 Consider a file system in which a file can be deleted and its disk space reclaimed while links to that file still exist. What problems may occur if a new file is created in the same storage area or with the same absolute path name? How can these problems be avoided? 5.2 What are the advantages and disadvantages of providing mandatory locks instead of advisory locks whose use is left to users’ discretion? 14 Question 6 - Based on Chapter 14 of SGG 6.1 The access-control matrix can be used to determine whether a process can switch from, say, domain A to domain B and enjoy the access privileges of domain B. Is this approach equivalent to including the access privileges of domain B in those of domain A? 6.2 Consider a computer system in which computer games can be played by students only between 10 P.M. and 6 A.M., by faculty members between 5 P.M. and 8 A.M., and by the computer center staff at all times. Suggest a scheme for implementing this policy efficiently. Assignment 1 – Semester 2 Due Date: 27 August 2018 Submission Procedure: Written/Typed. Submission online via myUnisa in a PDF format; Chapters in SGG: Chapters 1 – 6 and 18 (section 18.1 and 18.2) Question 1 – Based on Chapter 1 of SGG 1.1 What is the purpose of interrupts?

Include the types of people who would find each aspect to be an advantage or a disadvantage. Question 2 - Based on Chapter 2 of SGG 2.1 What are the two models of inter process communication? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches? 2.2 Explain why Java programs running on Android systems do not use the standard Java API and virtual machine. Question 3 - Based on Chapter 3 of SGG 3.1 Give an example of a situation in which ordinary pipes are more suitable than named pipes and an example of a situation in which named pipes are more suitable than ordinary pipes. COS3721/101/3/2018 15 3.2 What are the benefits and the disadvantages of each of the following? Consider both the system level and the programmer level. a. Synchronous and asynchronous communication b. Automatic and explicit buffering c. Send by copy and send by reference d. Fixed-sized and variable-sized messages Question 4 - Based on Chapter 4 of SGG 4.1 Can a multithreaded solution using multiple user-level threads achieve better performance on a multiprocessor system than on a single processor system? Explain. 4.2 In Chapter 3, we discussed Google’s Chrome browser and its practice of opening each new website in a separate process. Would the same benefits have been achieved if instead Chrome had been designed to open each new website in a separate thread? Explain. Question 5 - Based on Chapter 5 of SGG 5.1 Describe two kernel data structures in which race conditions are possible. Be sure to include a description of how a race condition can occur. 5.2 Explain why implementing synchronization primitives by disabling interrupts is not appropriate in a single-processor system if the synchronization primitives are to be used in user-level programs. Question 6 - Based on Chapter 6 of SGG 6.1 Discuss how the following pairs of scheduling criteria conflict in certain settings. a. CPU utilization and response time b. Average turnaround time and maximum waiting time c. I/O device utilization and CPU utilization 6.2 The following processes are being scheduled using a preemptive, round robin scheduling algorithm. Each process is assigned a numerical priority, with a higher number indicating a higher relative priority. In addition to the processes listed below, the system also has an idle task (which consumes no CPU resources and is identified as Pidle ). This task has priority 0 and is scheduled whenever the system has no other available processes to run. The length of a time quantum is 10 units. If a process is preempted by a higher-priority process, the preempted process is placed at the end of the queue. 16 a. Show the scheduling order of the processes using a Gantt chart. b. What is the turnaround time for each process? c. What is the waiting time for each process? d. What is the CPU utilization rate? 6.3 Which of the following scheduling algorithms could result in starvation? a. First-come, first-served b. Shortest job first c. Round robin d. Priority Assignment 2 – Semester 2 Due Date: 27 September 2017 Submission Procedure: Written/Typed. Submission online via myUnisa in a PDF format; Chapters in SGG: Chapters 7 – 11 and 14 – 16 Question 1 - Based on Chapter 7 of SGG 1.1 Consider the following snapshot of s system: COS3721/101/3/2018 17 Answer the following questions using the banker’s algorithm: a. Illustrate that the system is in a safe state by demonstrating an order in which the processes may complete. b. If a request from process P1 arrives for (1, 1, 0, 0), can the request be granted immediately? c. If a request from process P4 arrives for (0, 0, 2, 0), can the request be granted immediately? 1.2 What is the optimistic assumption made in the deadlock-detection algorithm? How can this assumption be violated? Question 2 - Based on Chapter 8 of SGG 1.1 Although Android does not support swapping on its boot disk, it is possible to set up a swap space using a separate SD nonvolatile memory card. Why would Android disallow swapping on its boot disk yet allow it on a secondary disk? 1.2 Assuming a 1-KB page size, what are the page numbers and offsets for the following address references (provided as decimal numbers): a. 3085 b. 42095 c. 215201 d. 650000 e. 2000001 Question 3 - Based on Chapter 9 of SGG 3.1 Consider the following page reference string: 7, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 1, 0, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 0, 1. Assuming demand paging with three frames, how many page faults would occur for the following replacement algorithms? • LRU replacement • FIFO replacement • Optimal replacement 3.2 When a page fault occurs, the process requesting the page must block while waiting for the page to be brought from disk into physical memory. Assume that there exists a process with five user-level threads and that the mapping of user threads to kernel threads is one to one. If one user thread incurs a page fault while accessing its stack, would the other user threads belonging to the same process also be affected by the page fault—that is, would they also have to wait for the faulting page to be brought into memory? Explain. 18 Question 4 - Based on Chapter 10 of SGG 4.1 Why is it important to balance file-system I/O among the disks and controllers on a system in a multitasking environment? 4.2 What are the tradeoffs involved in rereading code pages from the file system versus using swap space to store them? Question 5 - Based on Chapter 11 of SGG 5.1 The open-file table is used to maintain information about files that are currently open. Should the operating system maintain a separate table for each user or maintain just one table that contains references to files that are currently being accessed by all users? If the same file is being accessed by two different programs or users, should there be separate entries in the open-file table? Explain. 5.2 Provide examples of applications that typically access files according to the following methods: • Sequential • Random Question 6 - Based on Chapter 14 of SGG 6.1 What hardware features does a computer system need for efficient capability manipulation? Can these features be used for memory protection? 6.2 Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of implementing an access matrix using access lists that are associated with objects. 8.7 Other assessment methods No other assessment methods on this module. 8.8 The examination You exam is written in May/June for semester 1 students and October/November for semester two students.
