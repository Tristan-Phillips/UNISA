In the case of interaction design, this includes understanding the target users and the support an interactive product could usefully provide.  Designing Alternatives o This is the core activity of designing. proposing ideas for meeting the requirements. For interaction design, this activity can be viewed as two subactivities: conceptual design and concrete design. Conceptual design involves producing the conceptual model for the product, and a conceptual model describes an abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Concrete design considers the detail of the product including the colors, sounds, and images to use, menu design, and icon design. Alternatives are considered at every point.  Prototyping o Interaction design involves designing the behaviour of interactive products as well as their look and feel. The most effective way for users to evaluate such designs is to interact with them, and this can be achieved through prototyping. There are different prototyping techniques, not all of which require a working piece of software. For example, paper-based prototypes are quick and cheap to build and are effective for identifying problems in the early stages of design, and through role- playing users can get a real sense of what it will be like to interact with the product.  Evaluating o It is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design measured in terms of a variety of usability and user-experience criteria. Evaluation does not replace activities concerned with quality assurance and testing to make sure that the final product is fit for its intended purpose, but it complements and enhances them. Five Key Issues on data gathering  Setting Goals o The main reason for gathering data is to glean information about users, their behaviour, or their reaction to technology.  Identifying Participants o The goals developed for the data gathering session will indicate the types of people from whom data is to be gathered. Those people who fit this profile are called the population or study population.  Relationship with Participants o One significant aspect of any data gathering is the relationship between the person ( o people) doing the gathering and the person (people) providing the data. Making sure that this relationship is clear and professional will help to clarify the nature of the study. How this is achieved varies in different countries and different settings.  Triangulation o Triangulation is a term used to refer to the investigation of a phenomenon from (at least) two different perspectives (Denzin, 2006; Jupp, 2006). Four types of triangulation have been defined (Jupp, 2006). o Triangulation of data means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in different places, or from different people (possibly by using a different sampling technique). o Investigator triangulation means that different researchers (observers, interviewers, and so on) have been involved in collecting and interpreting the data. o Triangulation of theories means the use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view the data or findings. o Methodological triangulation means to employ different data gathering techniques.  Pilot studies o A pilot study is a small trial run of the main study. The aim is to make sure that the proposed method is viable before embarking on the real study. Issues That Influence the Choice of Method and How the Data Is Interpreted  Reliability: The reliability or consistency of a method is how well it produces the same results on sperate occasions under the same circumstances. Different evaluation methods have different degrees of reliability.  Validity: Validity is concerned with weather the evaluation method measures what it is intended to measure. This encompasses both the method itself and the way it is implemented.  Ecological validity: This is particular kind of validity that concerns how the environment in which an evaluation is conducted influences or even distorts the results. This is also affected when the participants are aware of being studied.  Bias: This occurs when the results are distorted. When collecting observational data, researchers may consistently fail to notice certain types of behaviour because they do not deem them important.  Scope: The scope of an evaluation study refers to how much its findings can be generalised.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
