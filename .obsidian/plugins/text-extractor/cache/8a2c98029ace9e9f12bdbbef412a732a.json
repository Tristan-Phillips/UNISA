We usually want to sort lists of things that are ordered in such a way that any two things are comparable in terms of the order relation, i.e. given two different things in the list, we want to be sure that one of them comes before the other. So we might as well give a special name to ; the order relations we are most likely to use. -'.‘_ Definition: A total (or line; > : . .
