(5, ¢), (a a). (b, 1), (c, 2)} Answer: Alternative 4 Discussion We look at the definitions of a function and of surjectivity: Suppose R B x C is a binary relation from a set B to a set C. We may call R a function from B 1o C if every element of B appears exactly once as the first co-ordinate of an ordered pair in R (i.e. fis functional), and the domain of R is exactly the set B, ie dom(R) = B. A function R from B to C is surjective iff ran(R) = C. WehaveU={1,2,3,4,5,a,bcjandA=(a,b,c,1,23,4). We consider the relations provided in the different alternatives: 3 1. LetL={(1,4),(2,b),(3,3),(4,3), (5, a). (a,c). (b, 1), (c. b)} (say). It is the case that 2 € A but 2is not a second co-ordinate in any ordered pair of L thus ran(L) # A. Thus L is not surjective. 2. LetM = {(a, 1), (b, 2). (c. &), (1, 4), (2, b). (3. 3), (4, )} (say). It is the case that 5 « U but 5 is not a first co-ordinate in any element of M. We have dom(M) = {1, 2,3,4,a.b, c} #U. Thus M is not a function from U to A and thus cannot be a surjective function. 3. LetN={(1,a),(2 c), (3.b), (4, 1), (a c), (b, 2), (c, 3)} (say). For the same reason as provided in alternative 2, N is not a function. Thus N is not a surjective function. 4. LetS={(1,a), (2, b), (3,4), (4,3), (5 c).(a a), (b 1), (c, 2)} (say). S is a function since it is functional and dom(S) = U, and furthermore, ran(S) = A thus S is a surjective function. From the arguments provided we can deduce that altemative 4 should be selected.
