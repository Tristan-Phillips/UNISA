Remember the symbol for iff is ↔. To do this, you convert the statement into words. Example 1. Prove that 𝑨 ∪ (𝑩 ∪ 𝑪) = (𝑨 ∪ 𝑩) ∪ 𝑪 for all sets 𝑨, 𝑩, 𝑪 ⊆ 𝑼. To start off, assume that 𝑥 is an element of the statement on the left: Let 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∪ (𝐵 ∪ 𝐶). Then start the proof. Convert all the ∪ and ∩ symbols to words. 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∪ (𝐵 ∪ 𝐶) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 or 𝑥 ∈ (𝐵 ∪ 𝐶) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 or 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵 or 𝑥 ∈ 𝐶 iff (𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 or 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵) or 𝑥 ∈ 𝐶 iff (𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)) or 𝑥 ∈ 𝐶 iff 𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) ∪ 𝐶 ∴ 𝐴 ∪ (𝐵 ∪ 𝐶) = ( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) ∪ 𝐶 𝐴 𝐵 𝐶 2. Prove that 𝑨 ∩ (𝑩 ∩ 𝑪) = (𝑨 ∩ 𝑩) ∩ 𝑪 for all sets 𝑨, 𝑩, 𝑪 ⊆ 𝑼. Let 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∩ (𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∩ (𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 and 𝑥 ∈ (𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝐶 iff (𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵) and 𝑥 ∈ 𝐶 iff (𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)) and 𝑥 ∈ 𝐶 iff 𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) ∩ 𝐶 ∴ 𝐴 ∩ (𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) = ( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) ∩ 𝐶 𝐴 𝐵 𝐶 1 Using Nots A basic application of the not symbol swaps ∈ to ∉. If the statement has a − in, this is the equivalent of and ∉. For example, 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 − 𝐵 = 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 and 𝑥 ∉ 𝐵 Example 1. Prove that (𝑨′)′ = 𝑨 for all sets 𝑨 ⊆ 𝑼. Let 𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴′)′ 𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴′)′ iff 𝑥 ∉ 𝐴′ iff 𝑥 is not ∉ 𝐴 iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∴ ( 𝐴′)′ = 𝐴 𝐴 𝐵 The words swap! When you apply a ∉ sign in words, then ∪ means and instead of or, and ∩ means or instead of and. Example 1. Prove that (𝑨 ∪ 𝑩)′ = 𝑨′ ∩ 𝑩′. (De Morgan’s Theorem) Let 𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)′. 𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)′ iff 𝑥 ∉ ( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) iff 𝑥 ∉ 𝐴 and 𝑥 ∉ 𝐵 (Note the use of and instead of or for ∪) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴′ and 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵′ iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴′ ∩ 𝐵′ ∴ ( 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)′ = 𝐴′ ∩ 𝐵′ 𝐴 𝐵 2. Prove that (𝑨 ∩ 𝑩)′ = 𝑨′ ∪ 𝑩′. (De Morgan’s Theorem) Let 𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)′. 𝑥 ∈ ( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)′ iff 𝑥 ∉ ( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) iff 𝑥 ∉ 𝐴 or 𝑥 ∉ 𝐵 (Note the use of or instead of and for ∩) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴′ or 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵′ iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴′ ∪ 𝐵′ ∴ ( 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)′ = 𝐴′ ∪ 𝐵′ 𝐴 𝐵 Self-Assessment Exercise 6 1.

Prove the following using iff statements. (a) 𝑿 − (𝒀 ∩ 𝑾) = (𝑿 − 𝒀) ∪ (𝑿 − 𝑾) Let 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 − (𝑌 ∩ 𝑊). 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 − (𝑌 ∩ 𝑊) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and 𝑥 ∉ (𝑌 ∩ 𝑊) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and (𝑥 ∉ 𝑌 or 𝑥 ∉ 𝑊) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and (𝑥 ∈ 𝑌 ′ or 𝑥 ∈ 𝑊′) iff (𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝑌 ′) or (𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝑊′) iff (𝑥 ∈ (𝑋 ∩ 𝑌 ′)) or (𝑥 ∈ (𝑋 ∩ 𝑊′)) iff (𝑥 ∈ (𝑋 − 𝑌 )) or (𝑥 ∈ (𝑋 − 𝑊)) iff 𝑥 ∈ (𝑋 − 𝑌 ) ∪ (𝑋 − 𝑊) ∴ 𝑋 − (𝑌 ∩ 𝑊) = (𝑋 − 𝑌 ) ∪ (𝑋 − 𝑊) 𝑋 𝑌 𝑊 (b) 𝑿 ∩ (𝒀 ∪ 𝑾) = (𝑿 ∩ 𝒀) ∪ (𝑿 ∩ 𝑾) Let 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 ∩ (𝑌 ∪ 𝑊). 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 ∩ (𝑌 ∪ 𝑊) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and 𝑥 ∈ (𝑌 ∪ 𝑊) iff 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and (𝑥 ∈ 𝑌 or 𝑥 ∈ 𝑊) iff (𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝑌 ) or (𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝑊) iff (𝑥 ∈ (𝑋 ∩ 𝑌 )) or (𝑥 ∈ (𝑋 ∩ 𝑊)) iff 𝑥 ∈ (𝑋 ∩ 𝑌 ) ∪ (𝑋 ∩ 𝑊) ∴ 𝑋 ∩ (𝑌 ∪ 𝑊) = (𝑋 ∩ 𝑌 ) ∪ (𝑋 ∩ 𝑊) 𝑋 𝑌 𝑊 3","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
