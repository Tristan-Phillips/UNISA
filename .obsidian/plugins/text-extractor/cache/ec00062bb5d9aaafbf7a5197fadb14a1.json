The solutions will be posted soon. The selection of questions is at the e-tutor’s own discretion who has no knowledge whatsoever of the examination’s content. The whole syllabus as prescribed by the main lecturer of the module is applicable in preparation for the examination. 1 State spaces Consider the game of Tic-Tac-Toe in which two players alternate putting marks in a 3 × 3 board. One player marks crosses (referred to as Player X) and the other marks circles (referred to as Player O). The ﬁrst player to have a complete row, column or diagonal ﬁlled in with her marks wins and the game ends. The game may also end in a draw if the board is full but no player has 3 marks on the same line. Initially the board is empty as in Figure a below (a dash sign represents an empty cell). - - - - - - - - - Figure a: Initial state - - - - x - - - - Figure b: After one move - - x - x - o o - Figure c: After four moves Answer the following questions. 1. Deﬁne a non-graphical state representation for the board in Figure a above. 2. Assume Player X plays ﬁrst by placing her mark as depicted in Figure b above. Use your state representation to represent this state. 3. Assume the game reaches the state depicted in Figure c above and it is Player X’s turn to play next. Draw the complete search tree that shows the next two plies of the game. 1 2 Constraint Satisfaction Problem Suppose you are organising a mathematics conference. You have several people setting up special sessions in their area of expertise. You are trying to ﬁnd a way to schedule the sessions so that if there are overlapping interests, you can make sure the sessions happen at diﬀerent times. To that end, you have asked each session organiser to tell you what broad ﬁelds of mathematics their topic concerns. You have the following list: - Probabilistic Combinatorics (PC): of interest to Analysts, Combinatorialists, and Probabilists. - Algebraic Combinatorics (AC): of interest to Algebraists and Combinatorialists. - Enumerative Combinatorics (EC): of interest to Combinatorialists and Representa- tion Theorists. - Ramsey Theory (RT): of interest to Combinatorialists and Probabilists. - Markov Chains (MC): of interest to Probabilists. - Brownian Motion (BM): of interest to Probabilists and Analysts. - Operator Theory (OT): of interest to Analysts. You would like to schedule the shortest conference possible, using as few time slots as possible so you do not have to pay for the rooms for too long. Now answer these questions. 1. Deﬁne the variables and their domains for this scheduling problem. 2. Provide the constraint graph for this problem. 3. Determine the smallest number of time slots you could use to accommodate every session, where no two topics run at the same time if they have overlapping interests. 3 First Order Logic The following English statements are given: . All people who do not smoke and attend parties are happy. . Single people attend parties. . John is single and does not smoke. . Happy people have exciting lives. Answer the following questions. 1. Translate the given sentences into predicate logic. 2. Use resolution refutation to show that someone has an exciting life. 2 No Hair Height Weight Lotion Result 1 blonde average light no sunburned 2 blonde tall average yes none 3 brown short average yes none 4 blonde short average no sunburned 5 red average heavy no sunburned 6 brown tall heavy no none 7 brown average heavy no none 8 blonde short light yes none Table 1: Data about factors aﬀecting sunburn 4 Machine Learning Table 1 shows a set of data that has been collected to determine which factors aﬀect sunburn. The value ‘sunburned’ indicates people who got sunburned, whereas ‘none’ indicates people who did not get sunburned. Answer the following questions. 1. Calculate the entropy of the set of data presented in the table above. 2. Calculate the information gain of the attribute ‘Hair’. 3","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
