For C0S1501 we could not create an MCQ exam, due to mathematical symbols not being handled correctly by the system. But we have something very similar. You will get the question plus the options (a, b, c and d instead of 1, 2, 3 and 4 that you are used to), and you then have to type the option that you choose, e.g. b. You should only type the one letter - nothing else - otherwise the system will mark it incorrectly. Attached to this announcement is a document explaining what to expect. Most lecturers have not used this online assessment before, so it is new to everyone. I'm going to post a mock exam of 10 questions only, at two different times, each giving you two attempts. (The proper exam will of course only give you one attempt). I'm scheduling two mock exams for Tuesday 21 April to accommodate more students. Please try and do one of these sessions, as these are the only 2 sessions that will be scheduled now. | may at a later stage set up another session after working through your comments. The times for the sessions on Tuesday will be 10h00 to & v Reply","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
