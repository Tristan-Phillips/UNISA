In response to this charter, we have also placed curriculum transformation high on the agenda. For your information, curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both the programme and module levels, as a phased-in approach. You will notice the implementation in your modules and we encourage you to fully embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa. Welcome to Advanced Systems Development (INF3705). The purpose of this module is to provide you with an advanced level of knowledge, specific skills and applied competencies in systems analysis and design. These competencies will equip you to use concepts to analyse and design high –quality systems in organisations.

Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying other modules at Unisa.  All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online via myUnisa.  All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will complete all your activities and submit all your assignments via myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office.  All communication between you and the university happens online. Your lecturers will communicate with you via email and SMS, and by using the Announcements, Discussion Forums and Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these ways to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 6.2 myUnisa tools We will mainly be using the Lessons tool, which provides the content of, and assessments for, your module. At times you will be directed to join discussions with your fellow students, and to complete activities and assessments before continuing with the module. It is crucial that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you do so at least once a week, to do the following: INF3705/101/3/2020 7  Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife email account so that you receive announcement emails on your cell phone.  Complete the Discussion Forum activities. When you complete the activities for each learning unit, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you will need to go online to post your messages. To this end we provide a Social Cafe where you can socialise with other students taking this module.  Complete other online activities. For certain learning unit activities, you may need to post something on the Blog tool, take a quiz or complete a survey under the Self-Assessment tool. Do not skip these activities, because they will help you complete the assignments and activities for the module. We hope that by giving you extra ways of studying the material and practising all of the activities, you will succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module you MUST go online regularly, to complete the activities and assignments on time. 7 ASSESSMENT 7.1 Assessment plan The following is a breakdown of the formal assessment activities as they become due during the semester: There are two assignment for this module.
