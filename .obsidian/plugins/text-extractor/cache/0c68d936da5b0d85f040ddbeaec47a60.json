It is not necessary to do them as a team. 7 Burnett et al., The GenderMag KitBurnett et al., The GenderMag Kit Background knowledge and skills • Has a new job • Self-described “numbers person” • Knows plenty of math • Likes playing Sudoku and computer puzzle games Motivations and strategies • Proficient with the technology she uses • Doesn’t spend her free time learning new technology • First likes to read about technology before using it Attitude to technology • Medium self-confidence in performing computing tasks • Risk adverse • Explores new features focusing on how they might help her, if they look like they won’t help she will stop trying to use them Background knowledge and skills • Has a new job • Degree in accounting and knows plenty of math • Plays latest video games, owns latest smart phone, hybrid car • Likes to download latest software and experiment with settings Motivations and strategies • Proficient with the technology he uses • Likes learning all the available functionality of all his devices even when he doesn’t need them • Depth-first approach to problem solving. Try the first thing and if that fails, back out and try the next one Attitude to technology • Technology is fun • Very confident with use of technology and thinks he is better at it than most people • Does not give up easily • Thinks that if he can’t fix a problem it is probably the software vendor’s fault • Doesn’t mind taking risks • Likes to tinker and explore, gets easily distracted Think-pair-share 11 Building a persona  Can be used to combine data from other methods  Based on a combination of real people and design requirements gathered from the client  Methods like interviews, focus groups, contextual inquiries, and surveys can be used to learn about the target audience  These should reveal several types of people  Each type you are interested in can be converted to a persona 1213 Stoll, Jennifer, et al. \"Adapting personas for use in security visualization design.\" VizSEC 2007.

Goals, Operations, Methods, and Selection rules – GOMS Time-on-task  How long does it take a user to complete a task or subtask?  One of the most common measurements of usability  Basic setup:  Give the user a task  Start timing them  If you have screen capture software you can time their subtasks too  When they say “done” stop timing them  Measure how long the task takes on your software compared to other similar software 17 Time-on-task  Pros  Easy to understand and easy to measure  No fancy HCI stuff needed, web logs will sometimes work if they have the right data  Basic statistics like t-tests are well suited for this type of data, so easy to do data analysis  Cons  You must measure a large number of people  How many people depends on their variance and how precise of data you need  This is NOT a discount usability method  Very hard to measure how fast a person will be once they get used to using the system 18 Idea: Physically humans are similar, could we use that? 1920 Model human processor GOMS is a method of predicting the time-on-task for an expert user without needing to measure any people 21 Goals, Operations, Methods, and Selection rules (GOMS)  Pros  No need for any experiments  Shockingly accurate  Can avoid costly mistakes for UIs that will be used regularly (think telephone operators)  Cons  Only predicts how fast expert users will be, not novices  Can’t identify any standard usability problems  Assumes that users are complete experts, always knowing where to go and what to click on or type 23 Keystroke-Level Model  K keystroking/ keypressing  P pointing with a mouse to a target  H homing the hand on the keyboard or mouse  D drawing a line segment on a grid  M mentally preparing for executing physical actions  R response time of the system 2425 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Keystroke-level_model Compare two designs 26https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke-level_model Questions? 27","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
