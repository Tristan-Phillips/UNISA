Access to a computer, the internet, and myUnisa is essential for this module. The module is a practical course. All the information about the course is in this tutorial letter, and on the e-learning portal, myUnisa. Logon to myUnisa as soon as possible and download additional information for this module. You need to purchase your prescribed books. On myUnisa you will find the tool \"Home\". The information is important and guides you through the different tools that are important in this course. This module introduces you to Oracle’s implementation of SQL. The Database Management Systems Software (DBMS) that you are going to use is Oracle 11g XE. You have to download Oracle 11g XE DBMS from the Oracle website. Instructions on how to install Oracle 11g XE DBMS are under “Additional Resources” on myUnisa. This tutorial letter contains important information about the scheme of work, resources and assignments for this module. Read it carefully and keep it at hand when working through the study material; preparing for assignments; preparing for the examination and addressing questions to your lecturers. Tutorial Letter 301 gives you an idea of important general information when studying at a distance at a specific college. All follow-up tutorial letters and communication will be published on myUnisa. We hope that you will enjoy this course! 2 PURPOSE AND OUTCOMES 2.1 Purpose Students who successfully complete this module will be able to design, implement and use database management systems. This module provides fundamentals and the required knowledge, skills and values which will support further studies and applications in the sector of Computer Science and Information systems, in the field of Database Management systems as part of either Bachelor of Science degree in Computing or Informatics or the Bachelor of Commerce degree with Informatics as major. These competencies therefore contribute to the development of competitive information technology practitioners who have strong technical skills of designing, implementing and managing database systems. 2.2 Outcomes Specific outcome 1: Demonstrate knowledge of commercially available DBMS end-user tools 4 Range: • Commercially available DBMS end-user tools • Simple indexes, multi-level indexes, index-sequential files, tree structures Assessment criteria: • Students critically analyse and synthesise the features and limitations of the various DBMS end-user tools • Students demonstrate an informed understanding of the interaction between the tools and the database. • Students can use the tools to create workable solutions to well-defined, but unfamiliar problems. Specific outcome 2: Gather and review the requirements for database access for a computer application, using Structured Query Language (SQL) Range: • The database access requirements include at least four of the following: data sharing, integration, abstraction, data independence, data models, data definition language, data manipulation language and data control language. Assessment criteria: • Students critically analyse the feasibility of the requirement. • Students demonstrate an informed understanding of the database access objectives and critical performance factors. • Students adopt the procedure to ensure that the outcomes meet the database access requirements. Specific outcome 3: Perform testing of programs for a computer application that accesses a database, using SQL. Range: • The test includes access to database and debugging Assessment criteria: • Students check program logical paths; correct program code to eliminate errors identified through testing; and access functions in the required design environment Specific outcome 4: Create program coding for database access for a computer application, using SQL Range: • Types of data access include user-defined types, user-defined routines, reference types, collection types, support for large objects, stored procedures, multiple-joined tables. INF3707/101/3/2017 5 Assessment criteria: • Students code and implement a program according to the program design, using the language constructs to facilitate the understanding of the code, ensuring that the data integrity, accessed by multiple users and processes, is maintained. 3 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 3.1 Lecturer(s) Details for the Primary Lecturer of this module are available in Tutorial letter 301. 3.2 Department Details for the School of Computing are available in Tutorial letter 301. 3.3 University To contact the University, you should follow the instructions in the myStudies @ Unisa brochure.

When doing the assignment; studying the text you have to read; consulting other resources; discussing the work with fellow students or tutors; or doing research, you are actively engaged in learning. Looking at the assessment criteria given for each assignment will help you to get a better idea of what is required of you. Submit the multiple-choice assignments via myUnisa. Do not fax, e-mail or post the assignments directly to the lecturer. For detailed information on and the requirements for the assignments, please refer to the brochure, my Studies @ Unisa. 8.2 Assessment plan Although you may work together when preparing assignments, you must write and submit your own individually prepared assignment. In other words, you must submit your own ideas in your own coding. It is unacceptable to submit copied (a form of plagiarism) assignments on the basis that you have worked together. None of these assignments will be marked. Furthermore, you may be penalised or subjected to disciplinary proceedings by the university. Both Assignment 1 and 2 are compulsory. CALCULATION OF YOUR YEAR MARK, EXAMINATION MARK AND FINAL MARK CALCULATION OF YOUR YEAR MARK Year mark = (Assignment 1 x 50%) + (Assignment 2 x 50%) For general information and requirements as far as assignments are concerned, see the brochure, my Studies @ Unisa. HOW THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM WORKS For general information on and requirements for the examinations, see the brochure, my Studies @ Unisa. EXAMINATION ADMISSION You must submit Assignment 1 on or before the applicable due date to gain admission to the examination. If you do not meet this requirement, you will not be granted examination admission for this module. The marks you receive for the two assignments contribute to your year mark, which counts 20% towards the final mark. The year mark constitutes 20% and the examination mark 80% of the final mark. 8 Final mark = Year mark x 0.2 + Examination mark x 0.8 You must obtain a final mark of 50% or more in order to pass this module. 8.3 Assignment numbers 8.3.1 General assignment numbers Assignments are numbered consecutively per module, starting from 01.
