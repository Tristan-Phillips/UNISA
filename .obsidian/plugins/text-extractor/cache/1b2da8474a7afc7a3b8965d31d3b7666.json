This is a narrowed down Interaction design that is only focussing on computing systems. Similarity Improving interactions. Improving interactions. Differences Focussed on everyday products used by people, like ATM’s, Cell phones, your car radio. Focussed on computing systems only. Lifesum example Improved dieting and the amount of water to drink to get you to your specified goal. The specific interaction between you and the Lifesum mobile app. 1.2 User experience Usability Definition Is defines by the overall look, feel and actual use of the product or service Usability refers to the efficiency of the product. I.e. how quick the specific product can do the job. Main goal The main goal is to get as many clients satisfies with how to look and feel is around the actual product The main goal is to keep the client happy with the actual product’s function and well it performs its function[s]. Similarity The client needs to be satisfied The client needs to be satisfied Difference User experience refers to more around the look and feel Usability refers to the product’s actual functions Lifesum example The app has a lot of animations in the app which makes it quite satisfying to use the app It’s very easy to enter your specific health goals in the app – and it will automatically suggest diets within a blink of a second. INF7320 – ASSIGNMENT 1 STUDENT UNIQUE NUMBER: 766839 Question 2 2.1 Name of ID activity Definition of ID activity How do you plan to implement this activity during the interaction design of the new version of the app? 1.Discover Understanding and gathering the insights of the problem. I will look for flaws within the current app and understand why it is listed under a flaw. 2.Define Discussing possible solutions to resolve the problem. Brainstorming will happen at this activity to resolve the current flaws. 3.Develop Developing the solutions and go through the different phases – create, prototype, test and iterate. This will be where the developers will put their skills at work to get the best possible solution to resolve the flaws, getting beta versions released to involve users. 4.Deliver Releasing the solution into the live environment. This will be where the new version of the app will replace the old version with the flaws. 2.2 I will firstly recognise who is the stakeholders of my product. Meaning, who will be part of the app during the development phase. By recognising the stakeholders I’ll get an understanding what type of user will user will be in the scope for the app. It is important to identify users of the app because that will narrow down where my Lifesum target market must be and where to advertise the application. I.e. at the gyms. 2.3 To determine users’ needs, we will first have to develop and deliver new functions in the beta application. The functions that the users find more satisfied will have to stick as one of the user needs. This is important to accommodate what the users need, because the more users need the certain functions, the more exposure the app will get, which will mean the more clients will be using the application. 2.4 There are many ways to generate alternate designs. One of these ways are by just simply looking at others’ (even the competitors’) designs and get different perspectives from different people regarding the design. This may help to generate alternative designs. It is important to get alternative designs, because when an app releases it gets outdated and users get used to the application, which will then convince them to move to other applications. To generate alternative designs will change the users’ perspective and still keep them motivated and satisfied. INF7320 – ASSIGNMENT 1 STUDENT UNIQUE NUMBER: 766839 2.5 Prototyping the new design and discussing the user’s experience and preferences on the prototype is an excellent way to choose between alternative designs. The users can also provide suggestions for any improvements. All of these discussions get documented and will then be used to compare the alternative designs, which will help on deciding which design are better off. I think it is very important to get the users to experience the new designs, because this will help you to understand what the users need, and also decide on the best possible design the users need be the help of their experiences and feedback. Question 3 3.1 Purpose of conceptual models: Are to fluently define the problem and design space. Core components Discussion of component Application of component 1.Matephors and analogies Providing metaphors and analogies will help to understand the product more. Record fitness activities with heart rate monitors to analyse users’ performance and health better. 2.The concepts Those concepts that people are exposed to while using the product. Will be able to save activities and also to review past activities and check the average heartrate for previous activities. 3.The relationships between concepts Concepts has the same relation to one another. To get the resting heartrate will be monitored in the same way as to get your maximum heartrate. Your max heartrate can be recorded during exercising whereas resting heartrate gets recorded after you wake up in the early morning. 4.The mappings between the concepts Refers to the similarities between the concepts and user experience the product is designed to support or invoke. To get resting heartrate (min heartrate) in the morning and compare it to your resting heart rate when exercising can provide better results in terms of the analysation of a client’s health. 3.2 INF7320 – ASSIGNMENT 1 STUDENT UNIQUE NUMBER: 766839 Question 4 4.1 Face-to-face conversation Co-presence intervention Remote conversation Definition Face-to-face conversation refers to a dialogue-type conversation where the one person asks a question and the other person answers after the question is asked. Conversations that happens remotely with use of physical coordination, awareness, and shareable interfaces. Conversations that happens remotely with the use of audio and video interfaces Benefits Can clearly hear when someone is speaking and can see hand gestures as well as emotions behind the conversation. Easy explicitly share content in a conference without printing or sending presentations to everyone. Can meet people remotely, which means you can join a conference call internationally without flying over to the designated country. Disadvantages People will need to book flights when an internationally conference call has been set up. Not everyone’s internet might be strong enough to receive incoming presentations. Not everyone’s devices are good enough quality to be heard or seen by anyone. Possible use during redesign of Lifesum When interviewing developers who’s going to redesign the app. When showing reports on the performance of the newly designed interface. When creating conferences to discuss possible solutions for the new design. 4.2 Social interaction – refers to how people are interacting with each other while discussing certain topics. Social presence – refers to how and where people are interacting when they are discussing certain topics. 4.3 INF7320 – ASSIGNMENT 1 STUDENT UNIQUE NUMBER: 766839 Question 5 5.1 Design element Annoying interfaces Pleasurable interfaces Visceral design Visceral design refers to making a product look, feel and sound good. An annoying interface in Lifesum is that there are nou sound effects when using the app. Pleasurable interface recommendation for the visceral design element will be to use the suitable sound effects when achieving goals, or even selecting a glass of water for each glass that has been drank. Behavioural/reflective level Behavioural/reflective level design element refers to the actual use of the application. This is determined by each individual itself and what the client likes, and dislikes will have an effect on the app. I do not like when the app cannot keep track of my heartrate during an activity. The pleasurable interface will be to rectify the heartrate activity tracking function to please the needs of some customers.
