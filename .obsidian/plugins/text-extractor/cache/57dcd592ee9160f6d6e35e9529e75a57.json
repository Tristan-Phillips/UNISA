Interaction design means designing interactive products to sup- port the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives. Four basic activities in Interaction Design establishing requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping and evaluating What is usability? Usability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective. Name and discuss the usability goals. [6] 1. Effectiveness - a very general goal referring to how good a product is at doing what it's supposed to do 2. Efficiency - refers to the way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks, e.g. fewer steps to accomplish things 3. Safety - To make interactive products safer in this sense in- volves 1) preventing the user from making serious errors by reducing the risk of wrong keys/buttons being mistakenly activated 2) providing users with various means of recovery should the make errors. Undo functionality. 4. Utility - refers to the extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to. 5. Learnability - refers to how easy a system is to learn and use. 6. Memorability - refers to how easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned. What is user experience User experience is concerned with \"all aspects of the user's ex- perience when interacting with the product, service, environment or facility\". Focused on emotions and feelings of the user when using the product. what are some user experience goals? Desirable aspects: Satisfying Enjoyable Engaging Pleasurable Cognitively stimulating Exciting Entertaining Helpful Motivating Surprising Undesirable aspects: Boring Frustrating Annoying Childish Unpleasant Patronizing Making one feel stupid Explain the role of software design principles Used by interaction designers to aid their thinking when designing for user experience by helping to orient their thinking about differ- ent aspects of their designs. Derived from theory-based knowledge, experience and common sense, and suggest to designers what to provide and what to avoid 1 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 at the interface - the do's and don'ts of interaction design Not intended to specify how to design an actual interface List five design principles that are concerned with how to deter- mine what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product 1. Visibility - The more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know what to do next 2. Feedback - Sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity 3. Constraints - Determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment 4. Consistency - Designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. 5. Affordance - Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it, to 'give a clue'. There are two types of affordance, Perceived and Rea McCarthy and Wright (2004) 4 core threads that make up holistic experiences. 1. Sensual Thread: Concerned with our sensory engagement with a situation. Can involve thrill, fear, pain, comfort, etc. 2. Compositional Thread: Concerned with narrative part of an experience, as it unfolds, and the way a person makes sense of it. The compositional thread is the internal thinking we do during experiences. 3. Emotional Thread: The framework points out how emotions are intertwined with the situation in which they arise. Emotions also involve making judgements of value. 4. Spatio-temporal Thread: Refers to the space and time in which our experiences take place and their effect upon those experience What is a conceptual model? A conceptual model provides a working strategy and a framework of general concepts and their interrelations which describes at a high level how a system is organized and operates. It is used by the design team as the basis from which to develop more detailed and concrete aspects of the design What are the benefits of conceptualizing the design space early on? Orientation - enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the targeted users. Open-mindedness - preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focused early on. Common ground - allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on. Discuss the core components of a conceptual model 1. Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity 2. The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them 2 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 3. The relationships between those concepts (e.g. whether one object contains another and the relative impor- tance of actions to others). 4. The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke The purpose of a conceptual model is to provide a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates; it provides a framework of general concepts and their relationships allowing designers to get a clear understanding of the requirement for starting to code What is an interface metaphor? An interface metaphor is a conceptual model that is instantiated as part of the user interface and is similar in some way to aspects of a physical entity but also has its own behaviors and properties. In which three ways can metaphors and analogies be applied in conceptual design? A way of conceptualizing what we are doing As a conceptual model instantiated at the interface As a way of visualizing an operation Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of metaphors Advantages Interface metaphors are based on conceptual models that com- bine familiar knowledge with new concepts, hence, helps users to easily understand the underlying model. Exploit user's familiar knowledge, helping them to understand the unfamiliar, hence, makes learning newsy stems easier. It is easier to learn and talk about what you are doing on a computer interface in terms of what you familiar to in your daily life. Enables a greater diversity of users to understand computer functionality. Improve users' confidence. Disadvantages Designers sometimes have a misconception; they try to design an interface metaphor to look and behave like the physical entity it is compared with. Breaks conventional and cultural rules. Constrains designers in the way they conceptualize the problem space. Conflict with design principles. Not being able to understand the system functionality beyond the metaphor. Designers can base their designs on existing objects that were badly designed. The imagination of designers to come up with new conceptual models is limited Identify and describe the four types of interaction Instructing This is where a user instructs a system and tells it what to do Conversing This is where users would have a dialog with a system. The system acts as a dialog partner and impersonates a human being. Manipulating This is where users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them. The manipulation is informed by how users manipulate physical objects in real world. Exploring This is where users move through a virtual or a physical environ- ment. Sensors are used in physical environments to enable people to interact with an environment, 3 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 What is a framework? A framework is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area or analytic method Norman's (1998) explication The relationship between the design of a conceptual model and the user's understanding of it The designer's model is the model the designer has of how the system should work. This is how the designer envisions the system working and how he/she intends that users should interact with the system. The system image is how the system actually works, and is portrayed to the user through the interface. The system image should make obvious what a user should do. The users' model represents how the user understands how the system works, which ideally should match with what is presented in the system image and what the designer intended Why is it important that designers consolidate the three compo- nents when designing software? In an ideal world, users should be able to carry out activities in the way intended by the designer by interacting with the system image that makes it obvious what to do. If the three components mentioned above are not consolidated properly, it can lead to a â€¢poor user experience. If the system image does not make the designer's model clear to the users, it is likely that they will end up with an incorrect understanding of the system, which in turn will increase their chances of using the system ineffectively and making errors. By drawing attention to this potential discrepancy, designers can be made aware of the importance of trying to bridge the gap more effectively Paradigm Refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a com- munity of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values and practices Vision Future scenario that frames research and development in inter- action design Theory Well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon Model simplification of some aspect of HCI intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs Framework Set of interrelated concepts and or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area CH4 Summary Human beings are inherently social; people will always need to collaborate, coordinate, and communicate with one another, and the diverse range of applications, web-based services, and technologies that have emerged are enabling them to do so in more extensive and diverse ways. In this chapter we have looked at some core aspects of sociality, -namely communication and collaboration. We examined the main social mechanisms that people use in different conversational settings when interacting face-to-face and at a distance. A number of collaborative and telepresence technologies de- signed to support and extend these mechanisms were discussed, highlighting core interaction design concerns People are used to face-to-face communication which allows not only talking and listening but also taking into account visual clues such as facial expressions. 4 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 Describe how social media have changed the way in which people interact. The telephone overcame distance and time barriers but limited communication to audible signs. Messaging apps allows video calls, video conferencing and tex- ting. These technologies lack the richness of face-to-face communi- cation and people compensate for these constraints by talking louder, using emoticons or projecting themselves more. Social media apps allow one-to-many broadcasting, is immediate and can be on-sided. People switch easily between different technologies depending on the context (texting; emailing; chatting) Messages can easily be sent to the wrong receiver. Reliability of messages can be a problem Telepresence Telepresence technologies project people's body movements, ac- tions, voice and facial expressions to give the appearance that they are present in the meeting. Co-presence Shareable interfaces enable more than one person to use them at the same time to enhance co-located collaboration and gaming Emotional interaction is concerned with how we feel and react when interacting with technology Emotional interaction is about considering what makes us happy, sad, annoyed, anxious, frustrated, moti- vated delirious, and so on and using this knowledge to inform the design of different aspects of the user experience, from when we first want something to when we no longer interact with it or need to replace it Ortony's model of emotion and behavior Highest Level - Reflective Brain processes that contemplate. Entails conscious thoughts where people generalise across events/ step back from routine and the immediate Middle Level -Behavioral The brain processes that control our everyday behavior. Where most human activities occur, e.g. well-learned routine operations such as talking, typing and driving Lowest Level -Visceral Are the parts of the brain that are pre-wired to auto respond to events. Respond rapidly, making judgements about what is good/bad, safe/dangerous, pleasure/abhorrent. It also triggers emotional responses to stimuli that are expressed through a combination of physiological and behavioral responses Expressive interfaces Use expressive forms like emoticons, sounds, icons and virtual agents to convey emotional states or elicit an emotional response in users. For example, a user may feel at ease and reassured that the computer is functioning correctly when seeing a smiling icon on screen while it is booting up 5 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 Dynamic icons and animations can convey further information about the status of a system. Use of imagery such as this can result in a more engaging and enjoyable experience Annoying interfaces When something that should be easy to use turns out to be complex, for example, trying to switch from watching a DVD to the TV. Effort to negate this issue such as friendly agents, can also become annoying Interfaces, if poorly designed, can make people feel stupid, in- sulted or threatened to the point of being annoyed or even losing their temper Persuasive interfaces Draw people's attention to certain kinds of information in an at- tempt to change what they do or think These techniques can also be applied to non-commercial do- mains, such as changing behavior related to health, safety, fitness, personal relationships, energy consumption, and learning Discuss any five reasons that can explain user frustration with using computers. If a system is not effective to use, in that it doesn't do what it's supposed to do or what the user wants it to do. If a system is not efficient to use If a system is not easy to learn If the system is not easy to remember how to use, If the system doesn't provide feedback about current status, or about the results or consequences of user actions, it can become confusing and frustrating. If the interface is generally overloaded with flashing animations, text and graphics, the over-use of sound effects and music and so on, it is not a pleasant user experience Frustration can occur if usability goals, user experience goals and good design princi- ples haven't been given enough attention. Explain what is meant by persuasive technology Technology that is designed in such a way as to influence and change the attitude or behavior of the user by drawing their attention to certain kinds of information Strategies that are employed in designing technologies in order to change people's attitude and behavior include 1. Just in time persuasion 2. Simulating experience 3. Personalizing 4. Recommendation 5. Monitoring and tracking 6. Competition and recognition 7. Visualizing the personalities in virtual communities The study of computers as a persuasive technology is known as Captology Explain the term anthropomorphism Anthropomorphism is attributing human qualities to objects and has been used in interaction design to design applications that have human-like qualities Make people feel inferior or anxious. Studies have shown that personalized feedback is considered to be less honest and makes users feel less responsible for their actions. Lack the ability to follow a conversation and fail to suggest 6 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 anthropomorphism disadvantages appropriate help. Speech recognition systems incorrectly may translate people say. If the technology is targeted for novice users, experts may be- come frustrated. Giving users no control over the system frustrates users. The systems deceive users because they think that computers have all human capabilities, hence they blame them when some- thing goes wrong. Agents cannot give some common examples that are not related to the current problem. What are the five key issues that determine the success of a data gathering exercise? 1. Setting goals The type of information required after gathering the data needs to be clear. What is it that you want to know? Specific goals should be set about what data is required since it will affect the gathering techniques used and the analysis to be performed on the data. 2. Identifying participants The goals that are set will help you identify the kind of people you will need to gather data from. 3. Relationship with participants The relationship between the people doing the gathering and the people providing the data needs to be clear and professional. Typically, participants will sign an informed consent form explain- ing the purpose of the data gathering, how the data will be used, and assurance that they may withdraw at any time. 4. Triangulation This technique is useful for validating the results of some inquiry by using more than one data gathering or data analysis technique to arrive at similar results from different perspectives, thereby confirming, in a way, the results. In practice, this is very difficult to achieve, however. 5. Pilot studies Perform a small trial run of the main study. In doing so, you can make sure that the proposed method is viable before starting the real study. Potential problems can be identified and corrected in advance, making it more likely that the real study will be success- ful. List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the interview The interviewer can take notes and photographs of the interview. Taking notes is the least technical and most flexible way of record- ing data, and photographs of artefacts can be used to supplement notes. The interviewee can be recorded with an audio recording device and photographs can supplement the audio content if required. Audio recording is a good alternative to note taking and less intrusive than video. The interviewee can be recorded on video with a camera. 7 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 May require more than one camera in different locations to capture all that is required Discuss any three disadvantages of taking notes during the inter- view It can be difficult and tiring to write and listen or observe at the same time. It's easier for the interviewer to lose concentration while their focus is on writing or typing rather than on the intervie- wee's thought sand comments. Handwriting can be difficult to decipher after the fact. Speed of writing or typing is limited, and important information may be missed Discuss what should be avoided when designing interview ques- tions The questions should not be ambiguous. Avoid emotional language. Jargon or complex language should be avoided. Avoid leading questions. Avoid bias. Ask question one at a time. Avoid questions that require a response of a simple yes or no answer. Interview questions should follow some order. Do not ask abrupt questions. Avoid questions that are not related to interview goals. The type of data recording should not interfere with the interview proceeding. Name and describe the types of interview methods Unstructured (open-ended) interviews Exploratory and more like conversations No particular expectation about the format or content of answers Structured interviews Predetermined questions, same questions for each participant. Typically closed questions. Useful when the goals are clearly understood Semi-structured interviews Uses both closed and open-ended questions. Basic script for guidance so that same topics are covered for all participants, but question could take different paths based on participants responses and interviewer's probing The best way to ensure that development continues to take users' activities into account is to involve real users throughout development. The importance of involving users Developers can gain a better understanding of users' goals, lead- ing to a more appropriate, more usable product. The purpose of expectation management is to ensure that there are no surprises for users when the product arrives. Involving users throughout development helps with expectation management because they can see from an early stage what the product's capabilities are. Adequate and timely training is another technique for managing expectations 8 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 A reason for user involvement is ownership. Users who are in- volved and feel that they have contributed to a product's develop- ment are more likely to feel a sense of ownership towards it and support its use In a user-centered approach, what are the three principles laid down by Gould and Lewis that they believed would lead to a 'useful and easy to use computer system'? 1. Early focus on users and tasks This means first understanding who the users will be by directly studying their cognitive, behavioral, anthropomorphic, and attitu- dinal characteristics. T his requires observing users doing their normal tasks, studying the nature of those tasks and then involving users in the design process. 2. Empirical measurement Early in development, the reactions and performance of intended users to printed scenarios, manuals, etc., are observed and mea- sured. Later on, users interact with simulations and prototypes and their performance and reactions are observed, recorded, and analyzed. 3. Iterative design When problems are found in user testing, they are fixed and then more tests and observations are carried out to see the effects of the fixes. This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of design-test-measure-redesign being repeated as often as necessary When following a user-centered approach in interactive design, there is a principle of 'focus on users and tasks early'. Name and explain five sub-principles that explain the meaning of the above statement 1. Users' tasks and goals are the driving force behind the de- velopment - In a user-centered approach, technology will inform the design options, but the users' goals will inform the choice that supports them best. 2. Users' behavior and context of use are studied, and the system is designed to support them - How people perform their tasks - understanding their priorities, preferences and intentions - is significant. 3. Users' characteristics are captured and designed for - Products designed for humans should take into account our cognitive (such as attention, memory, perception issues) and physical (height, strength, mobility) limitations. 4. Users are consulted throughout the development process from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account. It's important that users are respected by designers. 5. All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment - This doesn't mean that users make the decisions. As long as designers remain aware of users while making decisions, this principle will be upheld Improved quality of the system arising from a more accurate capture of user requirements, this is because they use the system every day or on daily basis. To avoid incorporation of costly system features that users would not want to use or cannot use. To provide users with a system that meets their real expectations. To ensure that users do not encounter surprises when the new system is delivered. 9 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 What is the importance of involving users during the design of a computer information system? Greater understanding of the system by the users results in more effective use. Users can see from early stages of software development what the capabilities of the system are. If users are involved, they will have chance to work with the prod- uct before it is released, and they will have a better understanding of what to expect on the new system. Increased participation in decision making within software devel- opment cycle increases ownership of the system by the users. Users who were involved feel that they have contributed to a product's development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership Four Basic Activities of Interaction Design Establishing Requirements - Know who target users are and what kind of support an interactive product could usefully provide. These needs form the basis of the product's requirements and under pin sub sequent design and development. Est requirements is fundamental to a user-centered approach and very important in interaction design. Understanding the needs is established through data gathering and analysis. Designing Alternatives - This is the core activity of designing and actually involves suggesting ideas for meeting the requirements. It can be viewed as 2 sub-activities: conceptual and concrete de- sign. Conceptual design involves producing the conceptual model for the product and a conceptual model describes an abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Concrete design considers the detail of the product including the colors, sounds, and images to use, menu design, and icon design. Alternatives are considered at every point. Prototyping - Interaction design involves designing interactive products. Most sensible way for users to evaluate such designs is to interact with it, and this can be achieved through prototyping. Different prototyping techniques exist, but not all require a working piece of software. Evaluating - This is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design that is measured in terms of a variety of usability and user experience criteria. Interaction design requires a high level of user involvement throughout devel- opment, and this enhances the chances of an acceptable product being delivered. Evaluation does not replace the activities con- cerned with quality assurance and testing to make sure that the final product is fit for purpose, but it complements and enhances then Briefly discuss how you would involve users during the design of a computer information system As a member of the design team: Full time: constant input, but lose touch with other users. Part time: patchy input, can be very stressful. Short term: inconsistent across project life. Long term: consistent, but lose touch with users. Via newsletters and other dissemination devices: Can reach wider selection of users. Need communication both ways. User involvement after product is released. Combination of these approaches. How many types of requirements are there? There are two different kinds of requirements. Functional and Non-functional Functional requirements capture what products can do. Non-functional requirements say what constraints there are on the system and its development 10 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 Data Requirements Capture type, volatility, size/amount, accuracy and value of re- quired data Environmental Requirements: Refer to circumstances in what the interactive product will operate There are four aspects of environmental requirements that must be considered when establishing requirements. 1. Physical Environment: such as how much lighting, noise, move- ment, and dust is expected in operational environment. 2. Social Environment: e.g. collaboration and coordination to be expected. 3. Organizational Environment, e.g. how good is the user support likely to be, and how easily can it be obtained. 4. Technical Environment to be established User Characteristics: capture the key attributes of intended user group and the abilities and skills. Usability goals and user experience goals These are another kind of requirement, and should be captured together with appropriate measures. Usability should be given due priority and can facilitate progress tracking The overall purpose of data gathering in the requirements activity is to collect sufficient, relevant, and appropriate data so that a set of stable requirements can be produced. Data gathering needs to cover a wide spectrum of issues: The tasks that users currently perform and their associated goals, the context in which the task are performed, and the rationale for the current situation Interviews Are good for exploring issues, and semi-structured or unstruc- tured interviews are often use dearly on to elicit scenarios. Equally important for development team members to meet stakeholders and for users to feel involved Focus Groups: Are good for gaining a consensus view and highlighting areas of conflict and disagreement during the requirements activity Questionnaires: May be used for getting initial responses that can then be ana- lyzed to choose people to interview or get a wider perspective on particular issues that have arisen elsewhere Direct Observation In the requirements activity, observation of participants in their natural setting is used to understand the nature of the tasks and the context in which they are performed Indirect Observation Diaries and interaction logging are used less often within the requirements activity where a new product is under development Studying Documentation Manuals and other documentation are a good source of data about the steps involved in an activity and any regulations gov- erning a task Data gathering Guidelines 1. Focus on identifying the stakeholders' needs. 2. Involve all the stakeholder groups 3. Involving only one representative from each stakeholder group is not enough, especially if the group is large. 4. Support the data gathering session with suitable props, such as task descriptions and prototypes if available Brainstorming for innovation For requirements, two key success factors are firstly that the participants should know the users' goals that the product is to support, and secondly that no ideas should be criticized or debated 1. Include participants from a wide range of disciplines, with a broad range of experience; 11 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 Brainstorming 2. Don't ban silly stuff. Wild ideas often turn into really useful requirements; 3. Use catalysts for further inspiration. Build one idea on top of another; 4. Keep records. Every idea should be captured without censoring; 5. Sharpen the focus. Start the brainstorm with a well-honed problem; 6. Use warm-up exercises and make the session fun. The group will require warming up if they have not worked together before Task Analysis Is used mainly to investigate an existing situation, not to envision new products It is used to analyze the underlying rationale and purpose of what people are doing Hierarchical Task Analysis [HTA] Involves breaking a task down into subtasks and then into sub-sub-tasks and so on. There are two main problems with using HTA on real problems 1. Real tasks are very complex, and task analysis does not scale very well. 2. Task analysis is limited in the kinds of task it can model. E.g. it cannot model tasks that are overlapping, or in parallel, nor can it model interruptions. Benefits of task analysis include 1. It lets you objectively compare alternative designs, based on a user's planned tasks and subtasks. 2. It provides a good understanding of the interaction at whichever level of abstraction is appropriate. This facilitates good design. 3. It supports design reuse - again at different levels of abstraction Conceptual design is concerned with transforming requirements into a conceptual model A conceptual model is an outline of what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it Interface metaphors Combine familiar knowledge with new knowledge in a way that will help a user understand the product Erickson (1990) suggest a three step process for choosing a good interface metaphor 1. Understand what the system will do, i.e. identifying the function- al requirements. 2. Understand which bits of the product are likely to cause users problems, i.e. which tasks or subtasks cause problems, are com- plicated or are critical. 3. Generate metaphors. Looking for metaphors in the users' de- scription of the tasks is good starting point Describe the three broad categories of evaluation 1. Controlled settings involving users. Users' activities are con- trolled in order to test hypotheses and measure or observe certain behaviors. **The main methods are usability testing and experiments. 2. Natural settings involving users - There is little or no control of users' activities in order to determine how the product would be used in the real world. **The main method used is field studies. 12 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 3. Any settings not involving users - consultants and researchers' critique, predict, and model aspects of the interface in order to identify the most obvious usability problems. The range of meth- ods includes inspections, heuristics, walkthroughs, models, and analytics Usability Testing The goal is to test whether the product being developed is usable by the intended user Types of Evaluation 1. Controlled settings involving users 2. Natural settings involving users 3. Any settings not involving users Usability Testing The goal is to test whether the product being developed is usable by the intended user population to achieve the tasks for which it was designed. Usability testing takes place in usability labs or temporary makeshift labs. These labs enable evaluators to control the test setting. Usability testing focuses on performance measures such as as how long and how many errors are made, when completing a set of predefined tasks. Indirect observation is conducted and supplemented by user sat- isfaction questionnaires and interviews Field studies are evaluation studies that are carried out in natural settings. They aim to discover how people interact with technology in the real world. What is heuristic evaluation? Heuristic evaluation is an informal usability inspection technique developed by Nielsen and his colleagues in which experts, guid- ed by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure or online help conform to the principles 1. Visibility of system status - The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feed- back within reasonable time. 2. Match between system and the real world - The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 3. User control and freedom - Users often choose system func- tions by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog. Support undo and redo. 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. 5. Error prevention - Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. 13 / 14 INF3720 - Key Notes Study online at https://quizlet.com/_bz2sg2 What is Jakob Nielsen's original set of heuristics for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) evaluation? 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialog to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators - unseen by the novice user - may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogs should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialog competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), pre- cisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. Nielsen suggests developing category specific heuristics. Con- sider the following design guidelines and for each suggest a question that could be used in heuristics evaluation. Good graphical design is important. Reading long sentences and paragraphs is difficult on the screen, so break material into dis- crete, meaningful chunks to give the website a structure. Avoid excessive use of color. Color is useful for indicating different kinds of information. Avoid excessive use of graphics. Download time for smartphone applications must be short. Schneiderman's eight golden rules are used as heuristics for identifying usability problems. List the rules and briefly describe 14 / 14","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
