(4) Answer (Preece, Rogers, Sharp, 4th ed., Chapter 1, p. 25-30/5th ed., Chapter 1, p. 26-30):  Visibility: the controls for operations should be clearly visible and findable = Findability: the degree to which a particular object is easy to discover or locate   Feedback: products should give adequate feedback/send information about what action(s) has already been done/what has been accomplished so that a user knows that to do next in the interface/proceed (audio/tactile/verbal/visual)   Constraints: ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction/interpration that can take place at a given moment   Consistency: interfaces that have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks   Affordance: an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it (intuitively) (virtual or real)  = Navigability: is it obvious what to do and where to go in an interface?  Max. 4 1.3 Identify and describe five of the goals of usability briefly.

Metaphors and analogies ½ A figure of speech/comparison that convey to people to understand what a software product is used for and how it should be used ½ The new version of the LSHED app must use a herald (analogy/metaphor), i.e. it must have an easier, user- friendly way to inform users when the next load shedding will take place.  8 MEMO INF3720 S1 ASSIGNMENT 1 2020  2. Concepts to which people are exposed through the proposed product ½ Task-domain objects which users create and manipulate, their attributes, and possible operations. ½ E.g. an option/button to show a herald and make a trumpet sound whenever a new notification is pushed to the user’s phone.  3. Relationships between those concepts ½ For instance, whether one object contains another ½ When the user clicks or taps on the herald, linked neighbours are informed too.  4. Mappings between the concepts and the UX the product is designed support or invoke ½ For instance, revisiting a page through looking at a list of visited sites, most-frequently visited, or saved websites ½ The user can easily browse to a daily schedule of all eight possible load shedding phases for the area where he/she currently is/will be (linking current location, day and time with schedules and phases per area) – thus providing a user- friendly and effective interface and a positive UX. This solves users’ need to when load shedding will occur in order to plan their daily activities around it.   MARKSALLOWEDFORANYFEASIBLE,GRAPHICALCONCEPTMAP–SEEEXAMPLESONTHEINTERNET(GOOGLE), E.G.: 9 MEMO INF3720 S1 ASSIGNMENT 1 2020    THE INFORMATION IN THE FIGURE SHOULD BE RELATED TO THE LSHED APPLICATION/WEBSITE 10 MEMO INF3720 S1 ASSIGNMENT 1 2020  Question 4 – Chapter 5 (10) Discuss remote conversations (telepresence) and co-presence as areas where computer-based tools and services support people who ca a meeting or social gathering.
