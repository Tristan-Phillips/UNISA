Below we outline a brief history of interaction design. In the early days, engineers designed hardware systems for engineers to use. The computer interface was relatively straightforward, comprising various switch panels and dials that controlled a set of internal registers. With the advent of moni- tors (then referred to as visual display units or 8 Chapter 1 What is interaction design?

It also refers to the perceived fears users might have of the con- sequences of making errors and how this affects their behavior. To make computer-based systems safer in this sense involves (i) preventing the user from making serious errors by reducing the risk of wrong keyslbuttons being mistakenly activated (an example is not placing the quit or delete-file command right next to the save command on a menu) and (ii) providing users with various means of re- covery should they make errors. Safe interactive systems should engender confi- dence and allow the user the opportunity to explore the interface to try out new operations (see Figure 16 Chapter 1 What is interaction design? confirmatory dialog boxes that give users another chance to consider their inten- tions (a well-known example used in e-mail applications is the appearance of a dia- log box, after the user has highlighted messages to be deleted, saying: \"Are you sure you want to delete all these messages?\" See Figure 1.5 The goals of interaction design 17 accomplish. A key concern is determining how much time users are prepared to spend learning a system. There seems little point in developing a range of function- ality if the majority of users are unable or not prepared to spend time learning how to use it. Question: How easy is it and how long does it take (i) to get started using a sys- tem to perform core tasks and (ii) to learn the range of operations to perform a wider set of tasks? Memorability refers to how easy a system is to remember how to use, once learned. This is especially important for interactive systems that are used infre- quently. If users haven't used a system or an operation for a few months or longer, they should be able to remember or at least rapidly be reminded how to use it. Users shouldn't have to keep relearning how to carry out tasks. Unfortunately, this tends to happen when the operations required to be learned are obscure, illogical, or poorly sequenced. Users need to be helped to remember how to do tasks. There are many ways of designing the interaction to support this. For example, users can be helped to remember the sequence of operations at different stages of a task through meaningful icons, command names, and menu options. Also, structuring options and icons so they are placed in relevant categories of options 1 8 Chapter 1.5 The goals of interaction design 19 The goals of designing interactive products to be fun, enjoyable, pleasurable, aesthetically pleasing and so on are concerned primarily with the user experience. By this we mean what the interaction with the system feels like to the users. This in- volves explicating the nature of the user experience in subjective terms. For exam- ple, a new software package for children to create their own music may be designed with the primary objectives of being fun and entertaining. Hence, user experience goals differ from the more objective usability goals in that they are concerned with how users experience an interactive product from their perspective, rather than as- sessing how useful or productive a system is from its own perspective. The relation- ship between the two is shown in Figure 1.7. Much of the work on enjoyment, fun, etc., has been carried out in the enter- tainment and computer games industry, which has a vested interest in understand- ing the role of pleasure in considerable detail. Aspects that have been described as contributing to pleasure include: attention, pace, play, interactivity, conscious and unconscious control, engagement, and style of narrative. It has even been suggested that in these contexts, it might be interesting to build systems that are non-easy to use, providing opportunities for quite different user experiences from those designed based on usability goals (Frohlich and Murphy, 1999). Interact- ing with a virtual representation using a physical device 20 Chapter 1.6 More on usability: 22 Chapter 1.6 More on usability: design and usability principles 23 Figure 1.9 (a) Natural mapping between rewind, play, and fast forward on a tape recorder device. (b) An alternative arbitrary mapping. trigger something else to happen. Making actions and their effects obvious enables people to logically deduce what further actions are required. Disabling menu op- tions when not appropriate for the task in hand provides logical constraining. 24 Chapter 1.6 More on usability: 26 Chapter 1 What is interaction design? interfaces are better conceptualized as perceived affordances, which are essentially learned conventions. In conclusion, Norman argues that other design concepts--con- ventions, feedback and cultural and logical constraints- are far more useful for help- ing designers develop graphical user interfaces. 1.6.1 Heuristics and usability principles When design principles are used in practice they are commonly referred to as heuristics. This term emphasizes that something has to be done with them when they are applied to a given problem. In particular, they need to be interpreted in the design context, drawing on past experience of, for example, how to design feed- back and what it means for something to be consistent. Another form of guidance is usability principles. An example is \"speak the user's language.\" These are quite similar to design principles, except that they tend to be more prescriptive. In addition, whereas design principles tend to be used mainly for informing a design, usability principles are used mostly as the basis for evaluating prototypes and existing systems. In particular, they provide the framework for heuris- tic evaluation (see Chapter 13). They, too, are called heuristics when used as part of 1.6 More on usability: 28 Chapter 30 Chapter Interview 31 32 Chapter Interview Chapter 36 Chapter 2.2 Understanding the problem space 37 how? In the above example, this involves finding out what is problematic with ex- isting forms of navigating while driving 38 Chapter 2.3 Conceptual models 39 Comment The problem space for this scenario was very open-ended. There was no identifiable problem that needed to be improved or fixed. Alternatively, the new WAP technology provided op- portunities to create new facilities and experiences for people. One of the main assumptions is that people want to be kept informed of up-to-the-minute news 2.3 Conceptual models 41 There are a number of different kinds of conceptual models. These can be bro- ken down into two main categories: those based on activities and those based on objects. 2.3.1 Conceptual models based on activities The most 42 Chapter 2.3 Conceptual models 43 Figure 2.3 Two vending machines, (a) one selling soft drinks, (b) the other selling a range of snacks. misreading the code and or mistyping in the code, resulting in the machine not issuing the snack or providing the wrong sort. A better way of designing an interface for a large number of choices of variable cost is to continue to use direct mapping, but use buttons that show miniature versions of the snacks placed in a large matrix (rather than showing actual versions). This would use the available space at the front of the vending machine more economically. The customer would need only to press the button of the object chosen and put in the correct amount of money. Much research has been carried out on how to optimize command-based and other instruction-giving systems with respect to usabilty goals. The form of the commands 2.3 Conceptual models 45 You asked: How many legs does a 46 Chapter 2.3 Conceptual models 47 they are likely to be less forgiving of it (having been fooled into thinking the dialog partner is more intelligent than it really is) than of a dialog partner that is repre- sented as a cartoon character at the interface (having only assumed it was a simple partner). The flip side of imbuing dialog partners with a physical presence at the in- terface, however, is that they can turn out to be rather annoying (for more on this topic see Chapter 5). 3. Manipulating and navigating This conceptual model describes the activity of manipulating objects and navigat- ing through virtual spaces by exploiting users' knowledge of how they do this in the physical world. For example, virtual objects can be manipulated by moving, select- ing, opening, closing, and zooming in and out of them. Extensions to these actions can also be included, such as manipulating objects or navigating through virtual Chapter Figure 2.5 Original Macintosh desktop interface. their assumptions was that people expect their physical actions to have physical results, so when a drawing tool is used, a corresponding line should appear and when a file is placed in the trash can a corresponding sound or visual cue show- ing it has been successfully thrown away is used (Apple Computer Inc., 1987). A number of specific visual and auditory cues were used to provide such feedback, including various animations and sounds 2.3 Conceptual models 49 fied of dragging the icon of their floppy disk to the trash can icon on the desktop to eject it from the computer for fear of deleting it in the same way files are when placed in the trash can. The conceptual confusion arises because the designers opted to use the same action (dropping) on the same object (trash can) for two completely different operations, deleting and ejecting. Another problem is that not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be done directly. Some tasks are better achieved through issuing instructions and having textual descrip- tions rather than iconic representations. Imagine if 50 Chapter 2 Understanding and conceptualizing interaction 2.3 Conceptual models 51 Which conceptual model or combination of models do you think is most suited to supporting the following user activities? (a) downloading music off the web (b) programming Comment (a) The activity involves selecting, saving, cataloging and retrieving large files from an external source. Users need to be able to browse and listen to samples of the music and then instruct the machine to save and catalog the files in an order that they can readily access at subsequent times. A conceptual model based on instructing and navigating would seem appropriate. (b) Programming involves various activities including checking, debugging, copying li- braries, editing, testing, and annotating. An environment that supports this range of tasks needs to be flexible. A conceptual model that allows visualization and easy ma- nipulation of code plus efficient instructing of the system on how to check, debug, copy, etc., is essential. 2.3.2 Conceptual models based on 52 Chapter 2 Understanding and conceptualizing interaction Entry Type V 2.3 Conceptual models 53 number of forecasts- greatly extending what they could do before with existing tools.

As we have pointed out, which kind of conceptual model is optimal for a given ap- plication obviously depends on the nature of the activity to be supported. Some are clearly suited to supporting a given activity 2.4 Interface metaphors 55 The down side of mixing interaction 2.4 Interface 58 Chapter 2.4 Interface metaphors 59 60 Chapter 2 Understanding and conceptualizing interaction amine a web browser interface and describe the various forms of analogy and composite erface metaphors that have been used in its design.

The late Mark Weiser 2.5 Interaction paradigms 63 communication presented many opportunities for thinking about how to embed such technologies on people in the clothes they wear. Jewelry, head-mounted caps, glasses, shoes, and jackets have all been experimented with to provide the user with a means of interacting with digital information while on the move in the physical world. Applications that have been developed include automatic diaries that keep users up to date on what is happening and what they need to do throughout the day, and tour guides that inform users of relevant information as they walk through an exhibition and other public places (Rhodes et al., 1999). Tangible bits, augmented reality, and physicaUvirtua1 integration. Another de- velopment that has evolved from ubiquitous computing is tangible user interfaces or tangible bits (Ishii and Ullmer, 1997). The focus of this paradigm is the \"integra- tion of computational augmentations into the physical environment\", in other words, finding ways to combine digital information with physical objects and sur- faces 64 Chapter 2 Understanding and conceptualizing interaction The Workaday World. In the new paradigms mentioned above, the emphasis is on exploring how technological devices can be linked with each other and digital information in novel ways that allow people to do things they could not do before. In contrast, the Workaday World paradigm is driven primarily by conceptual and mundane concerns. It was proposed by Tom Moran and Bob Anderson 2.6 From conceptual 66 Chapter 2.6 From conceptual models to physical design 67 68 Chapter References 69 Key points It is important to have a good understanding of the problem space, specifying what it is you are doing, why and how it will support users in the way intended. A fundamental aspect of interaction design is to develop a conceptual model. There are various kinds of conceptual models that are categorized according to the activ- ity or object they are based on. Interaction modes 70 Chapter Interview 71 exposure. It is not the kind of thing you can set down easily as, say, you can scientific formulas. A lot of design tends to be methodological. It is not about the design per se but is more about how you go about doing design, in particular, knowing what are the appropriate steps to take and how you put them together. YR: How do you see the field of interaction design taking on board the current explosion in new tech- nologies- for example mobile, ubiquitous, infrared, and so on? Is it different, say, from 20 years ago when it was just about designing software applications to sit on the desktop? Chapter 74 Chapter 3.2 What is cognition? 75 Cognition has also been described in terms of specific kinds of processes. These include: attention perception and recognition memory learning reading, speaking, and listening problem solving, planning, reasoning, decision making It is important to note that many of these cognitive processes are interdepen- dent: several may be involved for a given activity. For example, when you try to learn material for an exam, you need to attend to the material, perceive, and recog- nize it, read it, think about it, and try to remember it. Thus, cognition typically in- volves a range of processes. It is rare for one to occur in isolation. Below we describe the various kinds in more detail, followed by a summary box highlighting core design implications for each. Most relevant (and most thoroughly researched) for interaction design is memory, which we describe in greatest detail. Attention is the process of selecting things to concentrate on, at a point in time, from the range of possibilities available. Attention involves our auditory 76 Chapter 3.2 What is cognition? 77 most dominant sense for sighted individuals, followed by hearing and touch. With respect to interaction design, it is important to present information in a way that can be readily perceived in the manner intended. For example, there are many ways to design icons. The key is to make them easily distinguishable from one an- other and to make it simple to recognize what they are intended to represent (not like the ones in Figure 3.4). Combinations of different media need also to be designed to allow users to rec- ognize the composite information represented in them in the way intended. The use of sound and animation together needs to be coordinated so they happen in a logical sequence. An example of this is the design of lip-synch applications, where the animation of an avatar's or agent's face to make it appear to be talking, must be carefully synchronized with the speech that is emitted. A slight delay between the two can make it difficult and disturbing to perceive what is happening- as some- times happens when film dubbing gets out of synch. A general design principle is 78 Chapter 3.2 What is cognition? 79 forget things we would dearly love to remember and conversely remember things we would love to forget. For example, we may find it difficult to remember every- day things like people's names and phone numbers or academic knowledge like mathematical formulae. On the other hand, we may effortlessly remember trivia or tunes that cycle endlessly through our heads. How does this filtering process work? Initially, encoding takes place, determin- ing which information is attended to in the environment and how it is interpreted. The extent to which it takes place affects our ability to recall that information later. The more attention that is paid to something and the more it is processed in terms of thinking about it and comparing it with other knowledge, the more likely it is to be remembered. For example, when learning about a topic it is much better to re- flect upon it, carry out exercises, have discussions with others about it, and write notes than just passively read a book or watch a video about it. Thus, how informa- tion is interpreted when it is encountered greatly affects how it is represented in memory and how it is used later. Another factor that affects the extent to which information can be subse- quently retrieved is the context in which it is encoded. One outcome is that some- times it can be difficult for people to recall information that was encoded in a different context from the one they currently are in. Consider the following sce- nario: You are on a train and someone comes up to you and says hello. You don't recognize him for a few moments but then realize it is one of your neighbors. You are only used to seeing your neighbor in the hallway of your apartment block and seeing him out of context makes him 80 Chapter 3 Understanding users users can browse through until they recognize the operation they want to perform (see Figure 3.2 What is cognition? 81 File Folder -- 82 Chapter 3.2 What is cognition? 83 years. He suggests that it is profitable to view this process as involving two memory processes: recall-directed, followed by recognition-based scanning. The first refers to using memorized information about the required file to get as close to it as possi- ble. The more exact this is, the more success the user will have in tracking down the desired file. The second happens when recall has failed to produce what a user wants and so requires reading through directories of files. To illustrate the difference between these two processes, consider the following scenario: a user is trying to access a couple of 84 Chapter 3.2 What is cognition? 85 How else might banks solve the problem of providing a secure system while making the memory load relatively easy for people wanting to use phone banking? How does phone banking compare with online banking? Comment An alternative approach is to provide the customers with a PIN number (it could be the same as that of their ATM card) and ask them to key this in on their phone keypad, followed by asking one or two questions like their zip or post code, as a backup. Online banking has similar security risks to phone banking and hence this requires a number of security mea- sures to be enforced. These include that the user sets up a nickname and a password. For ex- ample, some banks require typing in three randomly selected letters from a password each time the user logs on. This is harder to do online than when asked over the phone, mainly 86 Chapter 3.2 What is cognition? 87 sentences or phrases is the same regardless of the mode in which it is conveyed. For example, the sentence \"Computers are a wonderful invention\" essentially has the same meaning whether one reads it, speaks it, or hears it. However, the ease with which people can read, listen, or speak differs depending on the person, task, and context. For example, many people find listening much easier than reading. Specific differences between the three modes include: Written language is permanent while listening is transient. It is possible to reread information if not understood the first time round. This is not possi- ble with spoken information that is 88 Chapter 3 Understanding users Reading can be quicker than speaking or listening, as written text can be rapidly scanned in ways not possible when listening to serially presented spo- ken words. Listening requires less cognitive effort than reading or speaking.

Another ap- proach is to apply theories and conceptual frameworks to interaction design. In this section we examine three of these approaches, which each have a different perspec- tive on cognition: mental models information processing external cognition 3.4.1 Mental models In Chapter 2 we pointed out that a successful system is one based on a conceptual model that enables users to readily learn a system and use it effectively. What hap- pens when people are learning and using a system is that they develop knowledge of how to use the system and, to a lesser extent, how the system works. These two kinds of knowledge are often referred to as a user's mental model. Having developed a mental model of an interactive product, it is assumed that people will use it to make inferences about how to carry out tasks when using the interactive product. Mental models are also used to fathom what to do when some- thing unexpected happens with a system and when encountering unfamiliar sys- tems. The more someone learns about a system and how it functions, the more their mental model develops. For example, TV engineers have a \"deep\" mental model of how 3.4 Conceptual frameworks for cognition 93 an average citizen is likely to have a reasonably good mental model of how to oper- ate a TV but a \"shallow\" mental model of how it works. Within cognitive psychology, mental models have been postulated as internal constructions of some aspect of the external world that are manipulated enabling predictions and inferences to be made (Craik, 1943). This process is thought to in- volve the \"fleshing out\" and the \" running\" of a mental model (Johnson-Laird, 1983). This can involve both unconscious and conscious mental processes, where images and analogies are activated. o illustrate how we use mental models in our everyday reasoning, imagine the following (a) You arrive home from a holiday on a cold winter's night to a cold house. You have a small baby and you need to get the house warm as quickly as possible. Your house is centrally heated. Do you set the thermostat as high as possible or turn it to the de- sired temperature I 94 Chapter 3.4 Conceptual frameworks for cognition 95 barn iAe 96 Chapter 3 Understanding users 3.4.2 information processing Another approach to conceptualizing how the mind works has been to use metaphors and analogies (see also Chapter 2). A number of comparisons have been made, including conceptualizing the mind as a reservoir, a telephone net- work, and a digital computer. One prevalent metaphor from cognitive psychology is the idea that the mind is an information processor. Information is thought to enter and exit the mind through a series of ordered processing stages (see Figure 3.11). Within these stages, various processes are assumed to act upon mental rep- resentations. Processes include comparing and matching. Mental representations are assumed to comprise images, mental models, rules, and other forms of knowl- edge. The information processing model provides a basis from which to make predic- tions about human performance. Hypotheses can be made about how long some- one will take to perceive and respond to a stimulus (also known as reaction time) and what bottlenecks occur if a person is overloaded with too much information. The best known approach is the human processor model, which models the cogni- tive processes of a user interacting with a computer (Card et al., 1983). Based on the information processing model, cognition is conceptualized as a series of pro- cessing stages, where perceptual, cognitive, and motor processors are organized in relation to one another (see Figure 3.12). The model predicts which cognitive processes are involved when a user interacts with a computer, enabling calculations to be made of how long a user will take to carry out various tasks. This can be very useful when comparing different interfaces. For example, it has been used to com- pare how well different word processors support a range of editing tasks. The information processing approach is based on modeling mental activities that happen exclusively inside the head. However, most cognitive activities involve people interacting with external kinds of representations, like books, documents, and computers- not to mention one another. For example, when we go home from wherever we have been we do not need to remember the details of the route be- cause we rely on cues in the environment 3.4 Conceptual frameworks for cognition 97 pw,,\" = 7 15-91 chunks 98 Chapter 3.4 Conceptual frameworks for cognition 99 reminding them of what to do 100 102 Chapter Summary 103 Assignment The aim of this assignment is for you to elicit mental models from people. 104 Chapter Chapter 106 Chapter 4 Design for collaboration and communication The main aims of this chapter are to: 4.2 Social mechanisms in communication and collaboration 107 4.2.1 Conversational mechanisms Talking is something that is effortless and comes naturally to most people. And yet holding a conversation is a highly skilled collaborative achievement, having many of the qualities of a musical ensemble. Below we examine what makes up a conver- sation. We begin by examining what happens at the beginning: A: Hi there. B: Hi! C: Hi. A: All right? C: Good. How's it going? A: Fine, how are you? C: Good. B: OK. How's life treating you? Such mutual greetings are typical. A dialog may then ensue in which the partic- ipants take turns asking questions, giving replies, and making statements. Then when one or more of the participants wants to draw the conversation to a close, they do so by using either implicit or explicit cues. An example of an implicit cue is when a participant looks at his watch, signaling indirectly to the other participants that he wants the conversation to draw to a close. The other participants may choose to acknowledge this cue or carry on and ignore it. Either way, the first par- ticipant may then offer an explicit signal, by saying, \"Well, I must be off now. Got work to 108 Chapter 4 Design for collaboration and communication someone else taking part in the conversation may take up the opportunity and offer a view on the matter. If this does not happen then the third rule is applied and the current speaker continues talking. The rules are cycled through recursively until someone speaks again. To facilitate rule following, people use various ways of indicating how long they are going to talk and on what topic. For example, a speaker might say right at the beginning of their turn in the conversation that he has three things to say. A speaker may also explicitly request a change in speaker by saying, \"OK, that's all I want to say on that matter. So, what do you think?\" to a listener. More subtle cues to let others know that their turn in the conversation is coming to an end include the lowering or raising of the voice to indicate the end of a question or the use of phrases like, \"You know what I mean?\" or simply, \"OK?\" Back channeling 4.2 Social mechanisms in communication and collaboration 109 such situations the participants will collaborate to overcome the misunderstanding by using repair mechanisms.

In addition to monitoring the behaviors of others, people will organize their work and physical environment to enable it to be successfully monitored by others. This ranges from the use of subtle cues to more blatant ones. An example of a sub- tle cue is when someone leaves their dorm or office door slightly ajar to indicate that they can be approached. A more blatant one is the complete closing of their door together with a \"do not disturb\" notice prominently on it, signaling to every- one that under no circumstances should they be disturbed (see Figure 4.9). Overhearing and overseeing People who work closely together also develop various strategies for coordinating their work, based on an up-to-date awareness of what the others are doing. This is especially so for interdependent tasks, where the outcome of one person's activity is needed for others to be able to carry out their tasks. For example, when putting on a show, the performers will constantly monitor what one another is doing in order to coordinate their performance efficiently. The metaphorical expression \"closely-knit teams\" exemplifies this way of col- laborating. People become highly skilled in reading and tracking what others are doing and the information they are attending to. A well-known study of this phe- nomenon is described by Christian Heath and Paul Luff 126 4.2 Social mechanisms in communication and collaboration 127 Figure 4.10 A screen dump of Portholes, showing 128 Chapter 4 Design for collaboration and communication Figure 4.3 ~thno~ra~hic studies of collaboration and communication 1 29 4.3 Ethnographic studies of collaboration and communication One of the main approaches to informing the design of collaborative technolo- gies that takes into account social concerns is carrying out an ethnographic study (a type of field study). Observations of the setting, be it home, work, school, pub- lic place, or other setting, are made, examining the current work and other col- laborative practices people engage in. The way existing technologies and everyday artifacts are used is also analyzed. The outcome of such studies can be very illuminating, revealing how people currently manage in their work and everyday environments. They also provide a basis from which to consider how such existing settings might be improved or enhanced through the introduction of new technologies, and can also expose problematic assumptions about how collaborative technologies will or should be used in a setting (for more on how to use ethnography to inform design, see Chapter 9; how to do ethnography is cov- ered in Chapter 12). Many studies have analyzed in detail how people carry out their work in differ- ent settings (Plowman et al., 1995). The findings of these studies are used both to inform the design of a specific system, intended for a particular workplace, and more generally, to provide input into the design of new technologies. They can also highlight problems with existing system design methods. For example, an early study by Lucy 130 Chapter 4 Design for collaboration and communication 4.4 Conceptual frameworks A number of conceptual frameworks of the \"social\" have been adapted from other disciplines, like sociology and anthropology. As with the conceptual frameworks derived from cognitive approaches, the aim has been to provide analytic frame- works and concepts that are more amenable to design concerns. Below, we briefly describe two well known approaches, that have quite distinct origins and ways of informing interaction design. These are: Languagelaction framework Distributed cognition The first describes how a model of the way people communicate was used to in- form the design of a collaborative technology. The second describes a theory that is used primarily to analyze how people carry out their work, using a variety of technologies. 4.4.1 The language/action framework The basic premise of the language/action framework is that people act through lan- guage (Winograd and Flores, 1986). It was developed to inform the design of sys- tems to help people work more effectively through improving the way they communicate with one another. It is based on various theories of how people use language in their everyday activities, most notably speech act theory. Speech act theory is concerned with the functions utterances have in conversa- tions (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969). A common function is a request that is asked indi- rectly (known as an indirect speech act). For example, when someone says, \"It's hot in here\" they may really be asking if it would be OK to open the window because they need some fresh air. Speech acts range from formalized statements 4.4 Conceptual frameworks 1 3 1 A: Declare - 4.4 Conceptual frameworks 133 texts, the system failed because it was asking too much of the users to change the way they communicated and worked. However, it should be noted that the Coordi- nator was successful in other kinds of organizations, namely those that are highly structured and need a highly structured system to support them. In particular, the most successful use of the Coordinator and its successors has been in organizations, like large manufacturing divisions of companies, where there is a great need for considerable management of orders and where previous support has been mainly in the form of a hodgepodge of paper forms and inflexible task-specific data pro- cessing applications (Winograd, 1994). 1 4.4.2 Distributed cognition In the previous chapter we described how traditional approaches to modeling cog- nition have focussed on what goes on inside one person's head. We also mentioned that there has been considerable dissatisfaction with this approach, as it ignores how people interact with one another and their use of artifacts and external repre- sentations in their everyday and working activities. To redress this situation, Ed 134 Chapter 4 Design for collaboration and communication 4.4 Conceptual Frameworks 135 through different media (over the radio, through the co-pilot, and via a change in the position of an instrument). A distributed cognition analysis typically involves examining: the distributed problem solving that takes place (including the way people work together to solve a problem) the role of verbal and non-verbal behavior (including what is said, what is implied by glances, winks, etc., and what is not said) the various coordinating mechanisms that are used 136 Chapter 4 Design Further reading 137 Summary In this chapter we have looked at some core aspects of sociality, namely communication and collaboration. We examined the main social mechanisms that people use in different settings in order to collaborate. A number of collaborative technologies have been designed to sup- port and extend these mechanisms. We looked at representative examples of these, high- lighting core interaction design concerns. A particular concern is social acceptability that is critical for the success or failure of technologies intended to be used by groups of people working or communicating together. We also discussed how ethnographic studies and theo- retical frameworks can play a valuable role when designing new technologies for work and other settings. Key points Social aspects are the actions and interactions that people engage in at home, work, school, and in public. The three main kinds of social mechanism used to coordinate and facilitate social aspects are conversation, coordination, and awareness. Talk and the way it is managed is integral to coordinating social activities. Many kinds of computer-mediated communication systems have been developed to en- able people to communicate with one another when in physically different locations. External representations, rules, conventions, verbal and non-verbal communication are all used to coordinate activities among people. It is important to take into account the social protocols people use in face to face collabo- ration when designing collaborative technologies. Keeping aware of what others are doing and letting others know what you are doing are important aspects of collaborative working and socializing. Ethnographic studies and conceptual frameworks play an important role in understand- ing the social issues to be taken into account in designing collaborative systems. Getting the right level of control between users and system is critical when designing col- laborative systems.

YR: And what about cognitive aspects, such as how people carry out their tasks, what they remember, what they are bad at remembering? Is that also im- portant to look into when you are doing these kinds of studies? AS: Yes, if you think about evaluation studies, then cognitive aspects are extremely important. Looking at cognitive aspects can help you understand the nature of the user interaction, in particular what processes are going on in their heads. This includes issues like learning how users perceive a device and how they form a mental model of how something works. Cogni- tive issues are especially important to consider when we want to contrast one device with another or think about new and better ways in which we might design an interface. YR: I wonder if you could describe to me briefly one of your recent studies where you have looked at cog- nitive and social aspects. AS: How about a recent study we did to do with building devices for reading digital documents? When we first set out on this study, before we could begin to think about how to build such devices, we had to begin by asking, \"What do we mean by reading?\" It turned out there was not a lot written about the dif- ferent ways people read in their day-to-day lives. So the first thing we did was a very broad study looking at how people read in work situations. The technique we used here was a combination of asking people to fill out a diary about their reading activities during the course of a day and interviewing them at the end of each day. The interviews were based around what was written in the diaries, which turned out to be a good way of unpacking more details about what people had been doing. That initial study allowed us to categorize all the different ways people were reading. What we found out is that actually you can't talk about reading in a generic sense but that it falls into at least 10 different categories. For example, sometimes people skim read, sometimes they read for the purpose of writing something, and sometimes they read very reflectively and deeply, marking up their documents as they go. What quickly emerged from this first study was that if you're designing a device for reading it might look very different depending on the kind of reading the users are doing. So, for example, if they're reading by themselves, the screen size and viewing angle may not be as important as if they're reading with others. If they're skim reading, the ability to quickly flick through pages is important. And if they're reading and writing, then this points to the need for a 140 Chapter 4 Design for collaboration and communication for a smaller organization such as a start-up Understanding how interfaces affect users 5.1 Introduction 5.2 What are affective aspects? 5.3 Expressive interfaces 5.4 User frustration 5.5 A debate: the application of anthropomorphism to interaction design 5.6 Virtual characters: agents 5.6.1 Kinds of agents 5.6.2 General design concerns: believability of virtual characters 5.1 Introduction An overarching goal of interaction design is to develop interactive systems that elicit positive responses from users, such as feeling at ease, being comfortable, and enjoying the experience of using them. More recently, designers have become in- terested in how to design interactive products that elicit specific kinds of emotional responses in users, motivating them to learn, play, be creative, and be social. There is also a growing concern with how to design 142 Chapter 5.3 Expressive interfaces 144 Chapter 2 146 5.4 User frustration 147 Table 5.1 Some commonly used emoticons.

The effect of requesting an animated agent to become very happy, sad, or grumpy is seen through changes to their behavior, For example, if a user moves a slider to a \"scared\" position on an emotional scale, the agent starts behaving scared, hiding behind objects and mak- ing frightened facial expressions. The Woggles are one of the earliest forms of emotional agents (Bates, 1994). A group of agents was designed to appear on the screen that played games with one another, such as hide and seek. They were designed as different colored bouncy balls with cute facial expressions. Users could change their moods 160 Chapter 5.6 Virtual characters: agents 1 61 Figure 5.1 4 Two versions of Phil, the agent assistant that appeared in Apple's promo- tional video called the Knowledge Navigator (a) as a real actor pretending to be a computer agent and (b) as a cartoon being an agent.

In one version, he was played by a real actor that appeared on a university professor's computer screen. Thus, he was portrayed as an artificial agent but was played by a real human. The actor was a smartly dressed assistant wearing a white shirt and bow tie. He was also extremely polite. He per- formed a number of simple tasks at the computer interface, such as reminding the professor of his appointments for that day and alerting him to phone calls waiting. Many people found this version of Phil unrealistic. After viewing the promotional video, people complained about him, saying that he seemed too stupid. 162 Chapter Further reading 163 (b) Next, look at an e-commerce 164 Chapter Chapter 6 The process of interaction design 6.1 Introduction 6.2 What is interaction design about? 6.2.1 Four basic activities of interaction design 6.2.2 Three key characteristics of the interaction design process 6.3 Some practical issues 6.3.1 Who are the users? 6.3.2 What do we mean 166 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design were introduced in Chapter 1. We also introduce a lifecycle model of interaction design that captures these activities and characteristics. The main aims of this chapter are to: Consider what 'doing' interaction design involves. Ask and provide answers for some important questions about the interaction design process. Introduce the idea of a lifecycle model to represent a set of activities and how they are related. Describe some lifecycle models from software engineering and HCI and dis- cuss how they relate to the process of interaction design. Present a lifecycle model of interaction design. 6.2 What is interaction design about? There are many fields of design, for example graphic design, architectural design, industrial and software design. Each discipline has its own interpretation of \"de- signing.\" We are not going to debate these different interpretations here, as we are focussing on interaction design, but a general definition of \"design\" is informative in beginning to understand what it's about. The definition of design from the Ox- ford English Dictionary captures the essence of design very well: \"(design is) a plan or scheme conceived in the mind and intended for subsequent execution.\" The act of designing therefore involves the development of such a plan or scheme. For the plan or scheme to have a hope of ultimate execution, it has to be informed with knowledge about its use and the target domain, together with practical constraints such as materials, cost, and feasibility. For example, if we conceived of a plan for building multi-level roads in order to overcome traffic congestion, before the plan could be executed we would have to consider drivers' attitudes to using such a con- struction, the viability of the structure, engineering constraints affecting its feasibil- ity, and cost concerns. In interaction design, we investigate the artifact's use and target domain by taking a user-centered 6.2 What is interaction design about? 167 I design. For example, Danis and Boies (2000) found that using techniques from graphic design that encouraged the generation of alternative designs stimulated in- novative interactive systems design. See also the interview with Gillian 168 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design link to address book 6.2 What is interaction design about? 169 sign. During this time, prototypes may be built or perspectives may be drawn to give clients a better indication of the design being developed. Detail design speci- fies all components, and working drawings are produced. Finally, the job arrives on site and building commences. We will be expanding on each of the basic activities of interaction design in the next two chapters. Here we give only a brief introduction to each. Identifying needs and establishing requirements In order to design something to support people, we must know who our target users are and what kind of support an interactive product could usefully provide. These needs form the basis of the product's requirements and underpin subsequent design and development. This activity is fundamental to a user-centered approach, and is very important in interaction design; it is discussed further in Chapter 7. Developing alternative designs This is the core activity of designing: actually suggesting ideas for meeting the re- quirements. This activity can be broken up into two sub-activities: conceptual design and physical design. Conceptual design involves producing the conceptual model for the 170 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design I quality assurance and testing to make sure that the final product is \"fit-for-purpose.\" Evaluation does not replace these activities, but complements and enhances them. We devote Chapters 10 through 14 to the important subject of evaluation. The activities of developing alternative designs, building interactive versions of the design, and evaluation are intertwined: alternatives are evaluated through the interactive versions of the designs and the results are fed back into further design. This iteration is one of the key characteristics of the interaction design process, which we introduced in Chapter 1. 6.2.2 Three key characteristics of the interaction design process 6.3 Some practical issues 1 71 6.3.1 Who are the users? In Chapter 1, we said that an overarching objective of interaction design is to opti- mize the interactions people have with computer-based products, and that this re- quires us to support needs, match wants, and extend capabilities. We also stated above that the activity of identifying these needs and establishing requirements was fundamental to interaction design. However, we can't hope to get very far with this intent until we know who the users are and what they want to achieve. As a starting point, therefore, we need to know who we consult to find out the users' require- ments and needs. Identifying the users may seem like a straightforward activity, but in fact there are many interpretations of \"user.\" The most obvious definition is those people who interact directly with the product to achieve a task. Most people would agree with this definition; however, there are others who can also be thought of as users. For example, Holtzblatt and Jones (1993) include in their definition of \"users\" those who manage direct users, those who receive products from the system, those who test the system, those who make the purchasing de- cision, and those who use competitive products. Eason (1987) identifies three categories of user: primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary users are those likely to be frequent hands-on users of the system; secondary users are occa- sional users or those who use the system through an intermediary; and tertiary users are those affected by the introduction of the system or who will influence its purchase. The trouble is that there is a surprisingly wide collection of people who all have a stake in the development of a successful product. These people are called stakeholders. Stakeholders are \"people or organizations who will be affected by the system and who have a direct or indirect influence on the system require- ments\" (Kotonya and Sommerville, 1998). Dix et al. (1993) make an observation that is very pertinent to a user-centered view of development, that \"It will fre- quently be the case that the formal 'client' who orders the system falls very low on the list of those affected. Be very wary of changes which take power, influ- ence or control from some stakeholders without returning something tangible in its place.\" Generally speaking, the group of stakeholders for a particular product is going to be larger than the group of people you'd normally think of as users, al- though it will of course include users. Based on the definition above, we can see that the group of stakeholders includes the development team itself as well as its managers, the direct users and their managers, recipients of the product's out- put, people who may lose their jobs because of the introduction of the new prod- uct, and so on. For example, consider again the calendar system in Activity 172 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design This last point may seem a little exaggerated for just one system, but if you think of others also migrating to an electronic version, and abandoning their paper cal- endars, then you can see how the companies may be affected by the introduction of the system. The net of stakeholders is really quite wide! We do not suggest that you need to involve all of the stakeholders in your user-centered approach, but it is impor- tant to be aware of the wider impact of any product you are developing. Identifying the stakeholders for your project means that you can make an informed decision about who should be involved and to what degree. Who do you think are the stakeholders for the check-out system of a large supermarket? Comment First, there are the check-out operators. These are the people who sit in front of the machine and pass the customers' purchases over the bar code reader, receive payment, hand over re- ceipts, etc. Their stake in the success and usability of the system is fairly clear and direct. Then you have the customers, who want the system to work properly so that they are charged the right amount for the goods, receive the correct receipt, are 6.3 Some practical issues I 174 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design 6.3.3 How do you generate alternative designs? A common human tendency is to stick with something that we know works. We probably recognize that a better solution may exist out there somewhere, but it's very easy to accept this one because we know it works- it's \"good enough.\" Set- tling for a solution that is good enough is not, in itself, necessarily \"bad,\" but it may be undesirable because good alternatives may never be considered, and considering alternative solutions is a crucial step in the process of design. But where do these alternative ideas come from? One answer to this question is that they come from the individual designer's flair and creativity. While it is certainly true that some people are able to produce wonderfully inspired designs while others struggle to come up with any ideas at all, very little in this world is completely new. Normally, innovations arise through cross-fertilization of ideas from different applications, the evolution of an existing product through use and observation, or straightforward copying of other, similar products. For example, if you think of something commonly believed to be an \"in- vention,\" such as the steam engine, this was in fact inspired by the observation that the steam from a kettle boiling on the stove lifted the lid. Clearly there was an I amount of creativity and engineering involved in making the jump from a boiling kettle to a steam engine, but the kettle provided the inspiration to translate 6.3 Some practical issues 1 75 So although creativity and invention are often wrapped in mystique, we do un- derstand something of the process and of how creativity can be enhanced or in- spired. We know, for instance, that browsing a collection of designs will inspire designers to consider alternative perspectives, and hence alternative solutions. The field of case-based reasoning 176 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design 1 6.3 Some - - - 6.3 Some practical issues I 180 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design power outlets will be dependent on how the wiring within the building is designed and the capacity of the main power supply; the choice of materials used in a pho- tocopier may depend on its friction rating and how much it deforms under certain conditions. In an interactive product there are similar factors that are externally visible and measurable and those that are hidden from the users' view. For example, ex- actly why the response time for a query to a database (or a web page) is, say, 4 sec- onds will almost certainly depend on technical decisions made when the database was constructed, but from the users' viewpoint the important observation is the fact that it does take 4 seconds to respond. In interaction design, the way in which the users interact with the product is considered the driving force behind the design and so we concentrate on the exter- nally visible and measurable behavior. Detailed internal workings are important only to the extent that they affect the external behavior. This 6.3 Some practical issues 181 a web page, then you are likely to give up and try a different site- you are apply- ing a certain measure of quality associated with the time taken to download the web page. If one cell phone makes it easy to perform a critical function while an- other involves several complicated key sequences, then you are likely to buy the former rather than the latter. You are applying a quality criterion concerned with efficiency. Now, if you are the only user of a product, then you don't necessarily have to express your definition of \"quality\" since you don't have to communicate it to anyone else. However, as we have seen, most projects involve many different stakeholder groups, and you will find that each of them has a different definition of quality and different acceptable limits for it. For example, although all stake- holders may agree on targets such as \"response time will be fast\" or \"the menu structure will be easy to use,\" exactly what each of them means by this is likely to vary. Disputes are inevitable when, later in development, it transpires that \"fast\" to one set of stakeholders meant \"under a second,\" while to another it meant \"between 2 and 3 seconds.\" Capturing these different views in clear un- ambiguous language early in development takes you halfway to producing a product that will be regarded as \"good\" by all your stakeholders. It helps to clar- ify expectations, provides a benchmark against which products of the develop- ment process can be measured, and gives you a basis on which to choose among alternatives. The process of writing down formal, verifiable- and hence measurable- usability criteria is a key characteristic of an approach to interaction design called usability en- gineering that has emerged over many years and with various proponents (Whiteside 182 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design et al., 1988; Nielsen, 1993). Usability engineering involves specifying quantifiable measures of product performance, documenting them in a usability specification, and assessing the product against them. One way in which this approach is used is to make changes to subsequent versions of a system based on feedback from carefully documented results of usability tests for the earlier version. We shall return to this idea later when we discuss evaluation. Consider the calendar system that you designed in Activity 6.1. Suggest some usability crite- ria that you could use to determine the calendar's quality. You will find it helpful to think in terms of the usability goals introduced in Chapter 1: effectiveness, efficiency, safety, utility, learnability, and memorability. Be as specific as possible. Check your criteria by considering exactly what you would measure and how you would measure its performance. Having done that, try to do the same thing for the user experience goals introduced in Chapter 1; these relate to whether a system is satisfying, enjoyable, motivating, rewarding, and so on. Comment Finding measurable characteristics for some of these is not easy. Here are some suggestions, but you may have found others. Note that the criteria must be measurable and very specific. Effectiveness: Identifying measurable criteria for this goal is particularly difficult since it is a combination of the other goals. For example, does the system support you in keeping appointments, taking notes, and so on. In other words, is the calendar used? 6.4 184 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design 6.4 6.4 188 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design design can begin. The names given to these steps varies, as does the precise defi- nition of each one, but basically, the lifecycle starts with some requirements analysis, moves into design, then coding, then implementation, testing, and fi- nally maintenance. One of the main flaws with this approach is that require- ments change over time, as businesses and the environment in which they operate change rapidly. This means that it does not make sense to freeze re- quirements for months, or maybe years, while the design and implementation are completed. Some feedback to earlier stages was acknowledged as desirable and indeed practical soon after this lifecycle became widely used (Figure 6.8 does show some limited feedback between phases). But the idea of iteration was not embedded in the waterfall's philosophy. Some level of iteration is now incorporated in most ver- sions of the waterfall, and review sessions among developers are commonplace. However, the opportunity to review and evaluate with users was not built into this model. The spiral 6.4 190 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design JAD (Joint Application Development) workshops in which users and devel- opers come together to thrash out the requirements of the system (Wood and Silver, 1995). These are intensive requirements-gathering sessions in which difficult issues are faced and decisions are made. Representatives from each identified stakeholder group should be involved in each workshop so that all the relevant views can be heard.

Our version models a return to the activity of identifying needs and establishing requirements after evaluating any element of the design. Assignment Nowadays, timepieces (such as clocks, wristwatches etc) have a variety of functions. They not only tell the time and date but they can speak to you, remind you when it's time to do some- thing, and provide a light in the dark, among other things. Mostly, the interface for these de- vices, however, shows the time in one of two basic ways: as a digital number such as Further reading 1 97 Key characteristics of the interaction design process are explicit incorporation of user in- volvement, iteration, and specific usability criteria. Before you can begin to establish requirements, you must understand who the users are and what their goals are in using the device. Looking at others' designs provides useful inspiration and encourages designers to con- sider alternative design solutions, which is key to effective design. Usability criteria, technical feasibility, and users' feedback on prototypes can all be used to choose among alternatives. Prototyping is a useful technique for facilitating user feedback on designs at all stages. Lifecycle models show how development activities relate to one another. The interaction design process is complementary to lifecycle models from other fields. Further reading RUDISILL, M., LEWIS, C., 198 Chapter 6 The process of interaction design Department, developing a program to enable artist-designers to develop and ence between the way engineers are trained and the way designers are trained is that engineers are trained to focus in on a solution from the beginning whereas designers are trained to focus out to begin with and then focus in. They focus out and try lots of different alternatives, and they pick some and try them out to see how they go. Then they refine down. This is very hard for both the engineers and the designers because the designers are thinking the engineers are trying to hone in much too quickly and the engineers can't bear the designers faffing about. They are trained to get their results in a completely different way. HS: Is your idea to make each more tolerant of the other?

As an alternative or as corroboration, it can be very re- vealing to get a group of stakeholders together to discuss issues and requirements. These sessions can be very structured with set topics for discussion, or can be un- structured.

Such documentation should not be used as the only source, however, as everyday practices may augment them and may have been devised by those concerned to make the procedures work in a practical setting. Taking a user-centered view of development means that we are interested in the everyday practices rather than an idealized account. Other documentation that might be studied includes diaries or job logs that are written by the stakeholders during the course of their work. In the requirements activity, studying documentation is good for understanding legislation and getting some background information on the work. It also doesn't in- volve stakeholder time, which is a limiting factor on the other techniques. 7.4.2 Choosing between techniques 1 21 6 Chapter 7.4 Data gathering 21 7 such as a competitor's product or an earlier release of your product under development. Involve all the stakeholder groups. It is very important to make sure that you get all the views of the right people. This may seem an obvious com- ment, but it is easy to overlook certain sections of the stakeholder popula- tion if you're not careful. We were told about one case where a large distribution and logistics company reimplemented their software systems and were very careful to involve all the clerical, managerial, and warehouse staff in their development process, but on the day the system went live, the productivity of the operation fell by 50%. On investigation it was found that the bottleneck was not in their own company, but in the suppliers' ware- houses that had to interact with the new system. No one had asked them how they worked, and the new system was incompatible with their working routines. Involving only one representative from each stakeholder group is not enough, especially if the group is large. Everyone you involve in data gather- ing will have their own perspective on the situation, the task, their job and how others interact with them. If you only involve one representative stake- holder then you will only get a narrow view. Use a combination of data gathering techniques. Each technique will yield a certain kind of information, from a certain perspective. Using different tech- niques is one way of making sure that you get different perspectives (called triangulation, see Chapter lo), and corroboration of findings. For example, use observation to understand the context of task performance, interviews to target specific user groups, questionnaires to reach a wider population, and focus groups to build a consensus view. Support the data-gathering sessions with suitable props, such as task descrip- tions and prototypes if available. Since the requirements activity is iterative, prototypes or descriptions generated during one session may be reused or revisited in another with the same or a different set of stakeholders. Using props will help to jog people's memories and act as a focus for discussions. Run a pilot session if possible to ensure that your data-gathering session is likely to go as planned. This is particularly important for questionnaires where there is no one to help the users with ambiguities or other difficulties, but also applies to interview questions, workshop formats, and props. Any data collected during pilot sessions cannot be treated equally with other data, so don't mix them up. After running the pilot it is likely that some changes will be needed before running the session \"for real.\" In an ideal world, you would understand what you are looking for and what kinds of analysis you want to do, and design the data-capture exercise to col- lect the data you want. However, data gathering is an expensive and 21 8 Chapter 7 Identifying needs and establishing requirements situation, but before you can make sensible compromises, you need to know what you'd really like. How you record the data during a face-to-face data-gathering session is just as important as the technique(s) you use. Video recording, audio recording, and note taking are the main options. Video and audio recording provide the most accurate record of the session, but they can generate huge amounts of data. You also need to decide on practical issues that can have profound effects on the data collected, such as where to position the camera. Note tak- ing can be harder unless this is the person's only role in the session, but note taking always involves an element of interpretation. Taking impartial, accu- rate notes is difficult but can be improved with practice. For each of the situations below, consider what kinds of data gathering would be appropri- ate and how you might use the different techniques introduced above. You should assume that you are at the beginning of the development and that you have sufficient time and re- sources to use any of the techniques. (a) You are developing a new software system to support a small accountant's office. There is a system running already with which the users are reasonably happy, but it is looking dated and needs upgrading. (b) You are looking to develop an innovative device for diabetes sufferers to help them record and monitor their blood sugar levels. There are some products already on the market, but they tend to be large and unwieldy. Many diabetes sufferers rely on man- ual recording and monitoring methods involving a ritual with a needle, some chemi- cals, and a written scale. (c) You are developing a 7.5 Data interpretation and 220 Chapter 7.5 Data interpretation and analysis 221 state charts, work-flow charts, etc. (see 222 Chapter 7.6 Task description 223 university library, and allows you to access the details of books held in the library: for example, to search for books by a particular author, or by subject, to identify the location of a book you want to borrow, and to check on a member's current loans and status. The shared calendar application is to support a university department. Mem- bers of the department currently keep their own calendars and communicate their whereabouts to the department's administrator, who keeps the information in a central paper calendar. Unfortunately, the central calendar and the individuals' cal- endars easily become out of step as members of the department arrange their own engagements. It is hoped that having a shared calendar in which individuals can enter their own engagements will help overcome the confusion that often ensues due to this mismatch. Shared calendars raise some interesting aspects of collabora- tion and coordination, as discussed in Chapter 4, Box 4.2. In particular, people don't usually like to have their time filled with appointments without their consent, and so a mechanism is needed for people to protect some time from being booked by others. 224 Chapter 7.6 Task description 225 A businesswoman 226 Chapter 7.6 Task description 227 228 Chapter 7.6 Task description 229 Consider the example of the library catalog service again. One use case is \"Locate book,\" and this would be associated with the \"Library member\" actor. Identify one other main actor and an associated use case, and draw a use case diagram. Write out the use case for \"Locate book\" including the normal and some alterna- tive courses. You may assume that the normal course is for users to go to the catalog to find the location, and that the most common path to find this is through a search by author. Comment One other main actor is the \"Librarian.\" A use case for the \"Librarian\" would be \"Update catalog.\" Figure 7.9 is the associated use case diagram. There are other use cases you may have identified.

Think of more complex tasks such as scheduling delivery trucks, or organizing a large conference. Comment Real tasks are very complex. One of the main problems with task analysis is that it does not scale very well. The notation soon becomes unwieldy, making it difficult to follow. Imagine what it would be like to produce a task analysis in which there were hundreds or even thou- sands of Further reading 235 to carry out these techniques is covered in Chapters 12 through 14, Scenarios, use cases, and essential use cases are helpful techniques for beginning to document the findings from the data-gathering sessions. Task analysis is a little more structured, but does not scale well. Key points Getting the requirements right is crucial to the success of the interactive product. There are different kinds of requirements: functional, data, environmental, user, and us- ability. Every system will have requirements under each of these headings. The most commonly used data-gathering techniques for this activity are: questionnaires, in- terviews, workshops or focus groups, naturalistic observation, and studying documentation. Descriptions of user tasks such as scenarios, use cases, and essential use cases help users to articulate existing work practices. They also help to express envisioned use for new devices. Task analysis techniques help to investigate existing systems and current practices. Further reading ROBERTSON, SUZANNE, AND ROBERTSON, JAMES (1999) Mas- tering the Requirements Process.

Sometimes these conflicts resolve lution ideas, and when you get a solution idea, pop it themselves because they're on people's back burners, in this drawer. This helps requirements engineers, I and some of the conflicts are resolved by people just think, because we are trained to think of solutions, talking to one another.

There are two distinct circumstances for design: one where you're starting from scratch and one where you're modifying an existing product. A lot of design comes from the latter, and it may be tempting to think that additional features can be added, or existing ones tweaked, without extensive investigation, prototyping or evaluation. It is true that if changes are not significant then the prototyping and evaluation activities can be scaled down, but they are still invaluable activities that should not be skipped. In Chapter 7, we discussed some ways to identify user needs and establish re- quirements. In this chapter, we look at the activities involved in progressing a set of requirements through the cycles of prototyping to construction. We begin by ex- plaining the role and techniques of prototyping and then explain how prototypes may be used in the design process. Tool support plays an important part in devel- opment, but tool support changes so rapidly in this area that we do not attempt to provide a catalog of current support. Instead, we discuss the kinds of tools that may be of help and categories of tools that have been suggested. I The main aims of this chapter are to: Describe prototyping and different types of prototyping activities. Enable you to produce a simple prototype. Enable you to produce a conceptual model for a system and justify your choices. Enable you to attempt some aspects of physical design. Explain the use of scenarios and prototypes in conceptual design. Discuss standards, guidelines, and rules available to help interaction designers. Discuss the range of tool support available for interaction design. 8.2 Prototyping and construction It is often said that users can't tell you what they want, but when they see some- thing and get to use it, they soon know what they don't want. Having collected in- formation about work practices and views about what a system should and shouldn't do, we then need to try out our ideas by building prototypes and iterat- ing through several versions. And the more iterations, the better the final product will be. 8.2 Protoiyping and construction 241 242 Chapter 8 Design, prototyping and construction 4 inches 8.2 Prototyping and construction 243 8.2.3 Low-fidelity protoiyping A low-fidelity prototype is one that does not look very much like the final product. For example, it uses materials that are very different from the intended final ver- sion, such as paper and cardboard rather than electronic screens and metal. The lump of wood used to prototype the Palm Pilot described above is a low-fidelity prototype, as is the cardboard-box laser printer. Low-fidelity prototypes are useful because they tend to be simple, cheap, and quick to produce. This also means that they are simple, cheap, and quick to modify so they support the exploration of alternative designs and ideas.
