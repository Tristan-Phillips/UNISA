Chapter 1 Chapter 1: What is Interaction Design? Objectives The main aims of this chapter are to:  Explain the difference between good and poor interaction design.  Describe what interaction design is and how it relates to human- computer interaction and other fields.  Explain the relationship between the user experience and usability.  Explain the concepts of accessibility and inclusiveness in relation to HCI.  Describe what and who is involved in the process of interaction design.  Outline the different forms of guidance used in interaction design.  Enable you to evaluate an interactive product and explain what is good and bad about it in terms of the goals and core principles of interaction design.

Slides: http://www.id-book.com/slides-5ed.html 7 11 Chapter 11: Discovering Requirements Objectives The main aims of this chapter are to:  Describe different kinds of requirements.  Enable you to identify different kinds of requirements from a simple description.  Explain additional data gathering techniques and how they may be used to discover requirements.  Enable you to develop a persona and a scenario from a simple description.  Describe use cases a way to capture interaction in detail. Slides: http://www.id-book.com/slides-5ed.html 10 14 Chapter 14: Introducing Evaluation Objectives The main aims of this chapter are to:  Explain the key concepts and terms used in evaluation.  Introduce a range of different types of evaluation methods.  Show how different evaluation methods are used for different purposes at different stages of the design process and in different contexts of use.  Show how evaluation methods are mixed and modified to meet the demands of evaluating novel systems.  Discuss some of the practical challenges of doing evaluation.  Illustrate through short case studies how methods discussed in more depth in Chapters 8–10 are used in evaluation and describe some methods that are specific to evaluation.  Provide an overview of methods that are discussed in detail in the next two chapters.
