Why is important to understand the problem space before attempting the design of an interactive system? [1] 2. Succinctly explain conversing as conceptual model activity: [1] 3. What is meant by Storyboarding of designing a conceptual model of a system. [1] 4. Formulating a conceptual model is a process. What steps make up this process? [1] 5 Why is a conceptual model important and crucial for the success of an interactive design project? [1] Long questions (5) 1. With regard to conceptual models based on activities, Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) identify four major activities that users are likely to be engaged in when interacting with a system. Identify those and briefly explain each with an illustration [20] 2. Conceptual models are principally categorized according to the activity or object they are based on. Differentiate these two categories with examples. [20] 3. Identify the benefits and potential problems with interface metaphors [20] 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Direct manipulation as a conceptual design activity? [20] 5. After the analysis of various conceptual models, in your opinion which one is the best? [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. There are many practical benefits to thoroughly understanding the problem space. The first one is That this can highlight problematic concerns. In so doing, it can identify ideas that need to be reworked, before it becomes too late in the design process to make changes. Having a good understanding of the problem space can also help greatly in formulating what it is you want to design. Another key aspect of conceptualizing the problem space is to think about the overall structure of what will be built and how this will be conveyed to the users. In particular, this involves developing a conceptual model. 2. Conversing: It is an underlying model of having a conversation with another human. It ranges from simple voice recognition menu driven systems to more complex ‘natural language’ dialogs. Examples include timetables, search engines, advice-giving systems, help systems. Also virtual agents, toys and pet robots designed to converse with users. 3. As a method to design a conceptual model, storyboarding consists in representing of how the system will function, screen by screen much like shots of a video. Typically a number of squares with illustrations or pictures representing screen/shot, with notes about what's going on in the screen. 4. Steps in formulating a conceptual model include: - What will the users be doing when carrying out their tasks? - How will the system support these? • -What kind of interface metaphor, if any, will be appropriate? - What kinds of interaction modes and styles to use? always keep in mind when making design decisions how the user will understand the underlying conceptual model 5. A conceptual model is: a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates”. It enables – designers of interactive products and systems to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets. This not only minimize errors but it also makes the process of designing more manageable. Answers long questions (5) 1. The most common types of activities identified by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) are: 1. instructing: This kind of conceptual model describes how users carry out their tasks through instructing the system what to do. Examples include giving instructions to a system to perform operations like tell the time, print a file, and remind the user of an appointment. 2. conversing: This conceptual model is based on the idea of a person conversing with a system, where the system acts as a dialog partner. Examples include advisory systems, help facilities, and search engines. The proposed tourist application described earlier would fit into this category. 3. manipulating and navigating: This conceptual model describes the activity of manipulating objects and navigating through virtual spaces by exploiting users' knowledge of how they do this in the physical world. For example, virtual objects can be manipulated by moving, selecting, opening, closing, and zooming in and out of them. 4. exploring and browsing: This conceptual model consists in allowing people to explore and browse information, exploiting their knowledge of how they do this with existing media (e.g., books, magazines, TV, radio, libraries, pamphlets, brochures). 2. The first category of conceptual models based on activities prototype systems to design based on activities or functions that they per including instructing, conversing with, manipulating and navigating or exploring and browsing the system. While the second category of conceptual models is based on an object or artifact, such as a tool, a book, or a vehicle. These tend to be more specific than conceptual models based on activities, focusing on the way a particular object is used in a particular context. They are often based on an analogy with something in the physical world. An example of a conceptual model based on an object is the Accounting systems that mimic manual bookkeeping systems with pen and account books. 3. Benefits of interface metaphors - Makes learning new systems easier - Helps users understand the underlying conceptual model - Can be very innovative and enable the realm of computers and their applications to be made more accessible to a greater diversity of users Problems with interface metaphors: - Break conventional and cultural rules – e.g. recycle bin placed on desktop - Can constrain designers in the way they conceptualize a problem space - Conflict with design principles - Forces users to only understand the system in terms of the metaphor - Designers can inadvertently use bad existing designs and transfer the bad parts over - Limits designers’ imagination in coming up with new conceptual models 4. Advantages of Direct Manipulation: - Novices can learn the basic functionality quickly - Experienced users can work extremely rapidly to carry out a wide range of tasks, even defining new functions - Intermittent users can retain operational concepts over time - -Error messages rarely needed - Users can immediately see if their actions are furthering their goals and if not do something else - Users experience less anxiety - Users gain confidence and mastery and feel in control 1 Disadvantages of Direct Manipulation - Some people take the metaphor of direct manipulation too literally - Not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be done directly - Some tasks are better achieved through delegating – e.g. spell checking - Can become screen space ‘gobblers’ - Moving a mouse around the screen can be slower than pressing function keys to do same actions 5. [here the answer of each student should be properly analyzed] After the analysis of various conceptual models we came to the following conclusion: Direct manipulation is good for ‘doing’ types of tasks, e.g. designing, drawing, flying, driving, sizing windows. Issuing instructions is good for repetitive tasks, e.g. spell-checking, file management. Having a conversation is good for children, computer-phobic, disabled users and specialized applications (e.g. phone services). Hybrid conceptual models are often employed, where different ways of carrying out the same actions is supported at the interface - but can take longer to learn","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
