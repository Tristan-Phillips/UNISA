In response to this charter, we have also placed curriculum transformation high on the agenda. For your information, curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both the programme and module levels, as a phased-in approach. You will notice the implementation thereof in your modules, and we encourage you to fully embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa. 1. INTRODUCTION TO THE MODULE Dear Student Welcome to the Databases II (INF3703) module. We trust that you will find it interesting and rewarding. We shall do our best to make your study of this module successful. We recommend that you start studying early in the semester and that you resolve to do all the assignments and self-assessments as early as possible – and not at the last minute just before the assignment due dates. The assignments play a crucial role in preparing you for the final examination, which is the deciding factor in whether you will successfully pass the module or whether you will have to repeat the module. This module is currently being offered online. Only a few or no tutorial letters will be sent to you. Tutorial letters will be uploaded for you on myUnisa for easy and quick access. We shall therefore primarily use myUnisa for facilitating your learning and for supporting your final examination preparations. It is therefore important that you pay attention to all the announcements sent to you and the various self-assessments that will be posted on myUnisa. We urge you to read all the material available for this module and to ask when in doubt, either via the myUnisa discussion forums or via e-mail. Please refer to this tutorial letter and the learning units on myUnisa when working through the study material, preparing assignment(s), preparing for the examination and addressing questions to your lecturers. This tutorial letter provides all the information you need about the prescribed study material and other resources for this module. Please study this information carefully and make sure that you obtain the prescribed material as soon as possible. Take note of the preliminary examination dates and arrange for leave with your employer in good time if you are working full time. We hope that you will enjoy this module and wish you all the best. INF3703/101/3/2020 5 PLEASE NOTE THIS MODULE IS OFFERED ONLINE, THUS LIMITED TO NO PRINTED MATERIAL WILL BE SENT TO STUDENTS. myUnisa IS THE PRIMARY MEDIUM FOR ALL INTERACTION BETWEEN THE LECTURER AND STUDENTS. ALL TUTORIAL LETTERS, ASSIGNMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS AND STUDY GUIDES CAN BE FOUND ON myUnisa. PLEASE CHECK myUnisa ON A REGULAR BASIS AT http://my.unisa.ac.za 2.

LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 3.1 Lecturer(s) The primary lecturer for this module is [Emilia Mwim]: The details of the lecturers for this module are available on myUnisa welcome page, and were also sent to you via a tutorial letter. We have not included this information in this tutorial letter as this information changes on a regular basis depending on a number of reasons. Nevertheless, a number of communication channels are at yo u r disposal to communicate with lecturers, namely myUnisa, e-mail, telephone and face-to-face interactions. E-mail is the preferred channel for normal queries as it enables a quick response to students. When contacting your lecturers via e-mail, please make sure that you quote your student number and compose your e-mail with a clear and specific subject related to your query. Please expect your lecturer to respond to your query at least within 48 hours. When calling the lecturers, please take note that they are usually available in their offices from 08:30 to 13:00. Should you prefer to meet the lecturer in person, you need to make an appointment with the lecturer concerned either via e-mail or telephone. The e-mail addresses for this module are as follows: INF3703-20-S1@unisa.ac.za (for students registered for semester 01) INF3703-20-S2@unisa.ac.za (for students registered for semester 02) All queries that are NOT of a purely administrative nature (e.g. registrations) but are about the contents of this module, should be directed to the lecturers of this module. All administrative queries should be directed to the relevant divisions (e.g. registrations). Please do not use the lecturing staff’s personal e-mail addresses – unless agreed upon INF3703/101/3/2020 8 with the lecturer concerned. The above addresses will ensure that your e-mail will be answered, even if a particular lecturer is not available. Generally, most students experience the same types of problems. In this tutorial letter, we shall address some of the most common student queries, so please take the time to read through this tutorial letter as some of the questions that you may have might be answered in this tutorial letter. We present you with a comprehensive first tutorial letter to assist you in the best possible way to ensure that you have effective interaction with the lecturers of this module and Unisa in general. Some of the worst frustrations that our students have experienced include:  problems that are still unresolved after an effort to contact Unisa  the fact that it is necessary to contact Unisa more than once to solve a problem  the fact that students are passed from one person to another when they call In this module, we shall try to reduce these frustrations to a minimum and to help you to spend time effectively on your studies. To make this possible, it is necessary for you to understand the general regulations and workflow within Unisa and how this affects us all. Certain actions from your side can slow down the Unisa process, making it difficult for lecturers to provide you with the standard of service that they would like to. It is therefore important for you to take note of the instructions below. 3.2 Department The School of Computing can be contacted when you have difficulties in contacting or reaching the lecturers responsible for this module via e-mail, myUnisa and/or telephone.

HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 6.1 What does it mean to study a blended module? Studying a blended module may differ completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa.  All your study material and learning activities for blended and fully online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. Although blended modules include printed material, the module is designed to be delivered online.  All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate to you by email and sms, as well as using the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these ways to ask questions and contact your lecturers. INF3703/101/3/2020 11 6.2 myUnisa tools For the purpose of this module, you should have access to a computer that is linked to the internet. This will enable you to access resources and information about this module timeously. The myUnisa learning management system is Unisa's online campus that will help you to communicate with your lecturers, with other students and with the administrative departments of Unisa through the computer and the internet. To go to the myUnisa website, start at the main Unisa website, http://www.unisa.ac.za, and then click on “Login to myUnisa” on the right-hand side of the screen. This should take you to the myUnisa website. You can also go there directly by typing in http://my.unisa.ac.za. You will be able to download the tutorial matter from myUnisa. You are welcome to use the discussion forum for each module on myUnisa. This discussion forum is mainly for students to communicate with each other and may only be used for academic matters. The lecturers will not actively participate in the discussion forum, and therefore you should not post urgent questions for the lecturer’s attention here. Rather use the e-mail option if you have an urgent academic issue to discuss. myUnisa provides a number of resources that will enable you to receive support from your lecturers and fellow students. For this module, discussion forums are used quite extensively for various activities, such as working with your fellow students to solve assignment problems, and for self-assessments, which are meant to guide and support you in this module. We encourage you to participate in the discussion forums on a regular basis for your own benefit. Please note that any unethical conduct (e.g. the selling of assignment answers, advertising to do assignments for others and similar practices) is not permitted. When necessary, the lecturers will weigh in to questions, but will observe student discussions on module related issues Please consult the publication Study @ Unisa, which you will have received with your study material, for more information on myUnisa. 6.3 e-Tutors The university has started providing e-tutors to students, mainly for learning support. Currently, this service is provided to first, second and third year students. For this module, you will be notified timeously once you are linked to your e-tutor. 7.

More details will be communicated via myUnisa under Assignment 02 on the additional resources site. This assignment contributes a greater percentage towards your final mark at the end of the semester. Please study the relevant chapters carefully and constructively develop a database for your chosen organisation. To do this assignment, we recommend you study chapters 10, 11 and 12 (particularly Chapter 10 and 11) of your recommended textbook in detail as the textbook explains database design in great detail (recommended book: Coronel, C., Morris, S., Rob, P., and Crockett, K. 2013. Database Principles: Fundamentals of Design, Implementation, and Management (2nd edition). Cengage Learning. ISBN-13: 978-1-4080-4863-4 and ISBN-10: 1-4080-4863-9). The chapters will be made available to INF3703 students via additional resources. PLEASE NOTE Chapters 1 to 7 are covered in the second year database. The Chapters are beyond the scope of this module and will not form part of any assignments or the final examination. INF3703/101/3/2020 13 9. ASSESSMENT 9.1 Assessment plan For this module, you are required to complete and submit three (3) COMPULSORY assignments and to write one final examination.  Assignment 01, which is contained in this tutorial letter, is a multiple-choice assignment covering chapters 9 – 16.  Assignment 02, which is only available on myUnisa, covers chapters 9 – 11 (See section 8 above).  Assignment 03, which is only available on myUnisa, covers chapters 11 – 16. This assignment is also answered in the form of multiple-choice questions, but it is a TRUE or FALSE question. These assessments are meant to help you prepare for the assignments and the final examination, so please give them the attention they deserve.  Examination to be written at the end of the semester. This will be a two-hour examination covering all the examinable chapters in the table of section 6. All the assessments, namely the three assignments plus the examination, contribute towards your final mark at the end of the semester. Your final mark will be calculated as follows: PLEASE NOTE: You MUST get a sub-minimum of 40% for the main examination in order for your assignment year mark to be consider as part of your final mark. For example, if your year mark for the assignments is 80%, and you get 20% for the examination, your year mark would not be considered as part of your final mark. 9.2 Assignments 9.2.1 Unique assignment numbers Assignment number Unique number Due date 01 (semester 1) 831110 26 February 2020 Assignment 01 + Assignment 02 + Assignment 03 = Year mark 100% Assignment 01 = 25% of the year mark Assignment 02 = 50% of the year mark Assignment 03 = 25% of the year mark Year mark (30%) + Examination mark (70%) = Final mark INF3703/101/3/2020 14 02 (semester 1) 630845 20 April 2020 03 (semester 1) 830217 30 April 2020 01 (semester 2) 794707 14 August 2020 02 (semester 2) 680149 21 September 2020 03 (semester 2) 675975 30 September 2020 9.2.2 Due dates for assignments The due dates f o r the assignments are the last dates on which the relevant assignments should be received by the university. You are encouraged to submit your assignments at least one week before the due date to avoid submission problems. 9.2.3 Submission of assignments Please ensure that your assignments are submitted on or before the due dates indicated. Please note that NO exceptions or concessions will be made. Students who fail to submit even one assignment will automatically be excluded from the final examination. Electronic submission of a multiple-choice assignment  Connect to the URL: https://my.unisa.ac.za.  Log in with your credentials or register to become a user (if not registered).  Select the appropriate multiple-choice assignment. Proceed to fill in the electronic sheet as per your answers.  Submit the assignment after you have electronically made your selections.  Retain proof of your submission. Electronic submission of an essay assignment  Type your assignment by using a program such as MSWord, Word Perfect or Notepad. Avoid using macros or complicated diagrams.  Make sure that you convert your assignments to PDF format before submission to ensure that your assignments are compatible with the on-screen marking tool.  Choose the PDF file format (in the dropdown box).  Select the assignment file from your computer.  Submit and retain proof of your submission. IF YOU DO NOT USE THE CORRECT UNIQUE NUMBER, YOUR ASSIGNMENT WILL BE MARKED AGAINST THE WRONG MEMORANDUM OR WILL NOT BE MARKED AT ALL. INF3703/101/3/2020 15 Refer to the Study @ Unisa brochure for detailed instructions on the submission of assignments. 9.2.4 Plagiarism  Please avoid any form of plagiarism when completing your assignments. Plagiarism is the act of taking the words, ideas and thoughts of others and passing them off as your own. It is a form of theft that involves a number of dishonest academic activities.  Students are allowed to discuss the assignments with fellow students. However, we expect each student to submit his or her own assignment. Plagiarism is not acceptable under any circumstances. Furthermore, you are not allowed under any circumstances to do assignments for other students or to ask other students to do assignments for you. Disciplinary action will be taken against students who do not adhere to the university’s disciplinary code of conduct.  The sharing of assignment answers on the discussion forum is also not permitted under any circumstances. Students who continue with this practice will be subjected to disciplinary action.  All students receive a copy of the Disciplinary Code for Students (2004) when they register. You are advised to study the code, especially sections 2.1.13 and 2.1.4 (2004:3–4). Kindly also read the university’s Policy on Copyright Infringement and Plagiarism. 9.2.5 Assignment feedback Assignments are normally marked by lecturers and external markers officially appointed by the university. Please take note that the process of marking and processing your assignments usually takes about two to four weeks. Hence, we shall not accept any late assignments as this usually delays the whole process of marking and sending back feedback to students. Multiple-choice assignments are automatically marked by a computer system with pre-set submission and marking dates. Feedback on your marked multiple-choice assignment is usually made available on the myUnisa portal two weeks after the due date. Once all assignments have been marked and processed, model solutions will be made available on myUnisa via tutorial letters. Please check all solutions to improve your understanding of the different concepts and for examination preparation purposes. NOTE: All assignment marking queries need to be sent to the lecturers via e-mail. DO NOT FAX OR E-MAIL ASSIGNMENTS DIRECTLY TO THE LECTURERS. INF3703/101/3/2020 16 9.3 Examination Only one (1) venue-based examination will be written at the end of the semester, which will cover all the work of the module. Please consult the tutorial letters meant for guiding you on how to prepare for the main examination. You can find these on myUnisa (see section 8.1). 10. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS The Study @ Unisa brochure contains an A–Z guide of the most relevant study information. Here are some of the questions (with their answers) that students repeatedly ask: Where can I get hold of a copy of the textbook? Carlos Coronel and Steven Morris. 2017. Database Systems: Design, Implementation, and Management (12th edition) is the new edition of the database textbook that the university uses. You are therefore advised to purchase the book as soon as possible. If the university’s bookstore does not have the book in stock, ask the shop to order it for you. The bookstore will contact you as soon as the book is available. If the university bookstore cannot assist you, call Undergraduate Student Affairs. This department communicates directly with the bookstores and will probably be able to persuade the bookstores to order new stock. Undergraduate Student Affairs might refer you to bookstores that have the book in stock. I have not received some of my study material. What should I do? The Dispatch Department is responsible for distributing printed material. If the study material took longer than expected to reach you, you can visit myUnisa and download the course material from there. How do I go about forming a study group? Students are encouraged to form study groups. This is quite easy if you regularly visit discussion forums and interact with other students. The lecturers may not distribute any personal information about any student. When will I get my assignment back? It takes between four and five weeks to mark an assignment. Only after this period it will be returned to you. If you have not received your assignment after this period, check the discussion forums to see whether there are any delays, or contact the Assignment Department. What mark did I receive for my assignment? As soon as your assignment has been marked, the mark you received will be displayed on the myUnisa system. The multiple-choice assignment marks will be available two to three weeks after the due date for the assignment. The marks for written assignments may take longer. Have you received my assignment? If you used myUnisa to upload your assignment, you should immediately see that the assignment is on the system, next to the applicable assignment in the assignment list. If not, re-enter your answers. If you used the postal system, check myUnisa after two to three days INF3703/101/3/2020 17 after submitting your assignment. If it is not on the system, make enquiries with the Assignment Department. If it was not received, you will have to resubmit it. What software package should I use to draw the diagrams? You may use any software that you have access to. Microsoft Visio is probably the most popular, but you should be able to do most of the diagrams in Microsoft Power Point. 11.
