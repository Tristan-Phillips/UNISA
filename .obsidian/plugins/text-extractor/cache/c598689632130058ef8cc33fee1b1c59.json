The comprehensiveness of our curricula encapsulates a range of offerings, from strictly vocational to strictly academic certificates, diplomas and degrees. Unisa's \"openness\" and its distance eLearning character result in many students registering at Unisa who may not have had an opportunity to enrol in higher education. Our CODeL character implies that our programmes are carefully planned and structured to ensure success for students ranging from the underprepared with potential to the sufficiently prepared. Teaching and learning in a CODeL context involves multiple modes of delivery ranging from blended learning to fully online learning. As a default position, all postgraduate programmes are offered fully online with no printed study materials, while undergraduate programmes are offered in a blended mode of delivery where printed study materials are augmented with online teaching and learning via the learner management system – myUnisa. In some instances, undergraduate programmes are also offered fully online. Furthermore, our programmes are aligned with the vision, mission and values of the University. Unisa's commitment to serve humanity and shape futures combined with a clear appreciation of our location on the African continent, Unisa's graduates have the following distinctive graduate qualities: • independent, resilient, responsible and caring citizens who are able to fulfil and serve in multiple roles in their immediate and future local, national and global communities • a critical understanding of their location on the African continent with its histories, challenges and potential in relation to globally diverse contexts • the ability to critically analyse and evaluate the credibility and usefulness of information and data from multiple sources in a globalised world with its ever- increasing information and data flows and competing worldviews • application of their discipline-specific knowledges competently, ethically and creatively to solve real-life problems • an awareness of their own learning and developmental needs and future potential. The INF1505 module is offered online (all information is available via the internet) and we use myUnisa as our virtual campus. This is an online system that is used to administer, document and deliver educational material to you and support engagement with you. Look out for information from your lecturer as well as other Unisa platforms to determine how to access the virtual myUnisa module site. Information on the tools that will be available to engage with your lecturer and fellow students to support your learning will also be communicated via various platforms. You are encouraged to log into the module site, INF1505-23-Y, on myUnisa regularly. INF1505/101/0/2023 5 Because this is a fully online module, you have to use myUnisa to study and complete the learning activities for this module. Visit the website for INF1505-23-Y on myUnisa frequently. The website for your module is https://mymodules.dtls.unisa.ac.za/course/view.php?id=55749 We wish you every success with your studies! 2 MODULE OVERVIEW 2.1 Purpose This module covers the latest information technology, as well as the latest practices and trends relating to information technology. We use real-world examples and case studies to equip you with skills and knowledge that can easily be transferred to the business world. After you have studied this module, you will be able to apply concepts relating to information technology in your everyday life and to identify different classes of business information systems. You will also understand systems development and information systems in business and society in general. The knowledge, skills and values that you acquire will support you in any further studies you embark on and any work you do in the field of information technology, computer science or commerce. 2.2 Outcomes For this module, you will have to master several outcomes: • Specific outcome 1: Demonstrate and apply a fundamentals knowledge base of information systems in organisations. • Specific outcome 2: Analyse information technology components. • Specific outcome 3: Give an overview of business information systems. • Specific outcome 4: Examine how projects are planned, aligned with corporate goals and rapidly developed. • Specific outcome 5: Describe emerging trends, privacy, legal, security, health and ethical issues in information systems. 3 CURRICULUM TRANSFORMATION Unisa has implemented a transformation charter, in terms of which the university has placed curriculum transformation high on the teaching and learning agenda. Curriculum transformation includes student- centred scholarship; the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices; the scholarship of teaching and learning and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. All these will be phased in at programme and module level; and as a result of this, you will notice a marked change in the teaching and learning strategy implemented by Unisa together with the way in which the content is conceptualised in your modules. We encourage you to embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa in a responsive way within the framework of transformation 6 4 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 4.1 Lecturer The primary lecturer for this module is Mr ME Bogopa: Department: Information Systems Telephone: 011 670 9058 E-mail: INF1505-23-Y1@unisa.ac.za 4.2 Department You can contact the Department of Information Systems as follows: Telephone number: 011670 9200 E-mail: computing@unisa.ac.za 4.3 University The contact addresses of the various administrative departments appear on the Unisa website: http://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/corporate/default/Contact-us/Student-enquiries.

This is also true in the case of students enrolling at Unisa for the first time. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e- learning institution, and it is very different from face-to-face/contact institutions. It is a mega university, and all our programmes are offered through either blended learning or fully online learning. It is for this reason that we deemed it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support to help them to seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. We therefore offer a specialised student support programme to students enrolling at Unisa for the first time – Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme, designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE services are currently offered: • FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed, using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE • FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated. • FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (e.g videos on how to submit assessments online). • FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e- mail to fye@unisa.ac.za . 7.

Studying a fully online module differs completely from studying some other modules at Unisa. Studying a fully online module entails the following: • All the study material and learning activities for an online module are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All assignments must be submitted online. This means that you have to complete all the activities and submit all the assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may not post any assignments to Unisa, using the South African Post Office. • All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you by e-mail and SMS, as well as through the Announcements, Questions and Answers and Discussion Forum tools on myUnisa. (Please note that the Discussion Forum tool has been moved to the e-tutor sites.) You can also use all these platforms to ask questions and to contact lecturers. myUnisa tools INF1505/101/0/2023 15 myUnisa, which you can access at https://my.unisa.ac.za, is a facility that is available to all registered Unisa students. myUnisa enables you to perform study-related functions you would have performed by using postal services, the phone or by personally visiting a campus. myUnisa allows you to • have e-mail contact with lecturers • submit assignments (text and multiple-choice assignments) online • access your assignment marks • access your personal information records • participate in student discussion forums • notify the University of a change of address or the cancellation of study modules • access learning units and module-related information, including assignments myUnisa offers an electronic service to students; and 99% of the time it delivers a trustworthy and accurate service. However, there may be times when the myUnisa system is not available owing to upgrades. Also, you might sometimes experience problems with your internet connection when trying to access myUnisa. Moreover, there have been occasional complaints that the submission dates indicated on the myUnisa system were not correct. The Department of Information Systems is not responsible for myUnisa and is therefore unable to help you with the problems that may occur when using the system. If you have any queries regarding the services provided by myUnisa, contact the Unisa helpline and ask to be connected to the myUnisa helpdesk (which falls under the ICT Department). NB: It is very important that you log into myUnisa regularly – at least once a week – to do the following: • Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife e-mail account so that you receive the announcement e-mails on your cellphone. • Do the discussion forum activities on your e-tutor site. When doing the activities for each learning unit, you must share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you have to go online to post your messages. These extra ways of studying the material and practising the activities are intended to help you succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module, you must go online regularly to complete the activities and the assignments on time. 9. ASSESSMENT 9.1 Assessment criteria You must submit four formal quiz assignments for this module. You will find the assignments, labelled Assessment, – go to myModule Moodle and then to Assessment on your left-hand side and access your assignments: 16 The module comprises four assignments, one for each group of chapters in the syllabus. The last quiz assignment covers the last three chapters. Assignments 01, 02, 03 and 04 contribute 20%, 25%, 25% and 30%, respectively, towards your year mark. All assignments will be available for submission 10 days before their due dates. No extension of the due dates will be granted. If you do not submit an assignment on or before its due date, you will forfeit the marks of that assignment. Please make time to complete the assignments. Each quiz assignment has an allocated time of 40 minutes. Automatic marking will start when the time has elapsed. It is your responsibility to set aside 40 minutes to complete an assessment. You will have two attempts to complete Quiz Assignment 01 during the period it is open, and the highest mark will be recorded. You will have only one opportunity to submit each of the other assignments. Make sure that you only attempt a quiz assignment after you have read the chapters relating to that assessment. 9.2 Assessment plan • To complete this module, you will be required to submit four assessments. • All information about when and where to submit your assessments will be made available to you via the myModules site for your module. • Due dates for assessments, as well as the actual assessments are available on the myModules site for this module. • To gain admission to the examination, you will be required to submit at least three compulsory assignments. • To gain admission to the examination, you need to obtain a year mark average of 50% for the assignments. • The assignment weighting for the module is 20%. • You will receive examination information via the myModules sites. Please look out for announcements on how examinations will be conducted for the modules you are registered for. • The examination will count 80% towards the final module mark. 9.3 Assessment due dates • There are no assignment due dates included in this tutorial letter. INF1505/101/0/2023 17 • Assignment due dates will be made available to you on the myUnisa landing page for this module. We envisage that the due dates will be available to you on registration. • Please start working on your assessments as soon as you have registered for the module. • Log onto the myUnisa site for this module to obtain more information on the due dates for submission of the assessments. 9.4 Submission of assessments • Unisa, as a comprehensive open distance e-learning institution (CODeL), is moving towards becoming an online institution. You will therefore see that all your study material, assessments and engagements with your lecturer and fellow students will take place online. We use myUnisa as our virtual campus. • The myUnisa virtual campus will offer students access to the myModules site, where learning material will be available online and where assessments should be completed. This is an online system that is used to administer, document and deliver educational material to students and support engagement between academics and students. • The myUnisa platform can be accessed via https://my.unisa.ac.za. Click on the myModules 2023 tab to access the online sites for the modules you are registered for. • The University undertakes to communicate clearly and as frequently as necessary to ensure that you obtain the greatest benefit from using the myModules learning management system. Please access the announcements on your myModules site regularly, as this is where your lecturer will post important information to be shared with you. • When accessing your myModules site for the module/s you are registered for, you will see a welcome message posted by your lecturer. Below the welcome message you will see the assessment shells for the assessments you need to complete. Assessments may take the form of multiple-choice questions, tests, written assessments, forum discussions and so forth. All assessments must be completed in the assessment shells available on the respective module platforms. • To complete quiz assessments, please log onto the module site where you need to complete the assessment. Click on the relevant assessment shell (Assessment 01, Assessment 02, etc.). There will be a date on which the assessment will open for you. When the assessment is open, access the quiz online and complete it within the time available to you. Quiz assessment questions are not included in this tutorial letter (Tutorial Letter 101) and are only made available online. You must therefore access the quiz online and complete it online where the quiz has been created. • It is not advisable to use a cell phone to complete the quiz. Please use a desktop computer, tablet or laptop when completing the quiz. Students who use a cell phone find it difficult to use the Online Assessment tool on the small screen and often struggle to 18 navigate between questions and successfully complete the quizzes. In addition, cell phones are more vulnerable to dropped internet connections than other devices. If at all possible, please do not use a cell phone for this assessment type. • Please note the due date by which written assessments must be submitted. Ensure that you follow the guidelines given by your lecturer to complete the assessments. Click on the submission tab in the relevant assessment shell on myModules. You will then be able to upload your written assessment on the myModules site of the modules you are registered for. Before finalising the upload, double-check that you have selected the correct file for upload. Remember, no marks can be allocated for incorrectly submitted assessments. 9.5 The assessments As indicated in section 9.2, you need to complete four quiz assessments for this module. There are no assignments included in this tutorial letter. Assignments and due dates will be made available to you on myModules for this module. We envisage that the due dates will be available to you on registration. 9.6 Other assessment methods Your year mark will be based on your assignment marks. Each of the assignments (Assignments 01, 02, 03 and 04) will contribute between 20-30% towards your year mark. If you do not submit an assignment on or before its due date, you will receive no marks for it. No late submission of assignments can be accommodated because the assignments cannot be accessed after their due dates. There are no other assessment methods apart from the four quiz assignments that have to be submitted under Online Assessment on myUnisa. 9.7 The examination Examination information and details on the format of the examination will be made available to you online via the myUnisa site. Look out for information that will be shared with you by your lecturer and e-tutors (where relevant) and for communication from the University. An integrated assessment system is used for this module. This means that your final mark will be based not only on your examination mark, but also on your performance during the semester. Your final mark will be calculated as follows: year mark (out of 100) x 20% + examination mark (out of 100) x 80% You need a final mark of at least 50% to pass this module. Below is a detailed example of how the integrated assessment system works, assuming that Assignments 01, 02, 03 and 04 are submitted. (M = marks achieved; T = total number of possible marks) INF1505/101/0/2023 19 Assignment Marks achieved (M/T) % (M/T x 100) x weight % Year mark 01 15/25 60% x 0.25 15% 02 15/25 60% x 0.25 15% 03 20/25 80% x 0.25 20% 04 25/25 100% x 0.25 25% 15% of 20% Your year mark will contribute 20% towards your final mark and the examination mark will make up the other 80%. The examination will be written at the end of the year. The sequence of steps by which your final mark will be calculated is as follows: 1. year mark = (Assignment 01 x 25%) + (Assignment 02 x 25%) + (Assignment 03 x 25%) + (Assignment 04 x 25%) 2. examination mark (EM) = examination mark (EM) 3. final mark = (year mark x 20%) + (examination mark x 80%) =>40% in order to qualify for a supplementary examination =>50% final mark in order to pass the module NB: Admission to the examination will be handled automatically by computer. If you have any queries relating to the examination, you can send an e-mail to the Examination Department at exams@unisa.ac.za. You will only be admitted to the examination if you have submitted at least one assignment. 9.7.1 Invigilation/proctoring Since 2020 Unisa has conducted all assessments online. Given stringent requirements from professional bodies and increased solicitations of Unisa’s students by third parties to unlawfully assist them with the completion of assignments and examinations, the University is obliged to assure its assessment integrity by using various proctoring tools: Turnitin, Moodle Proctoring, the Invigilator App and IRIS. These tools will authenticate the student’s identity and flag suspicious behaviour to assure the credibility of students’ responses during assessments. The description below is for your benefit as you may encounter some of these tools or all of them in your registered modules: Turnitin is a plagiarism software that facilitates checks for originality in students’ submissions against internal and external sources. Turnitin assists in identifying academic fraud and ghost writing. Students are expected to submit typed responses for using the Turnitin software. 20 The Moodle Proctoring tool is a facial recognition software that authenticates students’ identity during their quiz assessments. This tool requires access to a student’s mobile or laptop camera. Students must ensure that their camera is activated in their browser settings prior to their assessments. The Invigilator “mobile application-based service does verification” of the identity of an assessment participant. The Invigilator Mobile Application detects student dishonesty-by-proxy and ensures that the assessment participant is the registered student. This invigilation tool requires students to download the app from their Play Store (Google, Huawei and Apple) on their mobile devices (camera enabled) prior to their assessment. IRIS Invigilation software verifies the identity of a student during assessment and provides for both manual and automated facial verification. It has the ability to record and review a student’s assessment session. It flags suspicious behaviour by the students for review by an academic administrator. IRIS software requires installation on students’ laptop devices that are enabled with a webcam. Students who are identified and flagged for suspicious dishonest behaviour arising from the invigilation and proctoring reports are referred to the disciplinary office for formal proceeding. Please note: Students must refer to their module assessment information on their myModule sites to determine which proctoring or invigilation tool will be utilised for their formative and summative assessments. Also note that it is mandatory to have one of the formative assessments utilise the proctoring tool that will be utilised in the summative assessments to alleviate pressures associated with the lack of examination unreadiness by students. It is recommended that the quiz assessment of CSET modules use IRIS software; hence, the last assignment will use IRIS software. 9.8 Supplementary You will have only one opportunity to write the examination. There is no automatic admission to a supplementary examination. To qualify for an additional (supplementary) examination opportunity, you must obtain a final mark of at least 40% in the examination. If you qualify, your account will be debited with a fee and you will be registered for a supplementary examination. In the supplementary examination only the examination mark will be taken into account. You will have to obtain at least 50% in the supplementary examination to pass. 10. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY 10.1 Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of taking the words, ideas and thoughts of others and presenting them as your own. It is a form of theft. Plagiarism includes the following forms of academic dishonesty: • Copying and pasting from any source without acknowledging the source. • Not including references or deliberately inserting incorrect bibliographic information. • Paraphrasing without acknowledging the original source of the information. INF1505/101/0/2023 21 You are not allowed to use someone’s answers that have been posted on social media (e.g Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp). If someone posts his/her assignment answers on a social media network, please report that person at INF1505-23-Y1@unisa.ac.za. You may not take pictures of assignment questions to share them on social media. Furthermore, you may not distribute an illegal copy of the prescribed book, such as a PDF copy, on social media. Steps will be taken by the University authorities should this practice come to light. 10.2 Cheating Cheating includes, but is not limited to, the following: • Completing assessments on behalf of another student, copying the work of another student during an assessment, or allowing another student to copy your work. • Using social media (e.g WhatsApp, Telegram) or other platforms to disseminate assessment information. • Submitting corrupt or irrelevant files; this forms part of examination guidelines • Buying completed answers from so-called “tutors” or internet sites (contract cheating). 10.3 For more information about plagiarism, follow the link below: https://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/myunisa/default/Study-@-Unisa/Student-values-and-rules 11. STUDENTS LIVING WITH DISABILITIES The Advocacy and Resource Centre for Students with Disabilities (ARCSWiD) provides an opportunity for staff to interact with first-time and returning students with disabilities. If you are a student with a disability and would like additional support or need additional time for assessments, you are invited to contact Mr Ephraim Bogopa at 011 670 9058 to discuss the assistance that you need. 12. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS • I did not receive any study material. What should I do? You will not receive any study material in hardcopy format because the module is delivered online. Note, however, that you have to buy a prescribed book. • What do I do if I cannot find the prescribed book? See section 5.1. • What will happen if I fail to submit my assignment on time? If the myUnisa system is down when you try to submit an assignment, do not contact the lecturers. Wait until the problem is resolved and then submit your assignment as soon as possible. We are usually aware of problems relating to myUnisa. No assignment will be marked (a mark of ZERO will be awarded) after the solutions for the assignment have been published. This is usually a week or two after the due date of the assignment. 22 • How do I request an extension? Please do not phone, fax or e-mail for an extension to submit an assignment. Submit the assignment as soon as possible, otherwise you will forfeit that portion of term mark. • What if there are mistakes in the marking of assignments? (Do NOT resubmit your assignment to the Assignments Department!) There is no inconsistency in our marking because all online assignments are marked by the system. If there are wrong answers to questions we request that students only query assignment marking where the marks will change significantly (more than 5%). There is no remarking for QUIZ/MCQ assignments. • What if I do not receive my study material or I lose it? Visit myUnisa and download an electronic copy (PDF file). NB: We do not provide prescribed books to students. You are expected to buy the book. • May I submit my assignment by e-mail? No, this is not possible for quiz/ online assignments. • Have we received your assignment? If you want to find out whether Unisa has received your assignment, look at the status of your assignment on myUnisa. Other questions can be found under the FAQ tool on myUnisa. 13.
