What does this information tell us about the possible nature of the agent's environment and its sensors? Justify your answer (3) (c) Inthe Francs and Pounds puzzle there is a container with five cells. In the inttial state of the container the two leftmost cells are occupied by a Franc con each, while two Pound coins occupy the two rightmost cells.
