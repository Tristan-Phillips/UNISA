Please read this document in its entirety as it contains very important information about the module. It contains all the information about the module assignments. More details can be found online (myUnisa portal). Databases I is a fully online module. This means all communication, tutorial matter and submissions related to the module will be done through myUnisa (my.unisa.ac.za). There is no study guide for this module and the prescribed book for the module is mentioned in section 4.1. No tutorial matter (tutorial letters) will be sent to you through the post. All registered students have access to this website. Please refer to the Study @ Unisa brochure (www.unisa.ac.za) on how to access myUnisa and activate your myLife student account. It is therefore compulsory that you visit myUnisa on a regular basis and check your Unisa (myLife) e-mail regularly for the duration of your studies. We will be sending regular announcements and it is your responsibility to read them and take appropriate action afterwards. Please refer to Tutorial Letter 301 for the contact details of the lecturers and the School of Computing. Alternatively, send an e-mail to the module mailbox. The following are the approximate dates for the beginning of both semesters in 2019: Semester 1: 28 January 2019 Semester 2: 15 July 2019 Therefore, plan your registration accordingly and visit myUnisa to begin your studies and to check all due dates for online assignments. Please note that no extensions will be granted for late submission of any assignments in this module. We are looking forward to seeing you online in 2019. 4 2 PURPOSE OF AND OUTCOMES FOR THE MODULE 2.1 Purpose This module serves as a fundamental building block in equipping students with the knowledge and competencies to understand and use databases.

What does it mean to say that a database displays both entity integrity and referential integrity? (2) b. What is a strong (or identifying) relationship and how is it depicted in a Crow’s Foot ERD? (2) c. What is an entity cluster and what advantages are derived from its use? (3) d. What is a surrogate primary key and when would you use one? (3) e. When implementing a 1:1 relationship, where should you place the foreign key if one side is mandatory and one side is optional? Should the foreign key be mandatory or optional? (4) Question 2 [5] Suppose you are working within the framework of the conceptual model shown in ERD diagram below. The ERD INF2603/101 15 a. Write the ten cardinalities that are appropriate for this ERD. (5) 16 Question 3 [60] 3.1. The manager of a consulting firm has asked you to evaluate a database that contains the table structure shown in the table below. Table: Sample CLIENT Records Attribute Name Sample Value Sample Value Sample Value CLIENT_NUM 298 289 289 CLIENT_NAME Marianne R. Brown James D. Smith James D.

Rivera CONSULTANT_REGION_3 Midwest Southeast CONSULTANT_NUM_4 18 CONSULTANT_NAME_4 Donald Tau CONSULTANT_REGION_4 West The table was created to enable the manager to match clients with consultants. The objective is to match a client within a given region with a consultant in that region, and to INF2603/101 17 make sure that the client’s need for specific consulting services is properly matched to the consultant’s expertise. For example, if the client needs help with database design and is located in the south-east, the objective is to make a match with a consultant who is located in the south-east and whose expertise is in database design. (Although the consulting company manager tries to match consultant and client locations to minimise travel expense, it is not always possible to do so.) The following basic business rules are maintained:  Each client is located in one region  A region can contain many clients.  Each consultant can work on many contracts  Each contract might require the services of many consultants.  A client can sign more than one contract but each contract is signed by only one client.  Each contract might cover multiple consulting classifications. (For example, a contract may list consulting services in database and networking.)  Each consultant is located in one region.  A region can contain many consultants.  Each consultant has one or more areas of expertise (class). For example, a consultant might be classified as an expert in both database design and networking.  Each area of expertise (class) can have many consultants in it. For example, the consulting company might employ many consultants who are networking experts. a. Given that brief description of the requirements and the business rules, write the relational schema and draw the dependency diagram for the preceding (and very poor) table structure. Label all transitive and/or partial dependencies. (15) b. Break up the dependency diagram you drew in Problem 3a to produce dependency diagrams that are in 3NF and write the relational schema. (Hint: You might have to create a few new attributes. Also make sure that the new dependency diagrams contain attributes that meet proper design criteria; that is, make sure that there are no multivalued attributes, that the naming conventions are met, and so on.) (15) c. Using the results of Problem 3b, draw the Crow’s Foot ERD. (30) Question 4 [8] 18 a. What is a CROSS JOIN? Give an example of its syntax. (4) b. Explain why the two following commands produce different results. (2) SELECT DISTINCT COUNT (V_CODE) FROM PRODUCT; SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT V_CODE) FROM PRODUCT; c. What MS Access/SQL Server function should you use to calculate the number of days between the current date and 25 January 1999? (2) Question 5 [13] The CIS Department at the UNIVERSITY OF SOWETO maintains the Free Acess to Current Technology (FACT) library of e-books.

Write the SQL query to list the assignment number, project number, employee number and assignment charge per hour for all the projects that were assigned after the 24th of March 2018. Sort the results by employee number. (3) b. Write the SQL code that will list only the distinct project numbers in the ASSIGNMENT table, sorted by project number. (4) c. Write the SQL code to validate the ASSIGN_CHARGE values in the ASSIGNMENT table. Your query should retrieve the assignment number, employee number, project number, the stored assignment charge (ASSIGN_CHARGE), and the calculated assignment charge (calculated by multiplying ASSIGN_CHG_HR by ASSIGN_HOURS).
