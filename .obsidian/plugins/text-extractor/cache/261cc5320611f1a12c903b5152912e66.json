The relationship between the way controls have been positioned and what they do makes it easy for a user to find the appropriate control for task  Feedback-involves sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished. Various kinds of feedback are available-audio, tactile, verbal, visual and combination of these  Constraints-refers to determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. Examples are- deactivating certain menu options, thereby restricting users only to permissible options at that stage of the activity or the physical design of a device which allows only a particular cable/card/plug to be inserted into specific slots/sockets  Consistency-refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations/ use similar elements for archiving similar tasks.one of the benefits of consistent interfaces is that they are easier to learn and use  Affordance-refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. To afford means to give a clue.eg. a mouse button invites pushing a door handle affords pulling, interfaces should make it obvious what can be done for them Question 2 Gimmicks Frustration can happen when clicking on a link to a website only to discover that is still under construction. It can be more annoying when the website displays an ‘Under Construction” merely increase icon, which the users frustration, having made the effort to visit the website. Error Messages Error messages are notorious for their incomprehensibility. It would be more helpful to provide information about how to resolve / overcome the problem. Threatening error messages can also cause users to become anxious. Use of bold red letters and exclamation marks can be counter-productive Ideally, error messages should be treated as “how to fix it” messages. They should state the cause of the problem, and what the user needs to do to fix it. Waiting Website or software apps that take a long time to download can be frustrating. Links that hang and eventually do to load can be very annoying Upgrading Another common frustration is upgrading the software. More often time – consuming, and requires a range of things such as resetting preference, checking configurations, and learning new ways of doing things Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Appearance People are often annoyed by  Website that are overloaded by text and graphics, making it difficult to find and access information ;  Flashing animations, pop ups, banner ads, that can cover what the user is looking for, and which require them to click on check boxes to close them  The over-use of sound effects and music;  Features – an excessive number of buttons and options, such as a remote controls;  Childish designs that keep popping up, such as certain types of helper agents;  Poorly laid out keyboards, pads, control panels, and other out input devices that cause users to press the wrong keys or buttons Question 3 a) Heuristic evaluation is a form of usability inspection where usability specialists judge whether each element of a user interface follows a list of established usability heuristics. b) Briefing session, evaluation period, and debriefing c) Problem of using heuristics is that designers can sometimes be led astray by finding that are not as accurate as they first appeared to be Question 4 A conceptual model is a high-level description of how a system is organised and operates. An abstraction that outlines what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand interacting with it 1 Core conceptual model  Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what product is for and how to use it for an activity  The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task -domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes and operations that can be performed on them  The relationship between those concepts  The mapping between the concepts and user experience the product is designed to support or invoke Question5 a) With an early focus on users and tasks it is broken down into 5 sub  User task and goals are driving force behind the development  User’s behaviour and context of use are studied and system is designed to support them  User characteristics are captured and designed for Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  Users are consulted throughout the development from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account  All design decision are taken within the context of the users, their work and their environment b) Improving my unisa system  User task and goals are driving force behind the development. It is a major principle of the functionality of improving the my unisa system application for students and is aimed to give a user friendly attribute to all the users .  User’s behaviour and context of use are studied and system is designed to support them. The improvement on my unisa system will allow the students to use their mobile phones. All the functionality will be available across interfaces for my unisa students to use the system.  User characteristics are captured and designed for. My unisa system will be improved to cater for different characteristics as the learning institute has diverse learner group with different background, cultures and age that is the system will be improved in English language to accommodate everyone. It is also improved to allow students to interact with the system well  Users are consulted throughout the development from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account. During the early stage of my unisa system improvement the students were asked to complete needs survey. They pointed out their major requirement that the system is overloaded. There is a lot of traffic on the current system. hence, they will need a system that will allow them to use their phones as well when they are not on campus  All design decision is taken within the context of the users, their work and their environment. Performing a self-evaluation as a method of study and testing level of understating the system. The system was implemented correct on tasks completed and allow them to use the system more often anywhere on their mobile phones Question 6 Types of interviews  Unstructured interviews- open ended conversational  Structured interviews-predetermined questions are asked with available answers ie which of the following best describes….  Semi structured interviews- combination of unstructured and semi structured  Focus group- facilitator with group members Question 7 Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  Physical pleasure – refers to bodily pleasure connect to sensory experience e.g. touch, taste, and smell .An example is the tactile pleasure of holding a sleek cell phone  Socio – pleasure – refers to the enjoyment of being in the company of others, such as loved ones, friends, and colleagues. An example is showing one another photos on a digital camera  Psycho-pleasure – refers to peoples’ emotional and cognitive reactions to product. An example is the emotionally satisfying experience of shopping on the web using an on-line site that is both pleasing and easy to use (Similar to Normans’ behavioural level)  Ideo – pleasure (cognitive )- refers to peoples’ values entails the aesthetics of a product and the cultural and personal values a personal values a person attributes to it e.g. Using a “green” product (Similar to Normans’ reflective level) Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Oct/nov 2016 Question 1 I. Interface metaphors-Visual representation of a physical object on the computer. Ex. calculator, shopping cart II. Anthropomorphism-attributing human qualities to animals and objects III. User experience--How a product behaves and is used by people in the real world -How people feel about it, pleasure and satisfaction when using, looking, holding, opening and closing it -Cannot design a user experience, only design for a user experience IV. Utility-extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality V. Usability-Usability means easy to learn Effective to use and provide an enjoyable experience Question 2 2.1 A conceptual model is a high-level description of how a system is organised and operates. An abstraction that outlines what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand interacting with it 2.2 Core conceptual model  Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what product is for and how to use it for an activity  The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task -domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes and operations that can be performed on them  The relationship between those concepts  The mapping between the concepts and user experience the product is designed to support or invoke 2.3 interface applications are actually based on well-established conceptual models e.g most on line shopping website are based on the core aspects of the customer experience when at a shopping mall Shopping cart, proceeding to check-out, 1-click, gift wrapping.... Question 3 4,1-persuasive technology-interactive computing systems that are deliberately designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviour 4,2-by pop up ads that frustrates people also warning messages and virtual agents and toys can also be patronizing and annoying in certain contents Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Question 4 5,1  Setting Goals There are many different reasons for gathering data, and before beginning it is important to identify specific goals for the study  Identifying Participants The goals you develop for your data gathering session will indicate the kind of people you want to gather data from  Relationship with Participants One significant aspect of any data gathering is the relationship between the person/s doing the gathering and the person/s providing the data. Making sure this relationship is clear and professional will help to clarify the nature of the study  Triangulation Triangulation- is a term used to refer to the investigation of phenomenon from (at least) two different perspectives  Pilot Studies Pilot study – is a small trial run of the main study. The aim is to make sure that the proposed method is viable before embarking on the real study 5.2 What should be avoided when designing interview questions?  Try and keep questions neutral  Interviewers may not understand jargon or complex language. Keep questions simple  Compound sentences can be confusing , so split them into two separate questions 5.3 The importance of involving users Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace The best way to make sure that development continues to take users activities into account is to involve real users throughout the development. In this way developers can better understand user goals leading to a more appropriate more usable product. It also assist in setting expectations of the user Question 5 Frustrating ;application not working or crashing, user expectations not met, application does not do what the users wants, vague error messages, gimmicky, patronizing, interface, too many steps to do a task, insufficient information Typical reasons for frustration when using a computer  Application does not work properly e.g, when you want to use certain apps the computer freezes and you have to reboot the computer  Doesn’t do what users want it to, e,g the auto correct when typing messages, if you do not double check before sending messages, you would send meaningless messages  Not sufficient information , e,g help documentation on computer apps does not usually provide sufficient instructions for a user to successfully configure an application  Vague/ obtuse error messages, e,g error messages such as “system not available, try later’ are meaningless because they do not specify a time period after when can try again. It would be more helpful to provide information about how to resolve/ overcome the problem. Threatening error messages can also cause users to become anxious. The use of bold red letters and exclamation marks can be counter-productive. Ideally, error messages should be treated as “how to fix it’  Frustration can happen with voice commands. Sometimes voice commands fail to recognise some people s accents  Websites or software apps that take a long time to download can be frustrating. Links that hang and eventually do not load can also be very annoying  Another common frustration is upgrading software. More often than not it is time-consuming, and requires a range of things such as resetting preferences, checking configurations, and learning new ways of doing things  Mobile websites that are overloaded by text and graphics, making it difficult to find and access information, too much scrolling  Typing on a computer s default on-screen keyboard can be frustrating due to errors Question 6 7.1 The environment in which the testing is done Environment Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Usability testing Laboratory like conditions where the conditions are controlled Field studies Done in natural environment where the system or product is used 7.2 The participants The participants Usability testing Qualifying users 5-12 users are an acceptable number. Field studies An outsider looking on qualitative techniques and an insider the ethnography in which the aim is to explore the details of what happens in a particular social setting 7.3 Data collection Data collection Usability testing Laboratory user test captured through video recording of body gestures, think aloud, observation User satisfaction questionnaires and interviews are also used Field studies Qualitative techniques like interviews, observation and ethnography can be used .data is captured through audio and video recording, taking field notes, filling diaries 7.4 Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Advantages and disadvantages of usability testing and field studies Advantages Disadvantages Usability testing  Feedback is direct from target audience  Variables are controllable  Security of sensitive data be enforced  Ability to capture user reactions through body gestures, language and facial expression of participants  Laboratory based usability studies capture a snapshot of the use in a simulated use environment  Simulating the use setting is very hard, time consuming, expensive and sometimes impossible to attain  Users are isolated from contextual factors  New electronic devices are used in a context, in which multitasking is a key factor  Evaluation use experience developed overtime instead of snapshot of use provides more reliable information Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Field studies  Eliminates both the need for a lab environment and the effect of a lab environment on participation  Accommodates diverse group of participants  Generally is less expensive than a traditional in person lab testing  It is an opportunity to administer the test to a larger group of people than you might be able to accommodate in a lab environment  Security could be compromised if testing sensitive, privilege, or intellectual property  Restricted or no view of the user’s body language might inhibit some of the cues to their reactions to the material being tested  Technical difficulties are likely if users are : o Not comfortable with the technology involved o Have conflicting software or equipment on their machines o Are unable to share their screen over the internet o Have unreliable or slow connection speeds o If your test requires special equipment or software downloads or plug- ins which the participants may be unwilling or unable to download Question 7 8.1 Nielsen’s heuristics 1. Visibility of system status 2. Match between system and real world 3. User control and freedom 4. Consistency and standards 5. Error prevention 8.2 a. A good graphical design is important reading long sentences and paragraphs is difficult on the screen (aesthetic and minimalist design) b. Avoid excess use of colour. Colour is useful for indicating different kinds of information(user control and freedom) c. Avoid excess use of graphics(aesthetic and minimalist design) d. Download time for smartphone applications must be short (flexibility and efficiency of use) Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace October November 2015 Question 1 Types of Affordance an affordance is the design aspect of an object which suggest how the object should be used; a visual clue to its function and use cognitive affordance, physical affordance, sensory affordance, and functional affordance. The terms cognitive affordance (Norman’s perceived affordance) and physical affordance (Norman’s real affordance) refer to parallel and equally important usability concepts for interaction design, to which sensory affordance plays a supporting role. We argue that the concept of physical affordance carries a mandatory component of utility or purposeful action (functional affordance). Finally, we provide guidelines to help designers think about how these four kinds of affordance work together naturally in contextualized HCI design or evaluation. Question 2 Gimmicks Frustration can happen when clicking on a link to a website only to discover that is still under construction. It can be more annoying when the website displays an ‘Under Construction” merely increase icon, which the users frustration, having made the effort to visit the website.

Core conceptual model  Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what product is for and how to use it for an activity eg browsing, book marking  The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task -domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes and operations that can be performed on them eg saving, revisiting, organizing  The relationship between those concepts eg whether one object contains another, the relative importance of actions to others, and whether an object is part of another  The mapping between the concepts and user experience the product is designed to support or invoke. Eg one can revisit through looking at a list of visited sites, mostly frequently visited or saved websites 2. How each component relates to usability goal  Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what product is for and how to use it for an activity.it relates to effectiveness  The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task -domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes and operations that can be performed on them. it relates to efficiency Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  The relationship between those concepts. It relates to learnability  The mapping between the concepts and user experience the product is designed to support or invoke. It relates to safety Question 4 Interface metaphors- are considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. They provide a structure that is similar in some ways to aspects of a familiar entity but that also have their own behaviours and properties. It is instantiated in some way as part of the user interface. eg: The desktop metaphor. The search engine, interface metaphors are intended to provide familiar entities that enable people to readily understand the underlying conceptual model and know what to do at an interface. Question 5 Cognitive modeling involves creating a computational model to estimate how long it takes people to perform a given task. Models are based on psychological principles and experimental studies to determine times for cognitive processing and motor movements. Cognitive models can be used to improve user interfaces or predict problem errors and pitfalls during the design process. A few examples of cognitive models include: Parallel design With parallel design, several people create an initial design from the same set of requirements. Each person works independently, and when finished, shares concepts with the group. The design team considers each solution, and each designer uses the best ideas to further improve their own solution. This process helps generate many different, diverse ideas, and ensures that the best ideas from each design are integrated into the final concept. This process can be repeated several times until the team is satisfied with the final concept Human processor model Main article: Human processor model Sometimes it is useful to break a task down and analyze each individual aspect separately. This helps the tester locate specific areas for improvement. To do this, it is necessary to understand how the human brain processes information. Question6 1. Types of pleasures  Physical pleasure – refers to bodily pleasure connect to sensory experience e.g. touch, taste, and smell .An example is the tactile pleasure of holding a sleek cell phone Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  Socio – pleasure – refers to the enjoyment of being in the company of others, such as loved ones, friends, and colleagues. An example is showing one another photos on a digital camera  Psycho-pleasure – refers to peoples’ emotional and cognitive reactions to product. An example is the emotionally satisfying experience of shopping on the web using an on-line site that is both pleasing and easy to use (Similar to Normans’ behavioural level)  Ideo – pleasure (cognitive )- refers to peoples’ values entails the aesthetics of a product and the cultural and personal values a personal values a person attributes to it e.g. Using a “green” product (Similar to Normans’ reflective level) 2. Using a cell phone as an example to achieve pleasures  Physical pleasure – refers to bodily pleasure connect to sensory experience e.g. touch, taste, and smell .An example is the tactile pleasure of holding a sleek cell phone  Socio – pleasure – refers to the enjoyment of being in the company of others, such as loved ones, friends, and colleagues. An example is showing one another photos on a digital camera using cell phone by taking every event for social life and reference  Psycho-pleasure – refers to peoples’ emotional and cognitive reactions to product. An example is the emotionally satisfying experience of shopping on the web using an on-line site that is both pleasing and easy to use such as the use of Take a lot and Sando to shop on line using your cell-phone  Ideo – pleasure (cognitive )- refers to peoples’ values entails the aesthetics of a product and the cultural and personal values a personal values a person attributes to it e.g. Using a “green” product . to use your cell phone to down load descent staff that will portray your personal values, what you are interested in Question 7 1. Triangulation is a term used to refer to the investigation of a phenomenon from a t least two different perspectives. Four types of triangulation are:  Triangulation of data-means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in different places, or from different people  Investigator triangulation-means that different researches observers, interviewers etc have been used to collect and interpret data  Triangulation of theories- means different theoretical frameworks through which to view the data findings  Methodological triangulation-means to employ different data gathering techniques. This is the most common from triangulation 2. My unisa Student system by  Triangulation of data-means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in different places, or from different people. By asking all the student to give the requirements of my unisa Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace student system how it will to look like. What they want, their needs that is student requirements  Investigator triangulation-means that different researches observers, interviewers etc have been used to collect and interpret data. Data collection technique will be used , student will be interviewed, observed. Given questionnaires to draw information regarding the my unisa student system  Triangulation of theories- means different theoretical frameworks through which to view the data findings. Data collected from students will be gathered or demonstrated in different charts or table  Methodological triangulation-means to employ different data gathering techniques. This is the most common from triangulation. Different data collected from the students will be compiled to give result of the research on my unisa student system Question 8  Can be interactive, and can include check boxes , radio button, pull down and pop-up menus, help screens etc  It can also provide Immediate validation  Reaching a large number quickly Question 9  Early focus on end users and the tasks they need the system/device to do  Empirical measurement using quantitative or qualitative measures  Iterative design, in which the designers work in a series of stages, improving the design each time Early focus on users and tasks The design team should be user-driven and it should be in direct contact with potential users. Several evaluation methods, including personas, cognitive modeling, inspection, inquiry, prototyping, and testing methods may contribute to understanding potential users and their perceptions of how well the product or process works. Usability considerations, such as who the users are and their experience with similar systems must be examined. As part of understanding users, this knowledge must \"...be played against the tasks that the users will be expected to perform. “This includes the analysis of what tasks the users will perform, which are most important, and what decisions the users will make while using your system. Designers must understand how cognitive and emotional characteristics of users will relate to a proposed system. One way to stress the importance of these issues in the designers' minds is to use personas, which are made-up representative users. See below for further discussion of personas. Another more expensive but more insightful method is to have a panel of potential users work closely with the design team from the early stages. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Empirical measurement Test the system early on, and test the system on real users using behavioral measurements. This includes testing the system for both learnability and usability. It is important in this stage to use quantitative usability specifications such as time and errors to complete tasks and number of users to test, as well as examine performance and attitudes of the users testing the system. Finally, \"reviewing or demonstrating\" a system before the user tests it can result in misleading results. The emphasis of empirical measurement is on measurement, both informal and formal, which can be carried out through a variety of evaluation methods. Iterative design Iterative design is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a product or process. Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design. In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented. The key requirements for Iterative Design are: identification of required changes, an ability to make changes, and a willingness to make changes. When a problem is encountered, there is no set method to determine the correct solution. Rather, there are empirical methods that can be used during system development or after the system is delivered, usually a more inopportune time. Ultimately, iterative design works towards meeting goals such as making the system user friendly, easy to use, easy to operate, simple, etc. Question 10 Use of HTA has been controversial – there are two main problems –  Real tasks are very complex, and task analysis does not scale well. The notation soon becomes unwieldy and difficult to follow  Task analysis is limited in the kinds of tasks it can model – It cannot model tasks that are overlapping or parallel, nor can it model interruption Question 11 Types of evaluation  Summative evaluation –assess the success of a finished product  Formative evaluation- done during design to check that product continues to meet user’s needs. Cover a broad range of design processes from the development of early sketches and prototypes through to tweaking and perfecting an almost finished design Question 12 Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Stages of Heuristic evaluation  The briefing session- in which the experts are told what to do  The evaluation period – in which each expert typically spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using heuristics for guidance. The experts need to take at least two passes through the interface. The first pass gives a feel for the flow of the interaction and product’s scope and second pass allow the evaluator to focus on specific interface elements in the context of the whole product and to identify potential usability problems  The debriefing session- in which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solution Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplaceStuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Downloaded by: neilgovender2020 | neil.govender@smiths.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
