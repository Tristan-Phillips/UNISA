[TURN PAGE] 2 COS3751 October/November 2020 Question 1 State Spaces [17] Block stacking This question involves a problem-solving agent. The agent is being asked to solve the problem of stacking six identical blocks into a structure where there are three blocks in the bottom row, two blocks in the middle row and one block in the top row – as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: The desired result of block stacking (a) Explain why we call this agent a problem-solving agent. (1) (b) Deﬁne a non-graphical (i.e. no pictures) state representation for the problem. Your state representation should be such that a search algorithm will be able to start the search at any given state. (2) (c) Defend your choice by showing that the level of abstraction is sufﬁcient. (Hint: Your state representation should only encode the necessary information). (2) (d) What is the initial state? (1) (e) What is the goal state? (1) (f) Deﬁne the appropriate actions for this problem. Then using the successor function Result(a, S) 7→ S′, show how applying each action a to some state S results in some state S′. (4) (g) Using the state representation you deﬁned above, draw the state space for the block stacking problem. (6) [TURN PAGE] 3 COS3751 October/November 2020 Question 2 Searching [12] (a) Consider the graph provided in Figure 2, perform a Uniform Cost Search (UCS) on the graph; assume that the start node is N , and the goal node is F . H B G K N D E C J A O L I M F 4 8 10 7 5 8 4 6 7 4 3 2 7 5 8 Figure 2: Search The actual distance between each pair of nodes is indicated on the respective edge. Specify the nodes in the order they are expanded. At each step, specify the frontier, including the ˆg value of each node in the frontier. Be sure to indicate the path as part of each node in the frontier: for example, if your search has generated a search node from node A to B of length 3, then indicate it as A-B (3) in the frontier. Use the following format for your answer (step 1 has been provided already): (10) Step Node expanded Frontier 1 N (ˆg = 0) : : : (b) Explain the intuition behind the operation of the UCS with respect to the goal test happening during expansion and not during generation. (2) [TURN PAGE] 4 COS3751 October/November 2020 Question 3 Adversarial Search [13] Consider the game tree in Figure 3 and then answer the questions that follow. (The static utility values for the leaf nodes are provided below each leaf node, and node A is a MAX node.) A B D 7 E I 9 J -2 F 9 C G K -3 L 6 H 17 M 9 Figure 3: Game tree (a) Provide the backed-up utility values for all the non-leaf nodes in the tree if a minimax search is performed. (5) (b) Suppose that alpha/beta pruning is applied during the search. Write down the α and β values associated with nodes A, B, E, C and G (after the search completes). NB: Write down the node as well as the α and β values for that node. (8) [TURN PAGE] 5 COS3751 October/November 2020 Question 4 Constraint Satisfaction Problems [17] Scrumptious Deli prepares take-home meals to order. The meals that can be ordered, and the time each takes to prepare (in minutes), are speciﬁed in Table 1: Meal Time to prepare Lasagne 45 Chicken Pie 80 Bacon & Potato Bake 45 Pap & Wors 30 Lamb Curry 90 Table 1: Meals to order Scrumptious employs a number of part-time cooks to prepare meals, and they need to minimise this number to save costs. Orders must be placed by clients at least the day before they are needed. Scrumptious promises to have everything freshly made, i.e. the meals aren’t prepared hours in advance, but are timed to be ready precisely when the client says they will pick it up. Each order is prepared by one cook. On a particular day, they receive the orders speciﬁed in Table 2: Order # Meal Ready by 1 Lasagne 11:00 2 Bacon & Potato Bake 12:00 3 Chicken Pie 12:30 4 Pap & Wors 12:45 5 Lasagne 13:00 6 Lamb Curry 14:00 7 Bacon & Potato Bake 14:30 Table 2: Orders on a particular day (a) Deﬁne the variables for this CSP, as well as the domain for each variable. (4) (b) Provide the constraints for this problem. Note: Preparation of each meal should com- mence at the precise time needed to have it ready for the client. (5) (c) Draw a constraint graph for this problem. (5) (d) What are the minimum number of cooks needed, so that all meals are prepared pre- cisely on time? Which orders will they prepare? (3) [TURN PAGE] 6 COS3751 October/November 2020 Question 5 First-order Logic [22] Consider the following English statements. 1. Anyone who drives any car and is distracted will have an accident. 2. If Stephanie owns a car, she will drive it. 3. Anyone who uses their phone is distracted. 4. Stephanie uses her phone. 5. Stephanie owns a Toyota. 6. A Toyota is a car Stephanie, T oyota constants Owns(x, y) predicate: x owns y Drive(x, y) predicate: x drives car y Distracted(x) predicate: x is distracted Accident(x) predicate: x has had an accident Car(x) predicate: x is a car U sesP hone(x) predicate: x uses their phone Table 3: FOL vocabulary (a) Using the vocabulary speciﬁed in Table 3, express these English statements in First- order Logic (FOL). (6) (b) Using your FOL statements, prove by resolution refutation that Stephanie was in an accident. (16) Proceed as follows: Convert the FOL statements to clausal form (CNF). Then show that these clauses, together with the clausal form of the negated goal, are unsatisﬁable. [TURN PAGE] 7 COS3751 October/November 2020 Question 6 Learning from Examples [19] Consider the following data in Table 4, comprised of three binary input attributes (A1, A2, and A3), and one binary output y: Example A1 A2 A3 y x1 1 0 0 0 x2 1 0 1 0 x3 0 1 0 0 x4 1 1 1 1 x5 1 1 0 1 Table 4: Data set (a) Using the principles of Information Gain build a decision tree for the data. Show the computations made to determine the attribute to split at each node. Use the table on page 8 for the entropy calculations. Also show the decision tree: branch and leaf nodes, as well as edges and appropriate labels for the edges.

The entropy for a number of data values E[x1, . . . , xn] is f ( x1 Σ )+. . .+f ( xn Σ ) where Σ = x1+. . .+xn. For example, given 4 instances of one value and 1 of another value for a particular attribute or decision, the entropy is E[4, 1] = f ( 4 5) + f ( 1 5) = f (0.80) + f (0.20) = 0.26 + 0.46 = 0.72. Note: Round to the closest r value in the table above. © UNISA 2020","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
