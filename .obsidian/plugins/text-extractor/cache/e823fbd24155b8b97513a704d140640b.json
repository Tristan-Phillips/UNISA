Pros of HTA required (2 marks) Cons of HTA required (2 marks). - Your discussion should include the pros and cons of HTA (This counted for 4 marks). - No discussion of HTA. Your discussion should include what Hierarchical Task Analysis is (1 mark) and the pros and cons of HTA (This counted for 4 marks). - No graphical representation. See memo for what your graphical representation of the task analysis for buying a DVD should look like. This counted 5 marks. Too little information given. Headings? Label for your diagram? 3.1 - No application to Unisa's LMS. You needed to give guidelines with an example of doing usability testing on Unisa's LMS for each guideline. - Give guidelines with an example of doing usability testing on Unisa's LMS for each guideline. - Further application of usability testing of Unisa's learning management system needs to be given for each guideline. - See the memo for the guidelines you needed to give, with required application to usability testing of Unisa's learning management system. - See the model solution for some other guidelines you could have given, with required application to usability testing of Unisa's learning management system. - What type of environment does usability testing take place in? - Tasks: Give examples of possible tasks users could perform on myUnisa, e.g. upload an assignment.| - Rather, when there is more than one way to conduct a certain task, participants could be asked to perform all of these in order to evaluate which one is the best or the fastest (1). Think of an example from myUnisa of different ways students can perform a specific task, e.g. different ways to contact an e-tutor. - Data collection methods you use when you perform usability testing? - Other data collection methods you use when you perform usability testing? - Interviews and questionnaires. - How will you collect the data? Other data collection methods can be used, such as interviews and questionnaires, and through observing student body language. - You need to think of how else you will receive user feedback besides interviews and questionnaires, such as through observing students body language and asking follow up questions when they express joy or frustration. 3.2. - See model solution for what needs to be incorporated in an ethical clearance application. - The focus is on applying for ethical clearance and what needs to be included in such an application. Your answer needs to include that your ethical clearance application will: clarify how the participants and the collected data will be treated (1) how the data will be analysed (1) and stored (1), how anonymity will be ensured (1). The above is an example of what needed to be included in your answer. - Before you do any of the above, you need to apply for ethical clearance from Unisa, for example. See model solution for what needs to be incorporated in an ethical clearance application. 4.1 - The question asks for the environment in which the evaluation is conducted in usability testing, experiments and field studies. Your answer gives no differentiation. - Breakdown your answer for 4.1 - 4.3 under the following headings: - Usability testing - Experiments - Field studies - What are you referring to here: usability testing, experiments or field studies? Experiments: The environment would be the laboratory or in the real-life world depending on the goals of the experiment. For example, a student computer lab at a university library. Usability testing -You need to be more specific and specify the number of users, e.g. 5 - 12 users. -Type of users? 4.2 - Type of participants need to be given for each. - Number of participants and type of participants need to be given for each. - Read your question carefully, to make sure you answer the question asked. - The question asks for the number and type of participants with respect to each of the following: usability testing, experiments and field studies. Your answer gives no differentiation. Usability Testing - You need to be more specific, e.g. 5 - 12 users is an acceptable number. - Typical users for which the system was designed. Experiments - Participants need to be selected carefully in order to avoid any bias. - Number of participants: Participants should be selected carefully to avoid any bias. - The question asks for the number and type of participants for experiments. Field Studies - Your answer needs to be more specific - may be 1 000's or even just one participant. - The correct answer is typical users or users who would not use the system. 4.3 - You need to compare usability testing, experiments and field studies with respect to the focus, scope and approach of usability testing. - The question asks for the focus, scope and approach of data collection with respect to each of the following: usability testing, experiments and field studies. Your answer gives no differentiation. - You need to elaborate and expand on your answers and give more information. - Field testing: Not questionnaires, rather data is captured through audio and video recording, taking field notes and filling diaries. Question 5 - Name of the myUnisa task you are evaluating? - Application to a possible problem on myUnisa? - Application to a specific example/problem on myUnisa is required for each heuristic. - The question would like you to identify possible problems on myUnisa. You need to be more critical in your answers. - Elaborate your answer with a specific example. - You need to elaborate your answers by giving specific examples from myUnisa. Questions that are not answered: - Question not answered General comments: - Question not answered in sufficient detail. - Too little information provided. Mark allocation will give you a good idea of the number of points you need to give. - Build onto your answer. Mark allocation will give you a good idea of the number of points you need to give. - Too little substantial information. - Insufficient information for the number of marks. - More information required for more marks. - No application - Apply your answers to myUnisa. - Application missing. - Read the question carefully. You have not answered the question correctly. Advice to give to students: - Read the question carefully and only answer the question that is asked. Write out the question before your answer so that you can check that you have answered the question. - Give the necessary headings when you answer the question and answer EACH part of the question. - If the question asks you to apply your answer to a specific case, read the case and give the required application. - Do your best to answer all the questions, as you will lose marks if you do not answer all the questions. - Take note of the mark allocation, and match that with how much information you give. - Label your diagram, so the marker knows what your diagram refers too. - You need to answer each part of the question asked and give the necessary headings and labels for diagrams asked. Feedback: - Question 2.1: Many students did not give a use case diagram. - Students leave out parts of the question asked - Questions 2.1 and 2.2; Question 4 - Question 2.2: Few (3 in total) students gave the pros and cons of HTA. - Question 5: Many students did not give the Unisa task they were evaluating - Observation that students battle to apply their answers to a case. - Students should avoid leaving blank spaces, they should attempt all questions even in the exam. - Students should read questions very carefully before they start answering.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
