Discuss how you would apply the following principles when designing the ITS app. (15 marks) Principle Description (3 marks each) Visibility The more visible a function is, the easier it would be to find that function and know how to use it. This can be implemented by making the most used functions the most visible. An example of this would be opening the application in a window where the most recent chats are at the top of the list and another example is making the “send” button larger than the other buttons in a chat. Question 2 45 marks Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace 5 INF3720 JUN/JULY [Turn over] Feedback This is about sending back information about actions that have been done and what has been accomplished. This can be done by allowing the user to easily view the status of his/her message. An example of doing this would be to use a system similar to the one used in WhatsApp where a single dot means sent, a doable dot means sent and a line means message read. Constraints This is about restricting the types of actions that users can take at under certain conditions. This can be done by not allowing users to send messages in certain chats that are there just to receive announcements from tutors. An example of this would be to stop the keyboard from popping up when those chats are opened and by removing the send button etc. Consistency This refers to using similar actions to perform similar tasks, as opposed to having similar tasks use wildly different actions to access them making the interface unintuitive and confusing. This can be done in one way by having the settings button in the same place all the time. An implementation of this would be to have the settings button on the top right of the main page to access the main settings and by having the chat settings on the top right of the chat page. Affordance This refers to attributes of objects that allow users to know how to use it just by looking at it. This can be done by making the send button obvious to use. An example of this would be by making the send button larger, a different colour and by adding a symbol (like a letter or arrow) on it that indicates its function.

Identify at least 5 valid points and record them in the table below. (10 marks) Description of the point (2 marks per valid point) 1 Developers gain a good understanding of user requirements 2 Ensures that the final product is usable to the end users 3 Manages the users’ expectations of the product 4 Users are more likely to support the product because of feelings of ownership due to involvement 5 Ensures a more efficient development process where little backtracking due to useless ideas takes place Question 2.5 During the design of the ITS app, how would you manage the expectations and ownership of the product by the stakeholders? Provide your answer in point form in the table below. (10 marks) Point Description (2 marks per valid point) 1 Involve stakeholders in the design process 2 Adequate and timely training before the product is released 3 Clarify the expectations of the stakeholders so that everyone understands the requirements (use focus groups) 4 Provide regular updates throughout the development process 5 Host regular meetings with stakeholders to assess their satisfaction Question 3.1 What do you understand by the term \"emotional interaction\"? (2 marks) Emotional interaction is concerned with what makes people feel various emotions and using that information to design user experiences. Question 3.2 From the components of the Anthony Ortony et al.

Visceral This refers to making a product look, feel and sound good. This is done by using bright colours and wild designs. 2. Behavioural This refers to the usability of a product. This is achieved by its affordances of use and a system that is widely used by other watches. 3. Reflective This refers to the meaning and personal value of the product in a certain culture. This is achieved by using cultural imagery that reflect the environments that teenage girls regularly interact with. 3.3 You want to buy the above watch for your teenager. Assume that the watch has sports functions, including measuring heart rate and recording sport activities. You are concerned about the usability of the watch. List any four usability questions that you would ask before buying the watch in the following table? (8 marks) Usability questions 1. How clearly is the heart rate and sport information displayed? 2. How comfortable is the watch? 3. How accurate is the heart rate monitor? 4 How long does the battery last?

Effectiveness - How good a product is at doing what it is supposed to do. Efficiency - The way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks. Safety - Protecting users from dangerous conditions / undesirable situations. Utility -refers to the extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to do Learnability - how easy a system is to learn to use. It is well known that people do not like spending a long time learning how to use a system. Usability goal Evaluation of music App a Effectiveness Navigation on music app can be a bit clumsy/cumber stone: The user must go back to search button to see other songs on the list b Safety The app prevents the user to making serious errors, or to recover from one c Utility The music apps enable the user to do and submit d Learnability After downloading the music app, a first-time user can easily start using the app e Memorability since music Apps follows a standardised format and structure for all modules, it is quite easy to remember how to use the system for other modules once you have learned how to use it for one module QUESTION 2 (Assume that you have been asked to plan the lifecycle of the interactive design for a local town’s electronic library system. 2.1 List and explain three basic but essential activities of interaction design. a) Discovering/establishing requirements: the kind of support an interactive product should provide to the target users b) Designing alternatives: exploring different alternative activities to meet the requirements, e.g. conceptual design, and concrete design options c) Prototyping (the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed); paper-based prototypes/models; a basic piece of software; role-playing using a model) d) Evaluating: determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design with a high level of user involvement.

QUESTION 3.1 Discuss the purpose of conceptual models. A conceptual model is a simplified description of a system that describes how it works – it is intended to articulate the problem and design space in interaction design OR a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates / an abstraction of what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it / enables designers to clarify their thinking before designing the software tools / provides a working strategy and a framework of concepts and their interrelations. 3.2 Discuss the core components of conceptual models. 1. Metaphors and analogies A figure of speech/comparison that convey to people to understand what a software product is used for and how it should be used 2. Concepts to which people are exposed through the proposed product Task-domain objects which users create and manipulate, their attributes, and possible operations. 3. Relationships between those concepts for instance, whether one object contains another When the user clicks or taps on the herald, linked neighbours are informed too. 4. Mappings between the concepts and the UX the product is designed support or invoke For instance, revisiting a page through looking at a list of visited sites, most-frequently visited, or saved websites The user can easily browse to a daily schedule of all eight possible load shedding phases for the area where he/she currently is/will be (linking current location, day and time with schedules and phases per area) – thus providing a user- friendly and effective interface and a positive UX. This solves users’ need to when load shedding will occur to plan their daily activities around it. 3.3 Apply the core components of conceptual models to a typical music streaming application. Metaphors and analogies-The music App must use a (analogy/metaphor), i.e. it must have an easier, user- friendly way to inform users e.g. The Music App provides short snippets of useful information. This appears on and moves across the screen in the way people would expect a real card to do—in a lightweight, paper-based sort of way. The concepts to which people are exposed through the product- The music app has an option/button and make a trumpet sound whenever a new notification is pushed to the user’s phone. The relationships between those concepts- Mappings between the concepts and the UX the product is designed support or invoke- The user can easily browse to any type of music they prefer from hip pop, gospels, old school , jazz – thus providing a user- friendly and effective interface and a positive UX. This solves users’ need because all music genre is on one app. This study source was downloaded by 100000799301222 from CourseHero.com on 11-05-2021 15:12:11 GMT -05:00 https://www.coursehero.com/file/86478702/INF3720-exam-2020-60878525pdf/ This study resource was shared via CourseHero.com Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace QUESTION 4 Assume that you have been hired by a company that produces fitness trackers. You have to propose ways to create a satisfying experience for users of a new fitness-tracking device. 4.1 Positive design elements / pleasurable interfaces 4.2 Possible implementations of positive design elements for a new fitness tracker a Design at the behavioural level (good usability) and reflective level (product has meaning and personal value for the user) (good usability) and reflective level (product has meaning and personal value for the user) b Feedback-level Expressive interfaces communicate status of a system efficiently to provide reassuring feedback c Persuasive level Anthropomorphism – simulating human attributes to make technology more fun simulating animal attributes to motivate people or to put them in a good mood.

What are the services do you expect? What do you think about E reading book? Can you tell us about your experience when using E reading book reader? Which age do you think should read from e-books? QUESTION 6 (10) Assume that you have been contracted by Unisa to do a usability testing of its online registration system. Explain which measures you will put in place to ensure that the participants’ rights are protected. a) Usability testing in a controlled setting reduces outside influences and distractions. online registration system – this will allow me to observe certain behaviours b) Other data collection methods can be used, such as interviews and questionnaires I will confirm my observations and analysis using structured interviews with a second group of Students who should also be using online registration system themselves c) Users are required to perform typical tasks to test whether the system does what it is supposed to – I will ask users to do interval training of submitting assignments while evaluating how efficient the online registration system tracker/system tracks online assignments d) Users’ reactions to the interactive product can reveal usability issues that could be missed in other experiments and reports– I will ask a team of students to observe the online registration system and to ask to follow up questions when they express joy or frustration while using online registration system e) When there is more than one way to conduct a certain task, participants could be asked to perform all of these to evaluate which one is the best or the fastest. I will ask the students to use three various kinds online to measure online registration system accuracy for the various types to adjust the algorithm where necessary. 7.1 List five of the ten Nielsen heuristics (usability principles) that can be used to do a usability inspection of user interfaces. • Visibility of system status • Match between system and the real world • User control and freedom • Consistency and standards • Error prevention • Recognition rather than recall • Flexibility and efficiency of use This study source was downloaded by 100000799301222 from CourseHero.com on 11-05-2021 15:12:11 GMT -05:00 https://www.coursehero.com/file/86478702/INF3720-exam-2020-60878525pdf/ This study resource was shared via CourseHero.com Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace • Aesthetic and minimalist design. 7.2 Formulate one question that could be asked to test whether the interface of the Unisa library system conforms to these tried and tested heuristics. 7.1 Heuristic 7.2 Questions that could be asked to test whether the interface of the Unisa library system conforms to these heuristics. a Help and Documentation Through the Unisa library system are you able to easily search assignments, modules, additional materials? b Aesthetic and Minimalist Design The students are they able to check c Recognition Rather Than Recall Are the instructions visible or easily retrievable d Error Prevention Are there any confirmation options e 3.User control and freedom The re do buttons are they available on the Unisa library system when a student select a wrong book?

Navigation on myUnisa can be a bit clumsy/cumbersome: a user has to go back to the topic list in Discussions to see other items (the forward arrows do not work) Safety - Protecting users from dangerous conditions / undesirable situations. e.g. Prevent users from making serious errors - by not putting Delete / Quit menu option next to Save option. Use of confirmation dialogue boxes, Undo facilities. mention how myUnisa prevents a student from making a serious error, or to recover from one Utility - Extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to do mention how myUnisa enables students to do and submit assignments Learnability - How easy a system is to learn to use. a first-year student can easily start using myUnisa and do not need training since the software is intuitive to use Memorability - How easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned. Since myUnisa follows a standardized format and structure for all modules, it is quite easy to remember how to use the system for other modules once you have learned how to use it for one module. Question 2 2.1) Understand and conceptualize what is currently the user experience/product and how this is going to be improved or changed. 2.2) Conceptual space involves articulating the proposed solution as a conceptual model with respect to the user experience. 2.3) Anthropomorphism is the propensity people have to attribute human qualities to animals and objects. For example, people sometimes talk to their computers as if they were humans 2.4) Paradigm refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work in terms of shared asumptions, concepts, values, and practices.

Question 6 0. In order to buy a DVD 1. locate DVD 2. add DVD to shopping basket 3. enter payment details 4. complete address 5. confirm order Question 7 a. Field studies are done in natural settings. My smartphone adjusts its brightness using my preferred setting and the level of light; however, I still have to adjust it manually sometimes and this can be annoying. b. Studies in natural settings can be messy; activities can overlap or be interrupted. I have evaluated my phone’s interface by making calls, texting and browsing at home, at the office and in a restaurant. I have found that WhatsApp pop-ups can be very annoying and cause me to send replies to the wrong recipients, especially if I am interrupted by other inputs such as telephone calls. c. Field studies can range in time (minutes to years). My evaluation was done in the first week after I upgraded my phone, but it can be repeated after a few months to compare my experience of the interface. d. Field studies can be used to study appropriation of technologies. I have found that I prefer to use apps that speak to local circumstances, such as apps that provide load shedding updates, election results or COVID-19 stats in SA. e. Since I have evaluated my own phone, issues of ensuring privacy and telling people about their rights were not relevant, but these are important if other people are involved in the field test, e.g. participants should be informed that they have a right to withdraw at any time.

Users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product’s development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership toward it and support its use. 1.2) The key strength of brainstorming during requirements gathering is generating alternative ideas that are key in interaction design. 1.3)  Orientation – enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the target users.  Open mindedness – preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focused early on.  Common ground – allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on. Once formulated and agreed upon, a conceptual model can then become a shared blueprint. 1.4)  Continuous representation of the objects and actions of interest.  Rapid reversible incremental actions with immediate feedback about the object of interest.  Physical actions and button pressing instead of issuing commands with complex syntax. 1.5)  As a way of conceptualizing what we are doing (for instance, surfing the web).  As a conceptual model instantiated at the interface level (for example, the card metaphor).  As a way of visualizing an operation (such as an icon of a shopping cart into which items are placed that users want to purchase on an online shopping site. 1.6) This study source was downloaded by 100000799301222 from CourseHero.com on 11-05-2021 15:02:16 GMT -05:00 https://www.coursehero.com/file/69171519/INF3720-MAY-2019-Memodocx/ This study resource was shared via CourseHero.com Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Question 2 Persuasive technologies are technologies designed to change people’s attitude or behavior or both without using coercion or deception. The currently, the technologies include pop-ups, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, etc. Persuasive strategies include: Just in time persuasion, Simulating experience, Personalizing, Recommendation, Monitoring and tracking, Competition, and recognition  Just in time persuasion. Amazon’s one click mechanism  Recommendation. Other customers who bought this book also bought  Personalizing. Receiving mail on other books with similar content on one which you’ve bought  Monitoring and Tracking. Monitor sites you’ve been to and track you using cookies and provide you pop-ups, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages  Simulating experience: There is an app that is called HIV roulette in which the user chooses people that they might interact with. You then spin the roulette wheel and the system informs you of the possibility of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.  Competition and recognition: Fitbits also use competition and recognition persuasion techniques to compete against friends and your personal best and recognizes good behavior.  Visualizing the personalities When systems put users into certain demographic groups and feed them advertising Question 3 3.1) Design principles are used by interaction designers to aid their thinking when designing for the user experience. These are generalizable abstractions intended to orient designers towards thinking about different aspects of their designs. 3.2) 1. Visibility: The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to do next. 2. Feedback: Involves sending back information about what action has been done, and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. 3. Constraints: Refers to determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. 4. Consistency: Refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. Benefit of consistent interfaces are that it is easier to learn to use. 5. Affordance: A term used to refer to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. E.g. door handle affords pulling. Mouse button affords pushing. 3.3) Simplicity is very important in that an interface that is too busy detracts from the message or actual content it is purposed for. Clean lines, a good balance of white space, well written text, well balanced graphics are all important. And if a website works well without an element, I do agree even though it might be hard to do. One must just ensure that the website is not left too bland, with only text and nothing aesthetically pleasing. An elegant design has a good balance between what is on the page and what is not 3.4) 1. Users’ tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development. While technology will inform design options and choices, it is not the driving force. Instead of saying “Where can we deploy this new technology?” say “What technologies are available to provide better support for users’ goals?” 2. Users’ behavior and context of use are studied, and the system is designed to support them. This is not just about capturing users’ tasks and goals. How people perform their tasks is also significant. Understanding behavior highlights priorities, preferences, and implicit intentions. 3. Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for. When things go wrong with technology, people often think it is their fault. People are prone to making errors and have certain limitations, both cognitive and physical. Products designed to support people should take these limitations into account and try to prevent mistakes from being made. Some characteristics are general, such as color blindness but some characteristics are associated with a particular job or task. In addition to general characteristics, those traits specific to the intended user group also need to be captured.

Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to the latest. As discussed earlier, there are different levels of user involvement, and there are different ways in which to consult users. 5. All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their activities, and their environment. This does not necessarily mean that users are actively involved in design decisions, but that is one option. Question 4 4.1) a. Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Novice to expert differences, age ranges, disabilities, and technological diversity each enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices, such as explanations, and features for experts, such as shortcuts and faster pacing, can enrich the interface design and improve perceived system quality. b. As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data-entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name- address block. c. Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions. They don't want surprises or changes in familiar behavior, and they are annoyed by tedious data-entry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary information, and inability to produce their desired result. d. Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to prepare for the next group of actions. For example, e-commerce websites move users from selecting products to the checkout, ending with a clear confirmation page that completes the transaction. 4.2) a. In laboratory usability testing, the environment and user activity is controlled in order to test hypotheses and measure or observe certain behavior. There may be a list of tasks and operations for the users to try out in order to get a complete evaluation of the product features. In field studies, there is little or no control of users’ activities in order to determine how the product would be used in natural settings in the real world. It is messy in the sense that activities tend to overlap and there are constant interruptions. b. In both settings, appropriate groups of typical users from the target audience would participate in the evaluation, i.e. the users for whom the system is designed. In lab-based studies, the participants would be brought into the lab separately and asked to perform predefined tasks. Field studies may be short or take place over months, in a natural environment where it is up to the participants to decide how to use the product and when. c. In usability testing data is collected from conducting experiments for certain predefined scenarios through observation of participants. They may be recorded on video and audio as they perform tasks. Data captured includes facial expressions and body language. Participants may be asked to speak out loud so that what they are thinking, and planning can be revealed and recorded. Interactions with the software may also be recorded by logging software, such as keystroke loggers and mouse movements recorders. After the session, structured or semi-structured interviews are conducted to elicit participants’ opinions about how they found the experience. Questionnaires are also used, where participants can rate things along a number of scales. In field studies, data is collected about how the product is being used in work or other environments. Data is in the form of events and conversations, recorded by researchers as notes and audio or video recordings, or by participants as diaries and notes. Some examples include recording the frequency of daily activities, such as eating and drinking habits, or social interactions like phone and face-to-face conversations. Software running on smartphones could trigger messages to participants at certain intervals, requesting them to answer or fill out forms and checklists. Data can also be recorded from intermittent interviews with participants.

This is one of the principles that make it easy and useful to use a computer system. Name and explain the five sub-principles that explain the meaning of the above statement (10 marks) a. Users’ tasks and goals are the driving force behind development. In a user-centered approach to design, while technology will inform design options and choices, it should not be the driving force. b. Users’ behaviour and context of use are studied, and the system is designed to support them. This is about more than just capturing the tasks and users’ goals. How people perform their tasks is also significant. Understanding behaviour highlights priorities, preferences and implicit intentions. c. Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for. Products designed to support humans should take limitations like human error into account and should limit the mistakes they make. d. Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account. e. All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work and their environment. Does not necessarily mean that users are actively involved in design. Designers just need to remain aware of users while making their decisions. (may/jun2017 Q5.2) How would you apply the five sub principles in improving the MyUnisa system (5 marks) Question 2 2.1 What is the strength of using brainstorming in interaction design during the requirements gathering stage? (2 marks) The key strength of brainstorming during requirements gathering is generating alternative ideas that are key in interaction design. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace 2.2 List any five recommended rules that need to be followed for a requirements gathering brainstorming session to be a success. (10 marks) 1. Include participants from a wide range of disciplines, with a broad range of experience. 2. Don’t ban silly stuff. Wild ideas often turn into really useful requirements. 3. Use catalysts for further inspiration. Build one idea on top of another. 4. Keep records. Every idea to be captured without censoring. Number ideas for easy reference. Walls and tables in the room to be covered with paper and participants to be encouraged to sketch, mind-map and diagram ideas, including keeping the flow of ideas, as special memory is very strong and this can facilitate recall. 5. Sharpen the focus. Start brainstorming with well-honed problem. 6. Use warm-up exercises and make session fun. Group will require warm-up if they have not worked together before. Question 3 3.1 Briefly describe any three usability goals that would guide your usability testing (6 marks) p457 Primary goal is to determine whether an interface is usable by the intended user population to carry out the tasks for which it was designed. User satisfaction questionnaires and interviews can also be used to elicit users’ opinions about how they found the experience of using the system. Optimal performance levels and minimal levels of acceptance are generally specified and current levels noted 3.2 If you are to evaluate the website in a usability lab, how many participants would you invite? Justify your answer (2 marks) p475 Five to twelve participants is considered an acceptable number. 3.3 Which data capturing methods would you use to collect data from the participants when carrying out the test in a usability laboratory? (3 marks) p476 Typically video cameras will record users’ behaviour, such as movements and facial expression, and general body language. Microphones are also placed near where the participants will be sitting to record their utterances. The observation room with a one way mirror, so that evaluators can watch participants being tested but testers cannot see them. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace 3.4 What are the disadvantages of carrying out the evaluation in a laboratory? (4 marks) Usability labs can be very expensive and labour-intensive to run and maintain. Modifications would need to be made to these labs on a regular basis when new products or systems are tested, and can be time-consuming. 3.5 If you were to use heuristic evaluation, discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation. (6 marks) 1. The briefing session: experts are told what to do. A prepared script is useful as a guide and to ensure each person receives the same briefing. 2. The evaluation period, in which each expert typically spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. They need to take at least 2 passes through the interface. Pass one gives a feel for the flow of the interaction and the product’s scope. Pass two allows the evaluator to focus on specific interface elements in the context of the whole product, and to identify potential usability problems. 3. The debriefing session, in which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solution. The heuristics focus on the evaluators’ attention on particular issues, so selecting appropriate heuristics is critically important. Question 4 4.1 What do you understand by the term conceptual model? (2 marks)  Is a high-level description of how a system is organised and operates.  It outlines what users can do with it and the concepts they need in order to understand how to interact with it. 4.2 What are the benefits of conceptualizing the design space? (6 marks) 1. Orientation – enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the target users. 2. Open mindedness – preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focussed early on. 3. Common ground – allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Once formulated and agreed upon, a conceptual model can then become a shared blueprint. 4.3 Why are interface metaphors important in interaction design? (2 marks) 45 Interface Metaphors are intended to provide familiar entities that enable people to readily understand the underlying conceptual model and know what to do at an interface. Question 5 5.1 What is emotional interaction and what does it entail (3 marks) 133 It is about considering what makes us happy, sad, annoyed, anxious frustrated, motivated, etc. and using this knowledge to inform the design of different aspects of the user experience. 5.2 What are the three levels of Ortony et al (2005) Model of Emotional design? Define and briefly discuss how each level of the model informs the design of a product. Give examples in your discussion. (15 marks) 136 At the lowest level, there is the visceral level. This includes parts of the brain that are pre-wired to automatically respond to events. Responds rapidly, making judgements about what is good/bad, safe/dangerous, pleasure/abhorrent. It also triggers emotional responses to stimuli that are expressed through a combination of physiological and behavioural responses. Behavioural level: includes the brain processes that control our everyday behaviour. This is where most human activities occur. E.g. well-learned routine operations such as talking, typing and driving. Reflective level is the highest level. It includes brain processes that contemplate. It entails conscious thought where people generalise across events or step back from routine and the immediate. 5.3 Young children who cannot read nor write have been observed to have an interest in using or playing with mobile device based applications. Given their interest, it is valuable that interaction designers focus on designing applications that are usable by this group of children. In this respect, as an interaction designer, briefly describe Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace the main interaction types that you would recommend for the design of an interactive game for young children who can neither read nor write (9 marks) 48 Interaction types: 1. Instructing – where users issue instructions to a system like typing in commands, selecting options from menu’s etc. 2. Conversing – where users have a dialog with the system. Users can speak via an interface or type in questions to which a system replies in speech or text. 3. Manipulating – where users interact with objects in virtual space. 4. Exploring – where users move through a virtual environment. Question 6 6.1 What are environmental requirements? (2 marks) 353 Environmental requirements refer to circumstances in which the interactive product will operate. There are four aspects of environmental requirements that need to be considered when establishing requirements. 6.2 Briefly discuss four aspects of environment that should be considered when establishing requirements? (8 marks) 1. Physical Environment – such as how much lighting, noise, movement, and dust is expected in the operational environment. 2. Social Environment – e.g. collaboration and coordination to be expected. 3. Organisational Environment – e.g. how good is the user support likely to be, and how easily can it be obtained. 4. Technical Environment 6.3 Which aspects of user characteristics affect the capturing of software requirements? (5 marks) User characteristics capture key attributes of the intended user group, user abilities and skills. The characteristics that affect design is nationality, Education background, preferences, personal circumstances, physical or mental disability, etc. 6.4 What are the five advantages of involving users during software development? (5 marks) 1. Improved quality of systems arising from more accurate capture of user requirements. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace 2. To avoid incorporation of costly unnecessary system features that users will not want to use. 3. To provide users with a system that meets real expectation. 4. Ensure that users do not encounter surprises when the new system is delivered. 5. Greater understanding of systems by users results in more effective use. 6. Increased participation in decision making within software development cycle increases ownership of system by users. 7. If users are involved, they will have a chance to work with the product before it is released, and they will have a better understanding of what to expect on the new system.

Examples are icons and animations used to indicate the current state of a PC when it is waking up or being rebooted. Annoying Interfaces: Interfaces, if designed poorly can make people look stupid, or feel insulted or threatened. The effect can be to make them annoyed. Many situations that cause such emotional responses include: * When an app doesn’t work properly or crashes. * When a system does not do what user wants it to do. * When user expectations are not met. Persuasive technology: Interactive computer systems that are deliberately designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviours. 1.2 List any five usability goals? (5 marks) 1. Effectiveness to use 2. Efficiency to use 3. Safe to use. 4. Having good utility 5 Learnability 6. Memorability. 1.3 List any five undesirable aspects of user experience (5 marks) Annoying Boring Childish Cutesy Frustrating Patronising Unpleasant. Desirable Challenging Fun Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Satisfying Rewarding Engaging Entertaining Motivating Pleasurable. Helpful Enjoyable 1.4 There is a fine line between an interaction that works and an interaction that is usable. Designing interactions that work and are usable is achievable if design principles are appropriately applied. Discuss the five design principles that guide interaction design. (10 marks) 1. Visibility: The more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know what to do next. 2. Feedback: Involves sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. 3. Constraints: The design concept of constraints refers to determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at any given moment. 4. Consistency: Designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. 5. Affordance: There are two types, perceived and real. It is a term used to refer to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it, e.g. mouse buttons invite you to press them. Question 4 4.2 Shneiderman’s eight golden rules are used as heuristics for identifying usability problems, discuss the four selected rules: a. Cater for universal usability (3 marks) Recognise the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Novice to expert differences, age ranges, disabilities, and technological diversity each enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices, such as explanations, and features for experts, such as shortcuts and faster pacing, can enrich the interface design and improve perceived system quality. b. Permit easy reversal of actions (3 marks) Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data-entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name-address block. c. Support internal locus of control (3 marks) Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions. They don't want surprises or changes in familiar behaviour, and they are annoyed by tedious data-entry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary information, and inability to produce their desired result. d. Design dialogues to yield closure (3 marks) Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to prepare for the next group of actions. For example, e-commerce websites move users from selecting products to the checkout, ending with a clear confirmation page that completes the transaction. e. Offer informative feedback (3 marks) For every user action there should be system feedback. a. Strive for consistency Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations. E.g. terminology, menus, help screens, colour, layout, fonts, etc. b. Reduce short-term memory load We can remember ‘7 plus or minus 2 chunks’ of information. Avoid interfaces in which uses must remember information from one screen and then use that info on another screen. c. Prevent errors Design the system such that the user cannot make serious errors. E.g. grey out menu items that are not appropriate, and not allowing alphabetic chars in a numeric sequence.

Icons and animations have been used to convey the current state of a computer. e.g. The apple icon which showed a computer happy face when the system booted up and a sad face if something wasn’t right. Other ways of conveying the system status is by using vibro-tactile feedback indicating a message or a change. Voice feedback such as a GPS navigation system informing users where to turn. Dynamic icons like the recycle bin being emptied or the sound of a file closing with a swoosh sound. The arrangement of fonts, shapes, line etc can also elicit certain feelings of ease. Annoying interfaces: Annoying interfaces are those interfaces that illicit negative emotions such as anger and disgust. Interfaces that crash and don’t work properly, ones that don’t do what the user wants them to do, Vague error messages, help that doesn’t help, Doesn’t meet user expectations. Cutsey, garish and gimmicky interfaces. Webpages which are with text and graphics making it difficult to find information. Flashing ads, moving banners, animations which require the user to close them. Featuritis – an excessive number of operations, such as the array of buttons on remote controls. Poorly laid out keyboards, pads, control panels, and other input devices that cause users to persistently press the wrong keys or buttons. persuasive technology: A diversity of technologies is increasingly being used to draw people's attention to certain kinds of information in an attempt to change what they do or think. Pop-up ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, and recommendations are some of the methods that are being deployed on computer screens. interactive computing systems are deliberately designed to change people's attitudes and behaviors. More recently, interactive techniques have been used to entice, cajole, and persuade people to do something they might not have otherwise done. Successful examples include Amazon's one-click mechanism that makes it so easy and tempting to buy something at their online store, and recommender systems that suggest specific books, hotels, restaurants, etc a reader might want to try based on their previous purchases, choices, and taste. Splash pages to online shopping sites and color images of gorgeous-looking beach and mountain scenes on travel sites are designed to lure people into making impulse purchases. In addition to using interactive technologies as a more targeted and personalized form of advertising, they can be used to change people's behaviors in non- commercial domains, such as safety, preventative healthcare, fitness, personal relationships, energy consumption, and learning. Here, the emphasis is on changing habits or doing something that will improve an individual's well-being through monitoring their behavior. 1.2 How Can the design of a technology change the attitude and behaviour of people (11 marks) A well designed product that provides the user with a feeling of ease, comfort and happiness is often times perceived by the user as having good utility. The style of an interface, in terms of the shapes, fonts, colors, balance, white space, and graphical elements that are used and the way they are combined, can also influence its emotional impact. Use of imagery at the interface can result in more engaging and enjoyable experiences The design of aesthetically pleasing interfaces has become of central concern to interaction design. Empirical studies have shown that the aesthetics of an interface can have a positive effect on people's perception of the system's usability. When the look and feel of an interface is pleasing and pleasurable – e.g. beautiful graphics, nice feel to the way the elements have been put together, well-designed fonts, elegant use of images and color, a good sense of balance – users are likely to be more tolerant. Good design that is effective, easy to learn and provides a good user experience makes users feeling happy and provides good utility. Users might be enticed to take the stairs rather than the elevator because of a design that encourages users to use the stairs. Children may learn how to look after a pet by having to look after a robotic pet. People may reduce their energy consumption, reduce their water usage, be fitter, learn more skills and be more social able if the product is designed well.

These principals are not prescriptive yet, they serve as tested methods for designing products that are Easy to learn, Effective to user and provide a good user experience. They also minimise costly mistakes. 3.2 List five design principles that are concerned with how to determine what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an Interactive product according to Prcece et al (2015) (5 marks) Feedback Visibility Affordance Constraints Consistency 3.3 One of the mam design principles for website design IS simplicity Nielsen proposed that designers go through all their design elements and remove them one by one If a design works Just well without an element, then Just remove It Do you think this IS a good design principle Discuss (6 marks) Simplicity is very important in that an interface that is too busy detracts from the message or actual content it is purposed for. Clean lines, a good balance of white space, well written text, well balanced graphics are all important. And if a website works well without an element I do agree even though it might be hard to do. One must just ensure that the website is not left too bland, with only text and nothing aesthetically pleasing. An elegant design has a good balance between what is on the page and what is not. 4 Question 4 [25 marks] 4.1 Which are the five key Issues that require attention for any data gathering session to become successful (10 marks)  Setting goals: Without a predefined goal of what the data gathering technique is supposed to accomplish, one cannot effectively identify what is the best method to gather data, who are the participants and what data analysis to perform.  identify the participants: Based on the goal of data gathering, a population of users who fit the profile of what information needs to be gleaned is established.  Relationship with the participants: The relationships with participants needs to needs to be clear cut and professional to clarify the nature of the study. It might helpful to provide a consent form to establish for participants to complete. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  Triangulation: Involves get different perspectives either by employing different theories, methodologies, different users, different evaluators.  Pilot Studies: A pilot studies is a pre-run of the data gathering exercise. This establish if there are any flaws in the data extraction method and rectify before going ‘live’. 4.2 What should be avoided when designing interview questions' (5 marks) Avoid using compound sentences. Use simple sentences. Avoid using Jargon and rather opt for laymans terms Avoid questions that create biased answers Avoid asking questions in an illogical order Avoid using probing questions in the beginning. Do not expect interview questions to directly answer your research aim. Interview questions should follow some order. Do not ask abrupt questions Avoid questions that are not related to interview goals. The type of data recording should not interfere with the interview proceeding 4.3 Discuss any five advantages of Involving users during software development (10 marks)  Understanding of user goals and pain points: Developers gain a better understanding of user’s goals  A more appropriate product more usable products are developed. The user is the one who interacts with the system every day  Expectation Management: User’s expectaions are managed if they are involved. They will understand the limitations of the system as well as what the system can do when deployed. Under promise / over deliver.  Training can also be minimised. A user will already be familiarised with the product and how . the system will be used and affect their jobs.  Ownership: User’s that take ownership of the product by being involved in it are more likely to adopt the use thereof.  Cost saving: Reducing costs of patches and redesigning when expectations haven’t been met. 5 Question 5 [18 marks] Heuristic evaluation IS an Informal usability Inspection technique developed by Nielson and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure or on- line help conform to the principles Discuss heuristic evaluation under the following headings 5.1 Briefly discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation (6 marks) Briefing: Evaluators are briefed as to the purpose of the evaluation, whether is it for a whole system, a portion of the system or a dialog. It is advisable to provide a script to all the evaluators so that each evaluator does the evaluation in the same order and the evaluation has been done consistently. Evaluation: Each evaluator takes about 1 – 2 hours to complete the evaluations and 2 passes through the system. The first is a general overview and the second is more precise looking for usability problems. Debriefing: In which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings, prioritise problems and suggest possible solutions.

Users have varying needs, the context where users use products, their access to facilities, whether they are novice users or advanced users, varying technological diversity. Adding features for novices and say shortcuts for expert users can enrich perceived system quality. 5.2.2 Permit easy reversal of actions (3 marks) Reversal of actions can be for one character, one action, one database entry or a group of functions. Creating undo/redo options creates a feeling of ease and enables users to further explore the system because of the security that undo or redo provides. 5.2.3 Support Internal locus (3 marks) Internal locus focuses on the systems abilities to enable users to do what they want to do. In other words, the user is empowered to changes settings, customise layouts and perform advanced tasks. 5.2.4 Design dialogues to Yield closure (3 marks) Each sequence of actions has a beginning, middle and an end. When a group of actions is done, the user feel satisfaction at having achieved their goals, relief that the action has been done, no need to follow any contingency plans and the ability to start working on the next group of actions.

They are intended to help designers explain and improve their designs. They act like triggers to ensure that designers have provided certain features in an interface. They provide a framework for what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks. The provide the dos and don’ts of interaction. 1.2 List five design Principles that are concerned with how to determine what users should see and do when carrying their task when using an interactive product according to Preece et al (2015) (5 Marks) Affordance: Know how to use an object. Press on whatsapp, go the telephone to make a call. click, scroll. Scroll bars, icons, buttons, keypads have become part of our everyday affordances. Feedback: Visual, Audio, vibrotactile, tactile, verbal or combo. Typing on a whatsapp message Visibility: Visibilility of applications, You can see when whatsapp has new messages. Constraints: Login screens, size of a cell phone. Consistency: each cell phone works consistently. Typing a message via whatsapp or through SMS works the same. makes it easier to learn. 1.3 One of the main design principles for website design is simplicity. Nelsen propose that designers go through all their design elements and remove them ne by one. If a design works well without an element, then just remove it. Do you think this is a good design principle? Discuss. (5) I think it is a good design principle in order to learn what simplicity means. A website with too much content, too many graphics, too many colours can be very off-putting resulting in too much stimuli. However, a good designer might remove all the design elements as a learning experience. However, he will learn to find a balance between simplicity and a good overall design. A website with a plain vanilla background and loads of text is also not good. The goal here is to create a website that is crisp, clean, provides a good experience and where the user is able to easily find the information they want. 2 Question 2 2.1 Briefly explain each of the following terms as they usability, framework, conceptual model as they relate to human computer interaction. 2.1.1 Usability Refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective, enjoy able from the users’ perspective. Usability goals are : Memorability Utility Learnability Effective Effeciency Safety Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Page 2 of 6 2.1.2 Framework (pg54) A framework is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions - Frameworks tend to be prescriptive, providing designers with concepts, questions, and principles to consider 2.1.3 Conceptual Model(Pg41) A high level description of how a system is organised and operates. An abstraction of what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. 2.2 Discuss the core components of a conceptual model 2.2.1 Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity (e.g.browsing, bookmarking). 2.2.2 The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task–domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them (e.g. saving, revisiting, organizing). 2.2.3 The relationships between those concepts (e.g. whether one object contains another, the relative importance of actions to others, and whether an object is part of another). 2.2.4 The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (e.g. one can revisit through looking at a list of visited sites, most-frequently visited, or saved websites). 2.3 In which three ways can metaphors and analogies be applied to conceptual design 2.3.1 As a way of conceptualising what we are doing. 2.3.2 As a conceptual model instantiated at the interface 2.3.3 As a way of visualising an operation Not sure of this one. 3 Question 3 3.1 Explain what is meant by Persuasive Technology. Persuasive technologies are technologies designed to change people’s attitude or behaviour or both without using coercion or deception. The currently, the technologies include pop-ups, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, etc. Persuasive strategies include: Just in time persuasion, Simulating experience, Personalizing, Recommendation, Monitoring and tracking, Competition and recognition 3.2 Give any example of Persuasion Just in time persuasion. Amazon’s one click mechanism Recommendation. Other customers who bought this book also bought Personalizing. Receiving mail on other books with similar content on one which you’ve bought Monitoring and Tracking. Monitor sites you’ve been to and track you using cookies and provide you pop-ups, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Page 3 of 6 o Simulating experience: There is an app that is called HIV roulette in which the user chooses people that they might interact with. You then spin the roulette wheel and the system informs you of the possibility of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. o Competition and recognition: Fitbits also use competition and recognition pursausion techniques to compete against friends and your personal best and recognises good behaviour. o Visualizing the personalities When systems put users into certain demographic groups and feed them advertising 3.3 Discuss how the design of technology can change the attitude and behaviour of people (18) Technology can be designed to change the attitude and behaviour of people. In one study in order to encourage people to take the stairs, the stairs were designed as a large piano. When People walked. After this adjust to the stairs, the amount of people taking the stairs increased. Technology can be designed to encourage positive behaviours in people or they can be used to entice, cajole or lure people into buying products. Designers use methods such as Just in time persuasion. For example, you were about to buy something on a website and then changed your mind. As you are about to exit the site, a pop up appears and offers you a discount. Simulating an experience for example the piano stairs is fun and interesting and would encourage people to take the stairs. Personalising. I think google does this very well albeit a bit creepy. They are trying to gain market share for products such as google sheets and google docs, as well as the use of their on line calendar. I personally have had reminders to pay accounts. Google read my mails, realised I had to pay an account and send a reminder on the day of payment. On my birthday, the google doodle changed to happy birthday and when I went closer, my first name appeared. Recommendation. Amazon had designed it web sites so that it keeps data on what other users have bought when they purchased the same item you did. That way they are able to recommed to you additional items that might correlate with what you are buying. Monitoring and tracking. Again with Amazon, they keep a record of genres and items you are more likely to buy and then they market products in that genre to you via your e mail address. Competition and recognition . With all the focus on the environment, there are apps that next to your taps that monitor your water consumption and have graphs so that each family member can track our much water they are using. This builds competition and encourages the desired behaviour. Feelings of guilt and achievement get used in order to achieve desired results. Fit bits and exercise gadgets also encourage exercise and healthy living. Many people buy them to check them out or as status symbol. There are others who use the full functionality of these devices. I know people who all own them and they have competitions to see who will have the most steps by the end of the week. Visualizing the personalities in virtual communities. Personalities in virtual communities also entice you to buy, like the little chat bots that pop up when you get to a sit. These can either encourage you to buy or annoy you. It depends are how well they are designed.

The exact design differs between mo dels by they support book reading that is intended to be as comfortable as reading a paper book. The developers of a new e-reader want to find out how appealing it will be to young people under the age of 18 years of age. To this end, they have asked you to conduct some interviews for them. You are required to answer the following questions in preparation for the interview. 4.1 What is the goals of your data gathering session? Will the e-reader be appealing to young people under the age of 18. 4.2 List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the interview. Notes and Photographs Video Audio plus Photographs 4.3 What are the disadvantages of takes notes during the interviews The interviewer is so busy focusing on writing which makes it difficult to observe and therefore she might miss other visual communication Easy to lose concentration Biases creep in Speed of writing is limited Difficult and tiring to write Handwriting difficult to decipher 4.4 Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals. What would make an e-reader fun for you? What would annoy you about an e-reader? What would make you apprehensive to pick up an e-reader? How do you think we could make an e-reader cool to use? What would entice you to pick up an e-reader? What colours should the e-readers come in? What do you think would make the ereader pleasurable to use? 5 Question 5 When following a user-centred approach in interaction design there is a principle of focus on users and tasks early. This is one of the principles that make it easy and useful to use a computer system. 5.1 Name and explain five sub-principles that’s explain the meaning of the above statement 5.1.1 User goals and user tasks are the driving force behind development Technology will inform design decisions and options. It should not be the driving force. Always ask how will this technology better support user goals and not where we can employ a certain technology. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Page 5 of 6 5.1.2 Users’ behaviour and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them Understanding behaviour highlights priorities, preferences and explicit intentions. They help designers understand users needs better. 5.1.3 Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for When we design products, we need to understand what the limitations of our users are. Humans makes mistakes. We need to be aware of the cognitive abilities, attention, memory and perceptions as well as physical aspects of our users in order to successfully design for them 5.1.4 Users’ are consulted from the earliest to the latest phases and their input is seriously taken into account There are different levels of user involvement and there are different ways to consult users. Involvement needs to be organised and designers need to respect the views of the user. 5.1.5 All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their environment, their work. This doesn’t mean that designers don’t design. It simply means that all design decisions are taken with the users best interests in mind. using personas is a way to achieve this. 5.2 How would you apply the five sub principles in improving the myUnisa system We would need to find out about the Unisa students goals and tasks, as well as their behaviours, context of use and characteristics. The goals and tasks for Unisa students range from making payments, uploading assignments, reregistering for a new semester. Downloading course material and finding out information about the site. Conduct interviews with students to establish if they have any additional goals or tasks that have not been catered for. Find out what frustrates them, what they enjoy about using the site Our users are students who vary greatly. They all have different cognitive and physical abilities. We need to take that into account when designing the site. We consult with other distance learning institutions and other universities to find other users and other contexts of use which have not been thought of. Our users need to be involved from the first phase right to the last phase. We will need to establish the level of involvement. The availability of our users and what involvement procedure we will define. Questionnaires, workshops, Focus groups and interviews can be applied to our users to help with each phase as well as evaluation to see if we are on the right track. We will create a white board with user requirements, context of work, their environments and use that as a reminder before we make any design decisions.

Discuss heuristic evaluation under the following headings 6.1 Briefly discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation 6.1.1 The briefing Session This is where the experts are told what to do, usually with a script as a guide so that each expert can receive the same briefing 6.1.2 The evaluation Period This is where the user typically spends between 1-2 hours independently inspecting a product, using the heuristics for guidance. Experts need to take at least two passes. The first pass gives a feel for the interface, the second pass allows the evaluator to focus on specific interface elements. The evaluator takes very specific notes to ensure that nothing is missed and that someone else reading the notes can understand. 6.1.3 The debriefing Session This is where the evaluators comes together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solutions. 6.2 Schneiderman’s eight golden rules are used as heuristics for identifying usability problems. Discuss the following three rules. 6.2.1 Cater for universal usability Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity. Novice to expert users. Users of different ages, races, genders, disabilities, technological ability. e.g. Features for novices and shortcuts for experts. 6.2.2 Offer informative feedback For every user action, there should be feedback. For frequent minor actions, the feedback can be modest. For infrequent, major actions, the feedback needs to be more substantial. 6.2.3 Permit easy reversal of actions As much as possible actions need to be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, builds confidence which encourages the user to explore more. Units of reversal include: a single action, a data-entry action or reversal of a complete group of actions.

Explain each principle clearly and describe by the use of an example on how it could be used towards good design of a cell phone (15 marks) Visibility: The more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know what to do next. Feedback: Related to the concept of visibility. It involves sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. Constraints: Refers to determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. Consistency: Refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. Affordance: Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. E.g. door handle affords pulling, mouse button affords pushing. b. For each of the five design principles, identify one difference between cell pone and conventional desktop interfaces that are important to usability designers or evaluators. Explain clearly why and how the difference matter. (10 marks) Question 2 Everyone at some time or other gets frustrated when using a computer. The effect ranges from feeling mildly amused to extremely angry. Discuss any 5 reasons that can explain user frustration with using computers (10 marks) 1. If a system is not effective to use, in that it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do or what the user wants it to do. 2. If a system is not efficient to use, for example, if it’s slow to respond and doesn’t work properly, or if there are too many steps for simple tasks. Or if mistakes are made, and the user has to start all over, i.e. recoverability is bad. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace 3. If a system is not easy to learn – if the design principles of good visibility (easy to find the functions needed), consistency (it works in the same way in similar situations) and affordance (understanding what to do by getting clues from the interface) are neglected, making it not obvious what to do in various situations. 4. If the system is not easy to remember how to use, it means effort to re- learn things every time the user uses it, which is frustrating, for example, having featuritis – an excessive number of possible operations and poor consistency. 5. If the system doesn’t provide feedback about current status, or about the results or consequences of user actions, it can become confusing and frustrating. 6. If the interface is generally overloaded with flashing animations, text and graphics, the over-use of sound effects and music and so on, it is not a pleasant user experience. Question 3 Heuristic evaluation is an informal usability inspection technique developed by Nielson and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user- interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure, on-line help etc conform to the principles. Discuss heuristic evaluation under the following headings: a. The heuristics for evaluation (4 marks) 1. Visibility of system status – The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 2. Match between system and the real world – The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 3. User control and freedom – Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog. Support undo and redo. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace 4. Consistency and standards – Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. 5. Error prevention – Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. 6. Recognition rather than recall – Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialog to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use – Accelerators – unseen by the novice user – may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design – Dialogs should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialog competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors – Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. 10. Help and documentation – Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. b. The three stages of doing heuristic evaluation (4 marks) 1. The briefing sessions where the experts are told what to do. A prepared script is useful as a guide and to ensure each person receives the same briefing. 2. The evaluation period, where each expert typically spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. They will take at least two passes through the interface, to get a feel for the Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace product’s flow and scope, and then to focus on specific interface elements and identify potential usability problems. 3. The debriefing session, in which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solutions. c. Possible problems encountered when doing heuristic evaluation (4 marks) Question 6 Interviews can be viewed as a conversation with a purpose between two or more people where questions are asked by the interviewer to get facts or clarity from the interviewee. Name and discuss the four main types of interviews (12 marks) Unstructured (open-ended) interviews  Exploratory and more like conversations  No particular expectation about the format or content of answers  Benefits: o Generates rich data that gives a deep understanding of topic. o Unconsidered issues may be revealed. Structured interviews  Predetermined questions, same questions for each participant.  Typically closed questions.  Useful when the goals are clearly understood. Semi-structured interviews  Uses both closed and open-ended questions. Basic script for guidance so that same topics are covered for all participants, but question could take different paths based on participants responses and interviewer’s probing.

Vision: Future scenario that frames research and development in interaction design – often depicted in the form of a film/narrative. Theory: Well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon. Model: simplification of some aspect of HCI intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. Framework: Set of interrelated concepts and or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area, online communities or analytical method. 2.3 Identify and briefly discuss four typical problems or challenges that may occur during a heuristic evaluation. Use examples to illustrate the problem (16 marks) Sometimes heuristic evaluation misses severe problems. Heuristic evaluation should not be thought of as a replacement for user testing.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Chapter 1 – What is Interaction Design? Objectives The main aims of this chapter are to:  Explain the difference between good and poor interaction design.  Describe what interaction design is and how it relates to human–computer interaction and other fields.  Explain the relationship between the user experience and usability.  Describe what and who is involved in the process of interaction design.  Outline the different forms of guidance used in interaction design.  Enable you to evaluate an interactive product and explain what is good and bad about it in terms of the goals and core principles of interaction design. Chapter Summary Key Points:  Interaction design is concerned with designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.  Interaction design is multidisciplinary, involving many inputs from wide-ranging disciplines and fields.  The notion of the user experience is central to interaction design.  Optimizing the interaction between users and interactive products requires taking into account a number of interdependent factors, including context of use, types of activity, accessibility, cultural differences, and user groups.  Identifying and specifying relevant usability and user experience goals can help lead to the design of good interactive products.  Design principles, such as feedback and simplicity, are useful heuristics for analyzing and evaluating aspects of an interactive product. What is interaction design? Interaction design means designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives. Put another way, it is about creating user experiences that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate, and interact. The process involves four basic activities: establishing requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping and evaluating. These activities are intended to inform one another and to be repeated. What is usability? Usability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective. It involves optimizing the interactions people have with interactive products to enable them to carry out their activities at work, at school, and in their everyday lives. Name and discuss the usability goals. 1. Effectiveness – a very general goal referring to how good a product is at doing what it’s supposed to do. Question: Is the product capable of allowing people to learn, carry out their work efficiently, access the information they need, or buy the goods they want? Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace 2. Efficiency – refers to the way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks, e.g. fewer steps to accomplish things. Question: Once users have learned how to use a product to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity? 3. Safety – To make interactive products safer in this sense involves 1) preventing the user from making serious errors by reducing the risk of wrong keys/buttons being mistakenly activated (e.g. not placing the quit or delete-file command right next to the save command on a menu) and 2) providing users with various means of recovery should the make errors. Undo functionality. Question: What is the range of errors that are possible using the product and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily from them? 4. Utility – refers to the extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to. Question: Does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will enable users to carry out all their tasks in the way they want to do them? 5. Learnability – refers to how easy a system is to learn and use. Pop-up tutorials can help with more complex systems but ideally people should be able to become more competent without a lot of effort. Question: Is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying out certain actions? How hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way? 6. Memorability – refers to how easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned. Especially important for products that are used infrequently. Question: What kinds of interface support have been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for the products and operations they use infrequently? What is user experience and what are some user experience goals? User experience is concerned with “all aspects of the user’s experience when interacting with the product, service, environment or facility”. Focussed on emotions and feelings of the user when using the product. User experience goals would be to achieve the desirable aspects and avoid the undesirable aspects of the experience: Desirable aspects: Satisfying Enjoyable Engaging Pleasurable Cognitively stimulating Exciting Entertaining Helpful Motivating Surprising Undesirable aspects: Boring Frustrating Annoying Childish Unpleasant Patronizing Making one feel stupid Explain the role of software design principles.  Used by interaction designers to aid their thinking when designing for user experience by helping to orient their thinking about different aspects of their designs.  Derived from theory-based knowledge, experience and common sense, and suggest to designers what to provide and what to avoid at the interface – the do’s and don’ts of interaction design. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  Not intended to specify how to design an actual interface. List five design principles that are concerned with how to determine what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product. 1. Visibility – The more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know what to do next. 2. Feedback – Sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. 3. Constraints – Determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. 4. Consistency – Designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. 5. Affordance – Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it, to ‘give a clue’. There are two types of affordance, Perceived and Real. McCarthy and Wright (2004) 4 core threads that make up holistic experiences. 1. Sensual Thread: Concerned with our sensory engagement with a situation. Can involve thrill, fear, pain, comfort, etc. 2. Compositional Thread: Concerned with narrative part of an experience, as it unfolds, and the way a person makes sense of it. The compositional thread is the internal thinking we do during experiences. 3. Emotional Thread: The framework points out how emotions are intertwined with the situation in which they arise. Emotions also involve making judgements of value. 4. Spatio-temporal Thread: Refers to the space and time in which our experiences take place and their effect upon those experience. Chapter 2 – Understanding and conceptualising Interaction Objectives The main aims of this chapter are to:  Explain what is meant by the problem space.  Explain how to conceptualize interaction.  Describe what a conceptual model is and how to begin to formulate one.  Discuss the use of interface metaphors as part of a conceptual model.  Outline the core interaction types for informing the development of a conceptual model.  Introduce paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks informing interaction design. Summary This chapter has explained the importance of understanding and conceptualizing the problem and design space before trying to build anything. It has stressed throughout the need to be explicit about the claims and assumptions behind design decisions that are suggested. It described an approach to formulating a conceptual model and described the evolution of interface metaphors that have been designed as part of the conceptual model. Finally, it considered other ways of conceptualizing interaction, in terms of interaction types, paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks.

What is a conceptual model? A conceptual model provides a working strategy and a framework of general concepts and their interrelations which describes at a high level how a system is organised and operates. It is used by the design team as the basis from which to develop more detailed and concrete aspects of the design. What are the benefits of conceptualizing the design space early on? Orientation – enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the targeted users. Open-mindedness – preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focussed early on. Common ground – allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on. Discuss the core components of a conceptual model. The relationships between these core components and how they are organised determines the user experience. 1. Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity (e.g. browsing and bookmarking). 2. The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them (e.g. saving, organising). 3. The relationships between those concepts (e.g. whether one object contains another and the relative importance of actions to others). 4. The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (e.g. one can revisit through looking at a list of visited sites, most frequently visited, or saved websites). Discuss the purpose and core components of conceptual models and apply these to a typical online shopping system.

Relationships: similar products shown; other products shown that are often bought together; customer’s details, balance and shopping history (1) 4. Mappings: how often does the customer browse for items and how often does the customer return to the site? How does online shopping change the way we shop and think about shopping? (1) What is an interface metaphor? An interface metaphor is a conceptual model that is instantiated as part of the user interface and is similar in some way to aspects of a physical entity but also has its own behaviours and properties. For example, the desktop metaphor in modern operating systems like Windows and MacOS. In which three ways can metaphors and analogies be applied in conceptual design?  A way of conceptualising what we are doing, e.g. surfing the web, which conjures up imagery of an ocean of information that we are traversing.  As a conceptual model instantiated at the interface, e.g. a material metaphor like the ‘paper’ card, which has strong associations with cards in real life that contain limited related information, can be sorted and flicked through easily.  As a way of visualising an operation, e.g. an icon of a shopping cart into which we place items we wish to purchase on an online shopping website. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of metaphors. Advantages  Interface metaphors are based on conceptual models that combine familiar knowledge with new concepts, hence, helps users to easily understand the underlying model.  Exploit user’s familiar knowledge, helping them to understand the unfamiliar, hence, makes learning new systems easier. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  It is easier to learn and talk about what you are doing on a computer interface in terms of what you familiar to in your daily life.  Enables a greater diversity of users to understand computer functionality.  Improve users’ confidence. Disadvantages  Designers sometimes have a misconception; they try to design an interface metaphor to look and behave like the physical entity it is compared with.  Breaks conventional and cultural rules.  Constrains designers in the way they conceptualize the problem space.  Conflict with design principles.  Not being able to understand the system functionality beyond the metaphor.  Designers can base their designs on existing objects that were badly designed.  The imagination of designers to come up with new conceptual models is limited. Identify and describe the four types of interaction.  Instructing – This is where a user instructs a system and tells it what to do, for example, giving instructions to a system to print a document. o The benefit of this type of interaction is that it supports quick and efficient interaction. o Various systems were designed based on this model, for example computers, radios, TVs, etc.  Conversing – This is where users would have a dialog with a system. The system acts as a dialog partner and impersonates a human being. o Currently supported through voice recognition, interactive voice response systems through phones. o The advantage of conversation model is that it allows people to interact with a system in a way that is familiar to them – talking. o The disadvantage of the model is that voice interaction can be one sided, for example, automated phone-based system that use auditory menus to advance he interaction.  Manipulating – This is where users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them. The manipulation is informed by how users manipulate physical objects in real world. o Direct manipulation (DM) framework influenced the design of GUI based computers. o Advantages of DM interfaces are good learnability and memorability.  Exploring – This is where users move through a virtual or a physical environment. Sensors are used in physical environments to enable people to interact with an environment, for example, fire sensors, motion sensors etc. o Virtual worlds, especially through 3D have been implemented to provide spaces for learning, play games and fantasy. o The advantage of exploration model is that it provides authentic exploration of objects that may not be readily available. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace What is a framework? A framework is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area (e.g. collaborative learning) or analytic method (e.g. ethnographic studies). A classic early example of a conceptual framework in HCI is Norman’s (1998) explication of the relationship between the design of a conceptual model and the user’s understanding of it. The framework comprises three interacting components. Discuss each of these components.  The designer’s model is the model the designer has of how the system should work. This is how the designer envisions the system working and how he/she intends that users should interact with the system.  The system image is how the system actually works, and is portrayed to the user through the interface, manuals, help facilities and so on. The system image should make obvious what a user should do.  The users’ model represents how the user understands how the system works, which ideally should match with what is presented in the system image and what the designer intended. Why is it important that designers consolidate the three components when designing software? In an ideal world, users should be able to carry out activities in the way intended by the designer by interacting with the system image that makes it obvious what to do. If the three components mentioned above are not consolidated properly, it can lead to a poor user experience. If the system image does not make the designer’s model clear to the users, it is likely that they will end up with an incorrect understanding of the system, which in turn will increase their chances of using the system ineffectively and making errors. By drawing attention to this potential discrepancy, designers can be made aware of the importance of trying to bridge the gap more effectively. Definitions Paradigm: Refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values and practices. Vision: Future scenario that frames research and development in interaction design – often depicted in the form of a film/narrative. Theory: Well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon. Model: simplification of some aspect of HCI intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. Framework: Set of interrelated concepts and or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area, online communities or analytical method. Chapter 4 – Social Interaction Objectives The main aims of this chapter are to:  Explain what is meant by social interaction.  Describe the social mechanisms that are used by people when communicating and collaborating.  Discuss how social media have changed the ways in which we keep in touch, make contact, and manage our social and working lives.  Explain what is meant by telepresence. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  Give an overview of shareable technologies and some of the studies showing how they can facilitate collaboration and group participation. Summary Human beings are inherently social; people will always need to collaborate, coordinate, and communicate with one another, and the diverse range of applications, web-based services, and technologies that have emerged are enabling them to do so in more extensive and diverse ways. In this chapter we have looked at some core aspects of sociality, namely communication and collaboration. We examined the main social mechanisms that people use in different conversational settings when interacting face-to-face and at a distance. A number of collaborative and telepresence technologies designed to support and extend these mechanisms were discussed, highlighting core interaction design concerns. Key points  Social interaction is central to our everyday life.  Social mechanisms have evolved in face-to-face and remote contexts to facilitate conversation, coordination, and awareness.  Talk and the way it is managed are integral to coordinating social interaction.  Many kinds of computer-mediated communication systems have been developed to enable people to communicate with one another when in physically different locations.  Keeping aware of what others are doing and letting others know what you are doing are important aspects of collaboration and socializing.  Social media have brought about significant changes in the way people keep in touch and manage their social lives. Social interaction is central to humans’ everyday life. Describe how social media have changed the way in which people interact. (10)  People are used to face-to-face communication which allows not only talking and listening but also taking into account visual clues such as facial expressions.  The telephone overcame distance and time barriers but limited communication to audible signs.  Messaging apps allows video calls, video conferencing and texting.  These technologies lack the richness of face-to-face communication and people compensate for these constraints by talking louder, using emoticons or projecting themselves more.  Social media apps allow one-to-many broadcasting, is immediate and can be on-sided.  People switch easily between different technologies depending on the context (texting; emailing; chatting)  Messages can easily be sent to the wrong receiver. Reliability of messages can be a problem. Face to face conversation In addition when a breakdown occurs in a conversation via email, people can literally spell out what they meant, making things more clear/explicit in a subsequent email, using capitals, emoticons, exclamations, bold, highlighting, and so on. If the message is beyond repair, they may resort to another mode of communication that allows greater flexibility of expression, either telephoning or speaking to the recipient face-to-face. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Remote conversation Telepresence  Telepresence technologies project people’s body movements, actions, voice and facial expressions to give the appearance that they are present in the meeting. Images of a person can be superimposed on a workspace. Remote people can appear life-like. Wearable devices could send hugs (created by transmitted buzzes, skin warmth and heart rate) to remove friends. Co-presence Shareable interfaces enable more than one person to use them at the same time to enhance co-located collaboration and gaming.  Physical coordination: voice and gestures used in face-to-face communication.  Awareness: a combination of direct observation and peripheral monitoring/situational awareness facilitates interdependent teamwork.  Shareable interfaces exploit and simulate existing forms of coordination and awareness mechanisms to encourage more equitable participation in groups. Social translucence visualise social interaction and could be used to encourage people to socialise more. Physical Coordination Awareness Shareable Interfaces Chapter 5 – Emotional Interaction An overarching goal of interaction design is to develop products that elicit positive responses from users, such as feeling at ease, being comfortable, and enjoying the experience of using them. Emotions and the user experience Emotional interaction is concerned with how we feel and react when interacting with technology. It covers different aspects of the user experience from how we feel when first finding out about a new product to getting rid of it. It also looks at why people become emotionally attached to certain products, how social robots might help reduce loneliness and how to change human behaviour through the use of emotive feedback. Consider the different emotions experienced for a common everyday activity – shopping online for a product, such as a new smartphone, a washing machine or a vacation. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Firstly, there is the realisation of needing or wanting it, then the desire and anticipation of purchasing it. This is followed by the joy or frustration of finding out more about what products are available and deciding which to choose. This entails matching what is available with what you like or need and whether you can afford it. The thrill of deciding on a purchase may be quickly followed by the shock of how much it costs and the disappointment that you can’t afford it. The process of having to decide again may be accompanied by annoyance as you can’t find one that is as good as your first choice. When you do eventually make a decision, you experience a sense of relief. Emotional interaction is about considering what makes us happy, sad, annoyed, anxious, frustrated, motivated delirious, and so on, and using this knowledge to inform the design of different aspects of the user experience, from when we first want something to when we no longer interact with it or need to replace it. Ortony’s model of emotion and behaviour Highest level Middle level Lowest level Reflective Behavioural Visceral  Brain processes that contemplate.  Entails conscious thoughts where people generalise across events/ step back from routine and the immediate  The brain processes that control our everyday behaviour.  Where most human activities occur, e.g. well-learned routine operations such as talking, typing and driving.  Are the parts of the brain that are pre-wired to auto respond to events.  Respond rapidly, making judgements about what is good/bad, safe/dangerous, pleasure/abhorrent. It also triggers emotional responses to stimuli that are expressed through a combination of physiological and behavioural responses. Explain what are expressive, annoying and persuasive interfaces, in the context of emotional interaction. Expressive interfaces  Use expressive forms like emoticons, sounds, icons and virtual agents to convey emotional states or elicit an emotional response in users.  For example, a user may feel at ease and reassured that the computer is functioning correctly when seeing a smiling icon on screen while it is booting up (as was the case with the earlier Apple Mac computers).  Dynamic icons and animations can convey further information about the status of a system. Use of imagery such as this can result in a more engaging and enjoyable experience. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Annoying interfaces  When something that should be easy to use turns out to be complex, for example, trying to switch from watching a DVD to the TV.  Effort to negate this issue such as friendly agents, can also become annoying (e.g. Microsoft’s Clippy became distracting and irritating for users).  Interfaces, if poorly designed, can make people feel stupid, insulted or threatened to the point of being annoyed or even losing their temper. Persuasive interfaces  Draw people’s attention to certain kinds of information in an attempt to change what they do or think, such as the recommendation system on Amazon, which tries to tempt you into buying something – made even easier by their one-click purchase option. A user may be persuaded to buy more than he/she originally intended to.  These techniques can also be applied to non-commercial domains, such as changing behaviour related to health, safety, fitness, personal relationships, energy consumption, and learning. Discuss any five reasons that can explain user frustration with using computers. Frustration can occur if usability goals, user experience goals and good design principles haven’t been given enough attention. Frustration can be caused by the following reasons:  If a system is not effective to use, in that it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do or what the user wants it to do.  If a system is not efficient to use, for example, if it’s slow to respond and doesn’t work properly, or if there are too many steps for simple tasks. Or if mistakes are made, and the user has to start all over, i.e. recoverability is bad.  If a system is not easy to learn – if the design principles of good visibility (easy to find the functions needed), consistency (it works in the same way in similar situations) and affordance (understanding what to do by getting clues from the interface) are neglected, making it not obvious what to do in various situations.  If the system is not easy to remember how to use, it means effort to re-learn things every time the user uses it, which is frustrating, for example, having featuritis – an excessive number of possible operations and poor consistency.  If the system doesn’t provide feedback about current status, or about the results or consequences of user actions, it can become confusing and frustrating.  If the interface is generally overloaded with flashing animations, text and graphics, the over-use of sound effects and music and so on, it is not a pleasant user experience. Explain what is meant by persuasive technology. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Technology that is designed in such a way as to influence and change the attitude or behaviour of the user by drawing their attention to certain kinds of information. E.g. a recommender system which suggests specific books, hotels, restaurants, etc. to the user based on his/her previous purchases, choices and taste. Discuss how the design of a technology can change the attitude and behaviour of people.  Interactive computing systems deliberately designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviours in a predetermined way. For example, to persuade people to join good cause, give up bad habits, donate money, etc.  The study of computers as a persuasive technology is known as Captology.  The definition put emphasis on the intentionality of persuasion, which is the aim of the software designer.  Successful application of persuasive technologies has been reported in marketing, health, health, safety and environment. For example, Amazon.com uses a few of these techniques to entice people to purchase more products. Based on a user’s purchase history, browsing history and choices, and even the history of other people who bought similar products, Amazon is designed to recommend related products that are likely to interest that user. The website uses this more targeted, personalised form of ‘just-in-time’ persuasion, where the right product is shown to the right person at the right time. Additionally, their ‘one-click’ buy button is designed to make it even easier to tempt users into making an impulse purchase by taking all the effort out of the process. A product designed to monitor, and track behaviour can persuade people to change their habits or to do something that will improve their well-being. An example of this was the Pokémon Pikachu virtual pet designed for children which had a built-in pedometer. It was designed to motivate children to be physically active in order to keep the pet alive. Another example is water usage monitoring and tracking. This can be taken a step further by introducing elements of competition and recognition. With the WaterBot product, householders could be persuaded to be more conservative by being shown bar graphs near taps indicating how much water a person has used in relation to others in the household. Users would change their behaviour in order to ‘win’ by using the least water. Attitudes could be changed in this way by promoting discussion about water usage in the household.  Strategies that are employed in designing technologies in order to change people’s attitude and behaviour include: 1. Just in time persuasion 2. Simulating experience 3. Personalising 4. Recommendation 5. Monitoring and tracking 6. Competition and recognition 7. Visualising the personalities in virtual communities.  Persuasive technologies have disadvantages, especially deception.  Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Some techniques are more subtle and persuasive on an almost sub-conscious level. For example, in designing products to promote the reduction of individuals’ carbon footprints, a conscious choice was made to simply show daily consumption figures on a device and allow the individuals to come to the right conclusion themselves. Being too forward and in your face in this case may lead people to reject the persuasion. By making the products ‘neutral’, the attitude of the user changed for the better. Another example is the use of personalisation to make a user feel welcomed and special, such as on Amazon where they are then also greeted with recommendations and the categories they’re historically most interested in, which all leads to more purchases. The recent rise of virtual reality (VR) is interesting in terms of persuasive technology. Simulation can persuade people to change their attitudes or behaviours by enabling them to immediately observe the link between cause and effect. For example, playing a game which places users in situations where their lives are in danger, such as an emergency situation on an aeroplane, can persuade them to change their behaviour in real life to avoid those same situations. Explain the term anthropomorphism and its disadvantages. Anthropomorphism is attributing human qualities to objects and has been used in interaction design to design applications that have human-like qualities A number of virtual characters and robot pets have been developed to motivate people to learn, buy, and listen. Disadvantages  Make people feel inferior or anxious.  Studies have shown that personalized feedback is considered to be less honest and makes users feel less responsible for their actions.  Lack the ability to follow a conversation and fail to suggest appropriate help.  Speech recognition systems incorrectly may translate people say.  If the technology is targeted for novice users, experts may become frustrated.  Giving users no control over the system frustrates users.  The systems deceive users because they think that computers have all human capabilities, hence they blame them when something goes wrong.  Agents cannot give some common examples that are not related to the current problem. With reference to emotional interaction, compare pleasurable interfaces (and other positive design elements) with annoying interfaces (and other negative design elements). (10) Expressive forms like emoticons, sounds, icons, and virtual agents have been used at the interface to (i) convey emotional states and/or (ii) elicit certain kinds of emotional responses in users, such as feeling at ease, comfort and happiness. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace The design of aesthetically pleasing interfaces has become of central concern to interaction design. Empirical studies have shown that the aesthetics of an interface can have a positive effect on people’s perception of the system’s usability. When the look and feel of an interface is pleasing and pleasurable – e.g. beautiful graphics, nice feel to the way the elements have been put together, well-designed fonts, elegant use of images and colour, a good sense of balance – users are likely to be more tolerant, e.g. they may be prepared to wait a few more seconds for a website to download. Furthermore, good-looking interfaces are often more satisfying and pleasurable to use. A key concern is to strike a balance between designing for aesthetic versus usable interfaces and pleasurable versus useful one. In regard to annoying interfaces, if an interface is designed poorly, it can make people look stupid, or feel insulted or threatened. The effect can be to make them annoyed to the point of losing their temper. There are numerous situations that cause such emotional responses, they include: When an application does not work properly, or crashes; When a system does not do what the user wants it to do; When a user’s expectation is not met; When error messages pop up that are vague or obtuse; When the appearance of an interface is too noisy, garish, gimmicky, or patronizing; Websites that are overloaded with text and graphics, making it difficult to find the information desired and making them slow to access; Flashing animations, especially flashing banner ads and pop-up ads that cover what the user is looking at which require them to actively click on a check box to close them; The over-use of sound effects and music, especially when selecting options, carrying out actions, running tutorials, or watching website demos. Chapter 7 – Data Gathering What are the five key issues that determine the success of a data gathering exercise? 1. Setting goals – The type of information required after gathering the data needs to be clear. What is it that you want to know? Specific goals should be set about what data is required since it will affect the gathering techniques used and the analysis to be performed on the data. 2. Identifying participants – The goals that are set will help you identify the kind of people you will need to gather data from. From this group, depending how large it is, a smaller group will either be randomly selected (a deciding factor is whether you need to apply statistical tests for a population) or chosen based on convenience and availability of volunteers. 3. Relationship with participants – The relationship between the people doing the gathering and the people providing the data needs to be clear and professional. Typically, participants will sign an informed consent form explaining the purpose of the data gathering, how the data will be used, and assurance that they may withdraw at any time. 4. Triangulation – This technique is useful for validating the results of some inquiry by using more than one data gathering or data analysis technique to arrive at similar results from different perspectives, thereby confirming, in a way, the results. In practice, this is very difficult to achieve, however. 5. Pilot studies – Perform a small trial run of the main study. In doing so, you can make sure that the proposed method is viable before starting the real study. Potential problems can be identified and corrected in advance, making it more likely that the real study will be successful. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace What is the goal of your data gathering session (e-reader example)? The goal is to collect sufficient, relevant, and appropriate data depending on what we want to know. In this case, we want to know if young people under 18 are interested in a new type of e-reader we want to develop. List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the interview.  The interviewer can take notes and photographs of the interview. Taking notes is the least technical and most flexible way of recording data, and photographs of artefacts can be used to supplement notes.  The interviewee can be recorded with an audio recording device and photographs can supplement the audio content if required. Audio recording is a good alternative to note taking and less intrusive than video.  The interviewee can be recorded on video with a camera. May require more than one camera in different locations to capture all that is required. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Discuss any three disadvantages of taking notes during the interview.  It can be difficult and tiring to write and listen or observe at the same time. It’s easier for the interviewer to lose concentration while their focus is on writing or typing rather than on the interviewee’s thoughts and comments.  Handwriting can be difficult to decipher after the fact.  Speed of writing or typing is limited, and important information may be missed. Discuss what should be avoided when designing interview questions.  The questions should not be ambiguous.  Avoid emotional language.  Jargon or complex language should be avoided.  Avoid leading questions.  Avoid bias.  Ask question one at a time.  Avoid questions that require a response of a simple yes or no answer.  Interview questions should follow some order. Do not ask abrupt questions.  Avoid questions that are not related to interview goals.  The type of data recording should not interfere with the interview proceeding. Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals.  How would you say the experience of using an e-reader is better than the traditional alternatives?  What do you find engaging and enjoyable about using an e-reader?  What do you find frustrating about using an e-reader? Name and describe the types of interview methods. Unstructured (open-ended) interviews  Exploratory and more like conversations  No particular expectation about the format or content of answers  Benefits: o Generates rich data that gives a deep understanding of topic. o Unconsidered issues may be revealed. Structured interviews  Predetermined questions, same questions for each participant.  Typically closed questions.  Useful when the goals are clearly understood. Semi-structured interviews Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  Uses both closed and open-ended questions.  Basic script for guidance so that same topics are covered for all participants, but question could take different paths based on participants responses and interviewer’s probing. Chapter 9 – The process of Interaction Design The importance of involving users  The best way to ensure that development continues to take users’ activities into account, is to involve real users throughout development.  Developers can gain a better understanding of users’ goals, leading to a more appropriate, more usable product.  The purpose of expectation management is to ensure that there are no surprises for users when the product arrives.  Involving users throughout development helps with expectation management because they can see from an early stage what the product’s capabilities are.  Adequate and timely training is another technique for managing expectations.  A reason for user involvement is ownership. Users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product’s development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership towards it and support its use. In a user-centred approach, what are the three principles laid down by Gould and Lewis that they believed would lead to a ‘useful and easy to use computer system’? 1. Early focus on users and tasks – this means first understanding who the users will be by directly studying their cognitive, behavioural, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics. This requires observing users doing their normal tasks, studying the nature of those tasks and then involving users in the design process. 2. Empirical measurement - Early in development, the reactions and performance of intended users to printed scenarios, manuals, etc., are observed and measured. Later on, users interact with simulations and prototypes and their performance and reactions are observed, recorded, and analysed. 3. Iterative design – When problems are found in user testing, they are fixed and then more tests and observations are carried out to see the effects of the fixes. This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of design-test-measure-redesign being repeated as often as necessary. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace When following a user-centred approach in interactive design, there is a principle of ‘focus on users and tasks early’. Name and explain five sub-principles that explain the meaning of the above statement. 1. Users’ tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development – In a user-centred approach, technology will inform the design options, but the users’ goals will inform the choice that supports them best. 2. Users’ behaviour and context of use are studied, and the system is designed to support them – How people perform their tasks – understanding their priorities, preferences and intentions – is significant. 3. Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for – Products designed for humans should take into account our cognitive (such as attention, memory, perception issues) and physical (height, strength, mobility) limitations. 4. Users are consulted throughout the development process from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account. It’s important that users are respected by designers. 5. All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment – This doesn’t mean that users make the decisions. As long as designers remain aware of users while making decisions, this principle will be upheld. What is the importance of involving users during the design of a computer information system?  Improved quality of the system arising from a more accurate capture of user requirements, this is because they use the system every day or on daily basis.  To avoid incorporation of costly system features that users would not want to use or cannot use.  To provide users with a system that meets their real expectations.  To ensure that users do not encounter surprises when the new system is delivered.  Greater understanding of the system by the users results in more effective use. Users can see from early stages of software development what the capabilities of the system are.  If users are involved, they will have chance to work with the product before it is released, and they will have a better understanding of what to expect on the new system.  Increased participation in decision making within software development cycle increases ownership of the system by the users. Users who were involved feel that they have contributed to a product’s development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Four Basic Activities of Interaction Design p330  Establishing Requirements – Know who target users are and what kind of support an interactive product could usefully provide. These needs form the basis of the product’s requirements and underpin subsequent design and development. Est requirements is fundamental to a user-centered approach and very important in interaction design. Understanding the needs is established through data gathering and analysis.  Designing Alternatives – This is the core activity of designing and actually involves suggesting ideas for meeting the requirements. It can be viewed as 2 sub-activities: conceptual and concrete design. Conceptual design involves producing the conceptual model for the product and a conceptual model describes an abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Concrete design considers the detail of the product including the colours, sounds, and images to use, menu design, and icon design. Alternatives are considered at every point.  Prototyping – Interaction design involves designing interactive products. Most sensible way for users to evaluate such designs is to interact with it, and this can be achieved through prototyping. Different prototyping techniques exist, but not all require a working piece of software.  Evaluating – This is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design that is measured in terms of a variety of usability and user experience criteria. Interaction design requires a high level of user involvement throughout development, and this enhances the chances of an acceptable product being delivered. Evaluation does not replace the activities concerned with quality assurance and testing to make sure that the final product is fit for purpose, but it complements and enhances then. Briefly discuss how you would involve users during the design of a computer information system. As a member of the design team:  Full time: constant input, but lose touch with other users.  Part time: patchy input, can be very stressful.  Short term: inconsistent across project life.  Long term: consistent, but lose touch with users. Via newsletters and other dissemination devices:  Can reach wider selection of users.  Need communication both ways.  User involvement after product is released.  Combination of these approaches. Chapter 10 – Establishing Requirements Describe different kinds of requirements Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace There are two different kinds of requirements. Functional and Non-functional. Functional requirements capture what products can do. Non-functional requirements say what constraints there are on the system and its development Data Requirements: Capture type, volatility, size/amount, accuracy and value of required data. Environmental Requirements: Refer to circumstances in what the interactive product will operate. There are four aspects of environmental requirements that must be considered when establishing requirements. 1. Physical Environment: such as how much lighting, noise, movement, and dust is expected in operational environment. 2. Social Environment: e.g. collaboration and coordination to be expected. 3. Organisational Environment, e.g. how good is the user support likely to be, and how easily can it be obtained. 4. Technical Environment to be established User Characteristics: capture the key attributes of intended user group and the abilities and skills. Other characteristics that may affect the design are: user’s nationality, educational background, preferences, person circumstances, physical/mental disabilities, and so on. Usability goals and user experience goals: These are another kind of requirement, and should be captured together with appropriate measures. Usability should be given due priority and can facilitate progress tracking. Data gathering techniques The overall purpose of data gathering in the requirements activity is to collect sufficient, relevant, and appropriate data so that a set of stable requirements can be produced. Data gathering needs to cover a wide spectrum of issues: The tasks that users currently perform and their associated goals, the context in which the task are performed, and the rationale for the current situation. Interviews: Are good for exploring issues, and semi-structured or unstructured interviews are often used early on to elicit scenarios. Equally important for development team members to meet stakeholders and for users to feel involved. Focus Groups: Are good for gaining a consensus view and highlighting areas of conflict and disagreement during the requirements activity. Questionnaires: May be used for getting initial responses that can then be analysed to choose people to interview or get a wider perspective on particular issues that have arisen elsewhere. Direct Observation: In the requirements activity, observation of participants in their natural setting is used to understand the nature of the tasks and the context in which they are performed. Indirect Observation: Diaries and interaction logging are used less often within the requirements activity where a new product is under development. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Studying Documentation: Manuals and other documentation are a good source of data about the steps involved in an activity and any regulations governing a task. Data gathering Guidelines 1. Focus on identifying the stakeholders’ needs. 2. Involve all the stakeholder groups 3. Involving only one representative from each stakeholder group is not enough, especially if the group is large. 4. Support the data gathering session with suitable props, such as task descriptions and prototypes if available. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Brainstorming for innovation For requirements, two key success factors are firstly that the participants should know the users’ goals that the product is to support, and secondly that no ideas should be criticized or debated. 1. Include participants from a wide range of disciplines, with a broad range of experience; 2. Don’t ban silly stuff. Wild ideas often turn into really useful requirements; 3. Use catalysts for further inspiration. Build one idea on top of another; 4. Keep records. Every idea should be captured without censoring; 5. Sharpen the focus. Start the brainstorm with a well-honed problem; 6. Use warm-up exercises and make the session fun. The group will require warming up if they have not worked together before. Task Analysis Is used mainly to investigate an existing situation, not to envision new products. It is used to analyse the underlying rationale and purpose of what people are doing: what are they trying to achieve, why are they trying to achieve it and how are they going about it? The info gleaned from task analysis establishes a foundation of existing practices on which to build new requirements or design new tasks. Hierarchical Task Analysis [HTA] Involves breaking a task down into subtasks and then into sub-sub-tasks and so on. There are two main problems with using HTA on real problems: 1. Real tasks are very complex, and task analysis does not scale very well. 2. Task analysis is limited in the kinds of task it can model. E.g. it cannot model tasks that are overlapping, or in parallel, nor can it model interruptions. Benefits of task analysis include: 1. It lets you objectively compare alternative designs, based on a user’s planned tasks and subtasks. 2. It provides a good understanding of the interaction at whichever level of abstraction is appropriate. This facilitates good design. 3. It supports design reuse – again at different levels of abstraction. Chapter 11 – Conceptual Design Conceptual design is concerned with transforming requirements into a conceptual model. Designing the conceptual model is fundamental to interaction design, yet the idea of a conceptual model can be difficult to grasp. A conceptual model is an outline of what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Interface metaphors – combine familiar knowledge with new knowledge in a way that will help a user understand the product. Erickson (1990) suggest a three step process for choosing a good interface metaphor. 1. Understand what the system will do, i.e. identifying the functional requirements. 2. Understand which bits of the product are likely to cause users problems, i.e. which tasks or subtasks cause problems, are complicated or are critical. 3. Generate metaphors. Looking for metaphors in the users’ description of the tasks is good starting point. Chapter 13 – Evaluation Studies Describe the three broad categories of evaluation. 1. Controlled settings involving users – e.g. labs and living labs. Users’ activities are controlled in order to test hypotheses and measure or observe certain behaviours. The main methods are usability testing and experiments. 2. Natural settings involving users – e.g. online communities and products for public places. There is little or no control of users’ activities in order to determine how the product would be used in the real world. The main method used is field studies. 3. Any settings not involving users – consultants and researchers’ critique, predict, and model aspects of the interface in order to identify the most obvious usability problems. The range of methods includes inspections, heuristics, walkthroughs, models, and analytics. Compare laboratory usability testing and field studies under the following headings: ** The environment in which the testing is conducted: In laboratory usability testing, the environment and user activity are controlled in order to test hypotheses and measure or observe certain behaviour. There may be a list of tasks and operations for the users to try out in order to get a complete evaluation of the product features. In field studies, there is little or no control of users’ activities in order to determine how the product would be used in natural settings in the real world. It is messy in the sense that activities tend to overlap and there are constant interruptions. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace ** The participants: In both settings, appropriate groups of typical users from the target audience would participate in the evaluation, i.e. the users for whom the system is designed. In lab-based studies, the participants would be brought into the lab separately and asked to perform predefined tasks. Field studies may be short or take place over months, in a natural environment where it is up to the participants to decide how to use the product and when. ** Data collection: In usability testing data is collected from conducting experiments for certain predefined scenarios through observation of participants. They may be recorded on video and audio as they perform tasks. Data captured includes facial expressions and body language. Participants may be asked to speak out loud so that what they are thinking, and planning can be revealed and recorded. Interactions with the software may also be recorded by logging software, such as keystroke loggers and mouse movements recorders. After the session, structured or semi-structured interviews are conducted to elicit participants’ opinions about how they found the experience. Questionnaires are also used, where participants can rate things along a number of scales. In field studies, data is collected about how the product is being used in work or other environments. Data is in the form of events and conversations, recorded by researchers as notes and audio or video recordings, or by participants as diaries and notes. Some examples include recording the frequency of daily activities, such as eating and drinking habits, or social interactions like phone and face-to-face conversations. Software running on smartphones could trigger messages to participants at certain intervals, requesting them to answer or fill out forms and checklists. Data can also be recorded from intermittent interviews with participants. ** Advantages and disadvantages:  Lab-based studies are good at revealing usability problems. You can ensure that all the tasks and operations in the product are evaluated because of the degree of control, while in field studies, the participants may not try out the full range of functions in the product.  Lab-based studies enable evaluators to reduce outside influences and distractions, such as colleagues or friends talking, so that the findings are reliable.  Field studies are expensive and difficult to conduct but are good at demonstrating how people use technologies in their intended setting, while lab-based studies are poor at capturing context of use.  The downside of handing over control in field studies is that it makes it difficult to anticipate what is going to happen and to be present when something interesting does happen. This is in contrast to usability testing where there is always an investigator or camera at hand to record events.  A potential advantage of field studies is that is that unexpected data can be obtained that provides different insights into people’s perception and experience with the product. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  In lab-based studies, specific hypotheses can be reliably tested and measured, however with field studies they cannot be tested with the same degree of certainty. Chapter 13 – Evaluation Studies Usability Testing The goal is to test whether the product being developed is usable by the intended user Types of Evaluation 1. Controlled settings involving users 2. Natural settings involving users 3. Any settings not involving users. Chapter 14 – Evaluation Studies: From Controlled to natural settings Usability Testing The goal is to test whether the product being developed is usable by the intended user population to achieve the tasks for which it was designed. Also, the acceptable number of users that should be involved in a usability study is between 5 – 12. Usability testing takes place in usability labs or temporary makeshift labs. These labs enable evaluators to control the test setting. Usability testing focuses on performance measures such as as how long and how many errors are made, when completing a set of predefined tasks. Indirect observation is conducted and supplemented by user satisfaction questionnaires and interviews. Remote testing systems have been developed that are more affordable than usability labs and also more portable. Field studies are evaluation studies that are carried out in natural settings. They aim to discover how people interact with technology in the real world. Field studies that involve the deployment of prototypes or technologies in natural settings may also be referred to as in the wild. Labs and Equipment Usability labs can be very expensive and labour-intensive to run and maintain. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Modifications would need to be made to these labs on a regular basis when new products or systems are tested, and can be time-consuming. Chapter 15 – Evaluation: Inspections, Analytics and Models What is heuristic evaluation? Heuristic evaluation is an informal usability inspection technique developed by Nielsen and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure or online help conform to the principles. What is Jakob Nielsen’s original set of heuristics for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) evaluation? 1. Visibility of system status – The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 2. Match between system and the real world – The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 3. User control and freedom – Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog. Support undo and redo. 4. Consistency and standards – Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. 5. Error prevention – Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. 6. Recognition rather than recall – Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialog to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use – Accelerators – unseen by the novice user – may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design – Dialogs should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialog competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors – Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. 10. Help and documentation – Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace If these are too general, Nielsen suggests developing category specific heuristics. Consider the following design guidelines and for each suggest a question that could be used in heuristics evaluation. Good graphical design is important. Reading long sentences and paragraphs is difficult on the screen, so break material into discrete, meaningful chunks to give the website a structure. Is the page layout structured meaningfully? Is there too much text on each page? Avoid excessive use of colour. Colour is useful for indicating different kinds of information. How is colour used? Is it used as a form of coding? Is it used to make the site bright and cheerful? Is it excessive and garish? Does it have an impact on the user’s enjoyment? Avoid excessive use of graphics. Are there any flashing banners? Are there complex introduction sequences? Do the graphics add to the site and improve the user’s experience? Download time for smartphone applications must be short. Is all the content really needed? Can versions be provided that are quick to download? Schneiderman’s eight golden rules are used as heuristics for identifying usability problems. List the rules and briefly describe. 1. Strive for consistency – Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations: identical terminology, consistent colour, layout, fonts etc. should be employed throughout. Exceptions should be limited. 2. Cater to universal usability – Recognise the needs of diverse users. Design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Think about the different skill levels of users, from novice to expert, their age ranges, disabilities and technological diversity. Each of these factors enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices such as explanations, and features for experts, such as short-cuts and faster pacing, can enrich the interface design and improve perceived system quality. 3. Offer informative feedback – For every user action, there should be system feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can be modest, for example, having an informational message appear somewhere on screen and then fade away, whereas for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial, like a modal pop-up with a warning message. Visual presentation of the objects of interest provides a convenient environment for showing changes explicitly. 4. Design dialogs to yield closure – Sequences of actions should be organised into groups with a beginning, middle and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, and indicates to prepare for the next group of actions. 5. Prevent errors – As much as possible, design a system such that users cannot make serious errors; e.g. grey out menu items that are not appropriate. The interface should detect errors and offer simple instructions for recovery. 6. Permit easy reversal of actions – As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data-entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name-address block. 7. Support internal locus of control – Experienced users need the sense that they are in charge of the interface. No surprises and no annoyances or difficulties obtaining the desired results. 8. Reduce short-term memory load – Humans limited capacity for information processing in short-term memory required that designers avoid interfaces in which users must remember and use information across different screens. Briefly discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation.  The briefing sessions where the experts are told what to do. A prepared script is useful as a guide and to ensure each person receives the same briefing.  The evaluation period, where each expert typically spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. They will take at least two passes through the interface, to get a feel for the product’s flow and scope, and then to focus on specific interface elements and identify potential usability problems.  The debriefing session, in which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solutions. Heuristic Evaluation for websites  Clarity – make the system as clear, concise, and meaningful as possible for the intended audience.  Minimize unnecessary complexity and cognitive load – Make the system as simple as possible for users to accomplish their tasks.  Provide users with context – Interfaces should provide users with a sense of context in time and space.  Promote a pleasurable and positive user experience – The user should be treated with respect and design should be aesthetically pleasing and promote a pleasurable and rewarding experience. Predictive Models Rather than involving expert evaluators role-playing users as in inspections, or tracking their behaviour as in analytics, predictive models use formulas to derive various measures of user performance. Cognitive Walkthrough Involve simulating a user’s problem-solving process. The steps are: 1. Characteristics of typical users are identified and documented, and sample tasks are developed that focus on the aspects of the design to be evaluated. 2. A designer and one or more expert evaluators come together to do the analysis. 3. Evaluators walk through action sequences for each task, placing it within the context of a typical scenario, and as they do this, they try to answer the following questions: a. Will the user know what to do to achieve the task? b. Will the user notice that the correct action is available? Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace c. Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly? 4. As walkthrough is being done, a record of critical information is compiled in which: a. The assumptions about what would cause problems and why are identified b. Notes about side issues and design changes are made c. A summary of the results is compiled. 5. The design is then revised to fix the problems.
