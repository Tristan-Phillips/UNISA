CONCLUSION .............................................................................................................................. 11 COS3721/101/0/2022 3 1 INTRODUCTION Dear Student Welcome to the Operating Systems and Architecture module (COS3721). In this module, we will study the basic principles and concepts of operating systems. A user communicates with the computer via the operating system, which is therefore an extremely important software component of the computer system. Furthermore, techniques developed for operating systems influence many other areas of computer science, including computer architecture, programming languages, compilers, databases, computer networks and mobile agents. The students registered for this module are expected to have a very good background in general assembly language programming and computer organisation covered in the module COS2621 or an equivalent module. Because this is a fully online module, you will need to use myUnisa to study and complete the learning activities for this module. Visit the website for COS3721 on myUnisa frequently. The website for your module is COS3721-22-Y1. 1.1 Getting started Owing to the nature of this module, you can read about the module and find your study material online. Go to the website at https://my.unisa.ac.za and log in using your student number and password. Click on \"myModules\" at the top of the web page and then on \"Sites\" in the top right corner. In the new window, click on the grey Star icon next to the modules you want displayed on your navigation bar. Close the window in the top right corner. Then select the option \"Reload to see your updated favourite sites\". Now go to your navigation bar and click on the module you want to open. We wish you every success with your studies! 2 OVERVIEW OF COS3721 2.1 Purpose Students who successfully complete this module will be able to develop the knowledge, skills and competencies of the functionality of general operating systems including CPU scheduling, process coordination and concurrency, deadlocks, memory management, protection and security within distributed systems, which will support further studies and applications in Computer Science in the field of Operating Systems. It provides the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies to understand how the user communicates with the computer via the operating system and how the techniques developed for operating systems influence many other areas of Computer Science, including computer architecture, programming languages, compilers, databases, computer networks and mobile agents. The module is delivered via myUnisa, the Internet, peer group interaction, and community engagement in some of the activities. Your Lecturers will interact with students on myUnisa and via email. COS3721/101/0/2022 4 2.2 Outcomes For this module, you will have to master several outcomes that we hope will be able to accomplish by the end of the course: Outcome number Specific outcome 1 Describe the basics principles of computer system organisation and are able to identify different operating system components. 2 Apply operating systems principles to solve process management problems. 3 Apply operating system principles to solve memory management problems. 4 Explain electronic storage management issues. 5 Explain security and protection issues for operating systems 6 Discuss issues relevant for distributed systems 3 CURRICULUM TRANSFORMATION Unisa has implemented a transformation charter based on five pillars and eight dimensions. In response to this charter, we have placed curriculum transformation high on the teaching and learning agenda. Curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both programme and module levels as a phased- in approach. You will notice a marked change in the teaching and learning strategy implemented by Unisa, together with how the content is conceptualised in your modules. We encourage you to embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa in a responsive way within the framework of transformation. 4 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 4.1 Lecturer(s) Pease see Tutorial Letter 301 (SOCALL).

This is also true for first-time students to Unisa. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e-learning institution. Unlike face-to-face/contact institutions, Unisa is somewhat different. It is a mega university and all our programmes are offered through a blended learning mode or fully online learning mode. It is for this reason that we thought it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support so that you can seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. In this regard we offer a specialised student support programme to students entering Unisa for the first time. We refer to this programme as Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme. The FYE is designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE programmes are currently offered: • FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE • FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated. • FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (eg videos on how to submit assignments online). • FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e-mail to fye@unisa.ac.za COS3721/101/0/2022 8 7. HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 7.1 What does it mean to study fully online? Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa. • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office. • All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you via e-mail and SMS, and use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these platforms to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 7.2 myUnisa tools The main tool that we will use is the Lessons tool. This tool will provide the content of and the assessments for your module. At times you will be directed to join discussions with fellow students and complete activities and assessments before you can continue with the module. It is very important that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you log in at least once a week to do the following: • Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife e-mail account so that you receive the announcement e-mails on your cellphone. • Do the Discussion Forum activities. When you do the activities for each learning unit, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you will need to go online to post your messages. • Do other online activities. For some of the learning unit activities you might need to post something on the Blog tool, take a quiz or complete a survey under the Self-Assessment tool. Do not skip these activities because they will help you complete the assignments and the activities for the module. We hope that by giving you extra ways to study the material and practise all the activities, this will help you succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module, you MUST go online regularly to complete the activities and assignments on time. 8. ASSESSMENT 8.1 Assessment plan The following is a breakdown of the formal assessment activities as they become due during the year: COS3721/101/0/2022 9 Assignment Assessment type Year Mark Weight Formative assessments 1 Practical assessment 35% 2 Practical assessment 35% 3 Practical assessment 30% Because this is an online module, the assignments are not provided in this tutorial letter. Instead, the assignments are provided online as they become due. You will see them when you go online. 8.2 Year mark and final examination/other options Your year mark for this module is as follows: In this course, you will be assessed through three (3) compulsory practical assignments and a final theory examination. The assignments contribute towards a year mark. Assignments 1 and 2 contribute 35% each, and assignment 3 contributes 30% towards the year mark. Your year mark will then contribute 30% towards your final mark and the examination mark will contribute 70%. The assignments make up a year mark out of 100 towards the formative assessment. The exam mark counts 100% towards the summative assessments. The year mark and exam mark together make the final mark. Formative assessments (assignments) 30%+ Summative assessment 70% = Final mark. Assignment marks (30 % weight) + exam mark (70% weight) = Final mark Assignment1 mark *35% + Assignment 2 mark * 35% + Assignment 3 mark *30% = the assignment mark Assignment mark * 30% = year mark You must submit at least the first assignment before you can be admitted to the examination. Assessment marks ratio 1. Year mark: 30% 2. Exam mark: 70% COS3721/101/0/2022 10 Final Mark Assessment Weight Formative assessment -Assignments 30% Summative assessment - theory examination 70% *Because this is an online module, the assignment questions are not provided in this tutorial letter. Instead, the assignments are provided online as they become due. You will see them when you go online. 9. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY 9.1 Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of taking the words, ideas and thoughts of others and presenting them as your own. It is a form of theft which involves several dishonest academic activities, such as the following: • Cutting and pasting from any source without acknowledging the source. • Not including or using incorrect references. • Paraphrasing without acknowledging the original source of the information. 9.2 Cheating Cheating includes, but is not limited to, the following: • Completing assessments on behalf of another student, copying from another student during an assessment or allowing a student to copy from you. • Using social media (eg WhatsApp, Telegram) or other platforms to disseminate assessment information. Submitting corrupt or irrelevant files. • Buying completed answers from “tutors” or internet sites (contract cheating). 9.3 More information about plagiarism can be downloaded on the link below https://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/myunisa/default/Study-@-Unisa/Student-values-and-rules 10. STUDENT WITH DISABILITY The Advocacy and Resource Centre for Student with Disability (ARCSWiD) provides an opportunity for staff to interact with new and returning students with disabilities. • If you are a student with a disability and would like additional support or need additional time for assessments, you are invited to contact the lecturer so that you can be assisted.
