Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa. • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All of your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may not submit a physical hard-copy of your assignments. 7 • All of the communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate to you by e-mail, and using, for example, the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these ways to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 5.2 The myUnisa tools you will use All of the information about myUnisa tools is located under Unit 0 on the myUnisa website for this module. 6 ASSESSMENT The assessments are available on-line on the module site under ‘Additional Resources’. Please download them as soon as possible and start working on it as you work your way through the material. 6.1 Suggested study plan A semester is 13 weeks in duration which will give you adequate time to work your way through the material and subject matter. Week 1 starts on 05 February 2018 for semester 1, and on 16 July 2018 for semester 2. Here is a break-down of the formal activities and assignments, as they occur in the semester: 8 COS3751/101/3/2018 Week Content Additional Tasks 1 Learning Unit 0 and 1 2 Learning Unit 2 3 Learning Unit 3 4 Learning Unit 4 5 Learning Unit 5 Assignment 01 due at start of week 6 Learning Unit 6 7 Learning Unit 7 8 Learning Unit 8 9 Learning Unit 9 Assignment 02 due at start of week 10 Learning Unit 10 11 Review Self-assessment as- signment 01 due at start of week. Do not submit 12 Review 13 Review 6.2 Assignments This module consists of four assessment opportunities. These are three assignments which are formative assessment opportunities and one sit-down venue based examination which is the sum- mative assessment opportunity. Entrance to the summative assessment opportunity is dependent on completion and submission of the ﬁrst assignment: if you do not complete the ﬁrst assignment and submit it on myUnisa, you will not be allowed to write the ﬁnal examination. Assignments 01 and 02 are compulsory, and will contribute to your year mark. Self assessment as- signment 01 is a self-assessment assignment, and will not contribute to your year mark – however, it covers material that will be in the summative assessment (the exam) this means you have to com- plete it and use the model solutions that will be provided to determine your level of understanding of the work. The following table provides particulars about the assignments for each semester: Semester Assignment Due Date Unique Number Semester 1 Assignment 01 2018-03-05 698500 Semester 1 Assignment 02 2018-04-03 868331 Semester 2 Assignment 01 2018-08-13 801429 Semester 2 Assignment 02 2018-09-10 709589 9 Assignments are not mini-exams, and we do not treat them as such. Use this opportunity to gain a better understanding of the material covered in an assignment, by asking questions, and pointing out to us which parts of the assignment you found difﬁcult. A satisfactory assignment is one in which you put in a serious effort to answer all the questions. We strongly advise you to do all three assignments. We reserve the right to mark only a subset of the questions for each assignment. However, we will not reveal this before the closing date of the assignment, it is therefore important that you attempt to answer all of the questions in each assignment. The tutorial matter to study for each assignment appears in the study timetables. Give yourself enough time to do the assignments properly, realising that an hour or two will not be sufﬁcient. Some assignment questions may require additional research, which can be in the form of sources such as articles, books and web sites. It is important that the sources used contain recent and relevant information. Web addresses change frequently, therefore some URLs noted in the text- book and tutorial matter may have changed by the time you access them. You are encouraged to do some research on your own as and when needed. Follow the procedures outlined herein, in tutorial letter COSALL/301/4/2018 and in the brochure Studies @Unisa when submitting your assignments. Assignments should reach us by the due dates. Please do not contact us for exten- sions. Important: in the event that due dates are extended as a result of administrative problems, please attempt to keep to the original due dates as published for COS3751. The assignments are available on-line, on the myUnisa site for COS3751. 6.2.1 Mark Calculation The year mark is calculated as follows: Y = A1 2 × A2 2 (1) Where A1 is your mark for assignment 01 and A2 is your mark for assignment 02. Your ﬁnal mark is calculated as: FM = 4E 5 + Y 5 (2) Where E is your exam mark, and Y is your year mark. 10 COS3751/101/3/2018 6.2.2 Plagiarism Do not attempt to hand in answers from already published assignment solutions, this is plagiarism and you will be subjected to disciplinary action. An answer that resembles a published solution will also be awarded 0%. Please also do not simply copy and paste from on-line sources – there are many excellent sources on the web which explains and may even provide solutions to the questions in the assignments. However, presenting that to us as your own work is not only plagiarism, it also does not help you to prepare for the exam. 6.2.3 Submission All assignments have to be submitted on myUnisa. Assignments that are emailed to us, or that is handed in in hard-copy will be awarded 0%. 6.3 Relevant material to study The module makes use of chapters one to nine, and chapter 18 in the prescribed text-book. Each learning unit will provide and indication of the chapter(s) that should be studied. Each assignment also provides the relevant chapter from the textbook that should be studied in order to complete the assignment.
