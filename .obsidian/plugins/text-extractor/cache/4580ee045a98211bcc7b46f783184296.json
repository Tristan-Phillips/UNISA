Option 1: x1 ╟ ◊ q Option 2: x1 ╟ □ (p  q) Option 3: x2 ╟ ◊ p  □ q Option 4: x3 ╟ □ (p  ¬ q) Option 5: x4 ╟ □ (p  q) QUESTION 4 Which of the following formulas is true in the Kripke model given in Figure 1? Option 1: ◊ p Option 2: □ q Option 3: □ ◊ q Option 4: □ (p  q) Option 5: q  p QUESTION 5 Which of the following formulas is false in the Kripke model given in Figure 1? Option 1: p  q Option 2: □ ◊ p Option 3: □ (p  q) Option 4: p  ◊ q Option 5: □ p  ◊ q QUESTION 6 If we interpret □  as \"It ought to be that  \", which of the following formulas correctly expresses the English sentence It ought to be that if I am happy, I'm allowed to be unhappy. where p stands for the declarative sentence \"I am happy\"? 4 Option 1: □ p  ◊ ¬ p Option 2: ◊ ¬ p  ¬ □ p Option 3: □ (p  ¬ □ p) Option 4: □ (p  ¬ ◊ p) Option 5: It is impossible to translate this sentence into a formula of modal logic with the required interpretation. QUESTION 7 If we interpret □  as \"It is necessarily true that  \", why should the formula scheme □    hold in this modality? Option 1: Because for all formulas , it is necessarily true that if  then . Option 2: Because for all formulas , if  is necessarily true, then it is true. Option 3: Because for all formulas , if  is not possibly true, then it is true. Option 4: Because for all formulas ,  is necessarily true if it is true. Option 5: □    should not hold in this modality. QUESTION 8 If we interpret □  as \"After any execution of program P,  holds\", why should the formula scheme □    not hold in this modality? Option 1: Just because  holds after every execution of P doesn't necessarily mean that  holds before execution of P. Option 2: Because it is not that case that after any execution of P, if  holds then  holds. Option 3: Because if  does not hold before execution of P, it doesn't necessarily mean that  holds after any execution of P. Option 4: Because if  does not hold after every execution of P, it doesn't necessarily mean that  holds before any execution of P. Option 5: □    should hold in this modality, because if  holds after any execution of P, then  holds. QUESTION 9 If we interpret □  as \"Always in the future (where the future does not include the present) it will be true that  \", which of the following formulas should COS3761/203/1/2018 5 be valid? Option 1: □ p  □ □ p Option 2: ¬ □ p  ¬ ◊ ◊ ¬ p Option 3: ¬ ◊ ¬ p  □ p Option 4: ¬ □ □ p  ◊ ¬ p Option 5: All of the above are valid QUESTION 10 If we interpret □  as \"Agent A believes  \", what is the English translation of the formula □ p  ¬ ◊ q? Option 1: If Agent A believes p, then Agent B does not believe q. Option 2: Agent A believes that if p, then q is not consistent with Agent A's beliefs. Option 3: Agent A believes that if p, then Agent B does not believe q. Option 4: If Agent A believes p, then Agent A believes not q. Option 5: Agent A believes p if Agent A believes not q. QUESTION 11 If we interpret □  as \"Agent A believes  \", what formula will be correctly translated to English as Agent A does not believe p or q. Option 1: ◊ ¬ (p  q) Option 2: □ ¬ (p  q) Option 3: ¬ □ p  q Option 4: ◊ ¬ p  q Option 5: □ ¬ p  □ ¬ q 6 QUESTION 12 Consider the following Kripke frame: Which of the following modal logics does this frame conform to?

Option 1: None Option 2: □ elimination and □ introduction are both only used once. Option 3: □ elimination is used only once but □ introduction twice. Option 4: □ elimination is used twice but □ introduction only once. Option 5: □ elimination and □ introduction are both used twice. x1 x2 x3 x4 COS3761/203/1/2018 7 QUESTION 14 What is the correct reason for steps 1, 2 and 3 of the above proof?

Use axiom T to remove one □. Open a dashed box and use □ elimination to get p  q. Use  elimination twice to obtain the separate atomic formulas. Close the dashed box and use □ introduction twice, i.e. once on each of the atomic formulas. Combine □ p and □ q using  introduction. Close the solid box and use  introduction on the first and last formulas to get the result. COS3761/203/1/2018 9 Option 2: Start with □ □ (p  q) as a premise. Use axiom T twice to remove both □ to get p  q. Use  elimination once to obtain the separate atomic formulas. Use axiom 4 twice, i.e. once on each atomic formula to add a □. Combine □ p and □ q using  introduction. Use  introduction on the first and last formulas to get the result. Option 3: Start with □ □ (p  q) as a premise. Open a dashed box and use □ elimination to get □ (p  q). Open another dashed box and use □ elimination to get p  q. Use  elimination twice to obtain the separate atomic formulas. Close the first dashed box and use □ introduction on the first atomic formula. Close the second dashed box and use □ introduction on the second atomic formula. Combine □ p and □ q using  introduction. Use  introduction on the first and last formulas to get the result. Option 4: Open a solid box and start with □ □ (p  q) as an assumption. Open a dashed box and use □ elimination to get □ (p  q). Use axiom T to remove one □ to get p  q. Use  elimination twice to obtain the separate atomic formulas. Use axiom 4 twice, i.e. once on each atomic formula to add a □. Close the dashed box and combine □ p and □ q using  introduction. Close the solid box and use  introduction on the first and last formulas to get the result. Option 5: This is not a valid sequent in KT4.
