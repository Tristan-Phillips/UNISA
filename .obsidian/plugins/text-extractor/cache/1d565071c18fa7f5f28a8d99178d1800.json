Eat4Health: study case for this assignment Assume that you are a specialist on human-computer interaction (HCI). You were employed by the developers of an app that keeps track of users’ eating habits and nutrition, how many calories they take in on a daily basis and how many they burn, as well as the balance between carbohydrates, protein and fat. You may use any diet app of your choice, e.g. cronometer (https://cronometer.com/), MyFitnessPal (the diet aspects, https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), Keto Manager (https://ketomanager.com/), etc. Please mention which app you have used for this assignment. For the sake of the questions below, the app will be called Eat4Health. When you give an example, criticism or recommendation regarding the app in your answers, you have to be specific to prove that you have done an in-depth review of the app’s functionalities and HCI/interaction design aspects. INF3720/103/02/2020 3 Question 1 Total: 20 marks Assume that you have been asked to do the interactive design for the new version of the Eat4Health app. (Please mention the real-life app that you have used.) You have to decide between unstructured interviews, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, observation and questionnaires to gather data from all the role players that will be involved in the new version of the app. Define each of these data gathering techniques; mention their advantages and disadvantages; and give one question that acts as an example for each type of technique in relation to the stated case. (Hint: you have to mention the Eat4Health app in each example question – be specific.) Use the following table structure for your answer: INF3720/103/02/2020 4 Q1. Model answer: I have used the following diet app: MyFitnessPal (via Garmin) Type of interview Definition Advantages Disadvantages Example question a) Unstruc- tured interview [4] [pp. 268-9] Open-ended questions are asked to various respondents to gain a basic understanding of a problem case, and the consultant needs a basic agenda to be covered.  It is ideal to gain a deep understanding (rich data) of an unknown field.  It is difficult to summarise data; and statistical analysis is not possible. Time- consuming.  Please tell me about the required functionalities of the MyFitnessPal app.  b) Semi- structured interview [4] [pp. 269- 270] The researcher uses specific, pre- planned questions to guide the interview, but may probe deeper based on the participant’s answers.  It is ideal to gain a rich understanding of a known field or problem area.  It is not suitable for quantitative research and is limited to the basic predetermined structure.  The interviewer’s body language may influence the participant. What are the current deficiencies of the MyFitnessPal app? ... You said users have to scroll month-by- month to select their birthday – how could this be improved ideally? c) Focus group [4] [pp. 271- 272] The consultant meets with a small group of people (representative off the target group) and facilitates a discussion (asking them semi- structured questions).  One can get more feedback in the same time frame, and respondents can discuss shared issues with one another. Diverse and sensitive issues can be raised. Participants with strong opinions can dominate discussions.  Person X, you have been very quiet so far – please tell me what you think about the current functionalities of the MyFitnessPal app.  d) Obser-vation [4] [pp. 287- 300] Users are working with the product in a laboratory setting and their interaction is being observed (during direct observation). Observation in the field: users’ behaviour in natural environments is studied.  This allows the consultant to see first-hand with which functionalities users struggle without being interrupted.  Users may feel nervous and intimidated by being observed. Time-consuming. Large sets of data created.  Dear user(s), please try to connect via the Garmin app to the MyFitnessPal app and note any difficulties that you may experience.  e) Question- naire [4] [pp. 278- 283] Usually very exact, structured/close- ended questions are asked to large groups of people (but the questions can be open- ended as well).  Quantitative analysis of the data is possible in structured questionnaires. General patterns can be identified. Remote participants can be involved.  It is not possible to probe deeper into any interesting issues brought up by the participants using structured questionnaires. Weak design cannot be fixed during the research. On a scale of 1 (bad) to 5 (good), please state how frustrating it was for you to select your birthday on the MyFitnessPal app.  INF3720/103/02/2020 5 Question 2 Total: 20 marks Briefly discuss the concepts of persona, scenario and use case. Develop a persona and scenario for the new version of the Eat4Health app in order to improve the usability and user experience of the app. Also compile an essential use case for one functionality of the new version of the Eat4Health app (e.g. to keep track of the balance of your diet’s carbohydrates, protein and fat and to make recommendations on improving your dietary habits). (20) Q2. Model answer: Persona – See pp. 403-407. A persona is an example of a typical foreseen user of the app  ; a “synthesis of a number of real users  ... based on a set of user profiles ”; describes realistic not idealised exemplar person ; represents unique set of goals for a product functionality ; describes typical user’s “behavior, attitudes, activities, and environment.”  (Max. 3.) Scenario (4) – See pp. 408-414. A scenario is an example of a typical (foreseen) interaction of a typical user with one of the app’s functionalities or in real life . It is a narrative/story that allows the HCI consultant to understand users’ environments and requirements for software . The story reveals users’ goals and motivations . It identifies stakeholders and artifacts involved  as well as any assumptions and constraints . It may also illustration potential behaviours with a new app.  (Max. 3.) Use case (4) – See pp. 415-416. Uses cases capture requirements and interaction . It describes a process step-by-step . An essential use case shows how tasks are divided between the system/app and the user.  It “focuses on user intentions and product responsibilities”.  A detailed use case describes the common set of actions in a list form, as well as alternative courses.  (Max. 3.) Developing a persona for MyFitnessPal to improve the usability and user experience for the app (4): The typical group of users for MyFitnessPal described here is a 50-year old male  who has been diagnosed as overweight and having coronary artery calcification – his fictional name is Tebogo . Tebogo’s doctor advised him to walk 3 km every morning at a brisk pace and to limit his calory intake. Tebogo wants to lose 12 kilograms over the next 12 months.  To motivate him, he considers buying a fitness tracker that can calculates his calorie intake and output and keep track of his new exercise routine.  (Max. 3.) Developing a scenario for MyFitnessPal to improve the usability and user experience for the app (4): Tebogo bought a Garmin Vivo Active 4 fitness tracker and wants to use the Calories In/Out functionality on the Garmin Connect app . He has to register as a user of MyFitnessPal first and link the two apps . He has to load his birthday manually and has to scroll back to his birthday date month-by-month (> 150 clicks) . He finds this frustrating and wishes he bought another fitness tracker with an easier human-computer interaction design for this function.  (Max. 3.) Compiling an essential use case for one functionality of the new version of MyFitnessPal (4) – how to register one’s age when connecting the app with Garmin’s Health & Performance-Calories In/Out function: registerAge  USER INTENTION  SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITY  activate Calories In/Out function on Garmin Connect ½ send user’s details to MyFitnessPal  ½ confirm registration with MyFitnessPal  ½ request age from Garmin Connect  ½ confirm details and age  ½ show integrated information on one screen ½ accept account terms and conditions  ½ send SMS with target weight and suggested diet and exercise programme ½ (Max. 5.) INF3720/103/02/2020 6 Question 3 Total: 15 marks 3.1 Briefly discuss the three types of evaluation and mention one argument or consideration for and against each type. (5) 3.2 When a prototype of the new version of the Eat4Health app becomes available, you will have to do a usability testing of it before it is released to the public. You have decided to do a field study of the pilot version “in-the-wild”. Give some guidelines with examples that can be used to facilitate such an evaluation process for the prototype of the new version of the Eat4Health app. (10) Q3. Model answer: 3.1 Three types of evaluation with an argument for or against each – See pp. 500-507 (Max. 5.) 1) “Controlled settings directly involving users” ½, e.g. conducting an experiment in a lab to test a software product’s usability ½ – this is ideal to test hypotheses and to observe or measure users’ behaviour ; this type is good to disclose usability problems, but is not suitable to reveal the context of use.  [Max. 2.] 2) “Natural settings involving users” ½, e.g. field studies that are done online or in public ½; this type is ideal to establish how apps are used in the real world , but is time-consuming, does not allow control of users’ activities, and may be difficult to conduct.  [Max. 2.] 3) Settings without direct user involvement ½, e.g. “inspections, heuristics, walk-throughs, models, and analytics” ½ – these can be done quickly , but can miss subtle facets of user experience or probing into user’s feelings and motivations.  [Max. 2.] 3.2 Guidelines for facilitating the evaluation of a prototype of a new version of the MyFitnessApp during a field study – See pp. 514-519 (Max. 10.) 1) The HCI consultant may evaluate the prototype of the new version of the MyFitnessApp in natural settings (in the field/in-the-wild), for example in a gym.  2) The HCI consultant should develop unique data collection and analysis techniques to evaluate users’ needs when using the new version of the MyFitnessApp in natural settings, such as to check their calories burnt against their daily calory intake while they are exercising, e.g. using voice notes rather than paper- based forms.  3) The HCI consultant can use crowdsourcing by using the internet to collect data from online Garmin Connect users (with their permission).  4) The HCI consultant should inform all participants about their rights, e.g. to withdraw at any time – it would be ideal to identify participants and send them the necessary background information before they start participating.  5) The HCI consultant should get written consent from all participants – since digital media are used, this could be done by sending an SMS or WhatsApp message, but the consent should be stored and archived.  6) The HCI consultant should choose the right method to collect relevant data, e.g. semi-structured interviews to find out how Garmin users feel about the improved birthday registration method on the new version of the MyFitnessApp.  7) The HCI consultant should ensure that the research is reliable/dependable: is there an audit trail that can be used to track and check the research?  8) The HCI consultant should ensure that the research is valid/trustworthy: are the findings accurate?  9) The HCI consultant should ensure that the research is ecologically valid: how could the research environment affect the research results, e.g. how can gym buddies influence a participant’s answers if the research is done in the gym?  10) The HCI consultant should ensure that the research is not biased (objective/confirmable): is it possible for an auditor to judge if the research results are feasible?  11) The HCI consultant should ensure that the scope of the research is wide enough to be generalisable/transferable: can readers or users judge whether the results are applicable to similar situations, e.g. can users’ feelings about registering their birthdate on MyFitnessPal be applied to other fitness or dieting apps?  (Cf. Oates, B., 2006, Researching Information Systems and Computing, Los Angeles, CA: Sage, p. 294 for the last five points.) INF3720/103/02/2020 7 Question 4 Total: 15 marks The ICT Manager of the Eat4Health company asked you to do a usability study of the current version of the app in a controlled laboratory setting. 4.1 Plan the study by discussing relevant aspects in terms of possible methods, the selection of participants and the tasks that will be required of them. Refer to the relevant theoretical principles and apply them to the Eat4Health app. (6) 4.2 Explain to the CEO what you would need in terms of labs and equipment to do the testing, and motivate your needs with reference to the Eat4Health app. (4) 4.3 What aspects will be covered on the informed consent form to be signed by each participant? Give an example of each aspect with reference to the current version of the Eat4Health app. (5) INF3720/103/02/2020 8 Q4. Model answer – Planning for a usability study of the current version of the MyFitnessApp in a controlled laboratory setting 4.1 Discussion of relevant aspects in terms of possible methods, the selection of participants and the tasks that will be required of them: Max. 6 pp. 524-525 Theoretical principles Practical Eat4Health app application (usability study of the current version of the MyFitnessApp in a controlled laboratory setting) Possible relevant methods: Video recording of user behaviour and emotional reaction, or users asked to think aloud while registering their age on the current version of MyFitnessApp, or users asked to fill out a user satisfaction questionnaire; interviews; performance timing; counting actions; carried out; recording number of errors; etc. Calculating the time to complete the task to register your age (see below), as well as the number of navigations and errors could reveal poor usability of the current functionality in MyFitnessApp.  Selection of participants: At least 5-12 users should be involved, they should represent a realistic sample of all typical users of the product (Garmin Connect).  A balanced sample of new, intermediate and experienced users of Garmin Connect.  Tasks required of participants: The participants should be asked to carry out the functionality that is being evaluated and considered for improvement. Sample asked to start using the Calories In/Out function – they should connect to MyFitnessApp and register their age.  4.2 Explanation to the CEO of what the HCI consultant would need in terms of labs and equipment to do the testing (max. 2): Max. 4, see pp. 525-528 The consultant needs a usability lab where the participants' actions can be recorded on video and with microphones.  Real-world interruptions should be minimised ; or an observation room is needed; or mobile/remote testing equipment; or eye-tracking equipment. Motivation of his/her needs with reference to the Eat4Health/MyFitnessPal app (max. 2): A lab is needed to exclude real-world interruptions ; video recording is necessary for careful analysis of user behaviour and emotional reactions ; audio recording is needed for thinking-aloud capturing while registering one’s age on MyFitnessPal. 4.3 Aspects to be covered on the informed consent form to be signed by each participant (max. 3): see pp. 262-264 Participants should sign that they have been informed of their right not to participate ; to withdraw at any time ; of having been informed sufficiently about the nature of the research ; their right to anonymity and confidentiality. An example of each aspect with reference to the current version of the Eat4Health app. (max. 2): The Garmin user has the right to disallow Garmin to share your details with the HCI consultants.  If the Garmin user feels uncomfortable about continuing her involvement in the research, she may withdraw at any time.  The user should be informed that her participation will be used to improve the birthday registration functionality. The user should be informed that her personal data will not be shared with anyone and will be kept confidential. INF3720/103/02/2020 9 Question 5 Total: 30 marks Assume the role of an expert evaluator and do a heuristic evaluation of the current version of the Eat4Health app yourself. List all ten of Nielsen’s heuristics and apply each one to a related problem using the table format below. Also indicate one positive aspect where the Eat4Health app does it right. (Hint: you have to mention the Eat4Health app in each example question – be specific.) Use the following table structure for your answer: INF3720/103/02/2020 10 Q5. Model answer: Heuristics (10) pp. 550-551 Problems related to the Eat4Health app (10) Apply each heuristic – identify one problem related to Garmin/MyFitnessPal (MFP) app for each heuristic. Examples where the Eat4Health app does it right (10) Apply each heuristic – identify one positive aspect for each heuristic where Garmin/MyFitnessPal (MFP) app does it right. 1. Heuristic 1: Visibility of system status  MFP does not show the remaining calorie goal (to be burnt) on Garmin unless the user recorded calories consumed in MFP itself. Garmin shows the user’s daily calorie goal and remaining calories (assuming that the user recorded it on MFP).  2. Heuristic 2: Match between system and real world  Users may find calorie counting confusing. The app should rather say: “You have not yet burnt enough calories today.” The app is smart to take into account calories consumed during activities when calculating the daily goal. 3. Heuristic 3: User control and freedom  The Garmin user cannot insert calories consumed directly in Connect. The Garmin user can log calories using the button “Log Calories in MFP”. 4. Heuristic 4: Consistency and standards  Garmin Connect uses a graph to show a week’s calories burnt on the Calories button, but on Calories In/Out & MFP it shows only one day’s data. It is not clear of calories refer to calories consumed or burnt. The number of calories earned during exercise correlates 100% between the Calories and Calories In/Out functions.  5. Heuristic 5: Error prevention  When registering one’s age on MFP, there seems to be no checking with the user’s recorded data in Garmin Connect – you can insert any birthday.  The user can add calories consumed in fat, carbs or protein in MFP using food names, e.g. egg large = 72. 6. Heuristic 6: Recognition rather than recall  The need to use two apps to manage your weight in Garmin/MFP is cumbersome. The two apps use different interfaces which may confuse the user. Both the Calories (burnt) function and the Calories In/Out are found in the Health & Performance menu in Connect.  7. Heuristic 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use  Linking two apps hampers flexibility. Scrolling month-by-month for your birthday is very inefficient.  Integrating exercise data from Garmin within MFP is an accelerator that may speed up the interaction of the user with the two apps. 8. Heuristic 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design  The MFP app shows irritating advertisements on the version that comes with the Garmin connect app. These hamper the minimalist design.  The weekly calories burnt graphs on Connect ensures a minimalist and aesthetically pleasing interface (seeing a whole week’s data in a glance).  9. Heuristic 9: Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors  If the user clicks on “Consumed” in Calories In/Out, nothing happens. An error message should have referred one to the Log Calories in MFP button. There is a basic help function in Calories In/Out giving short definitions of the terms used and linking these to the user’s daily stats. 10. Heuristic 10: Help and documentation  No detailed help documentation is referred to in the Calories In/Out interface. The user should be referred to consult the Garmin user manual. A Help function is available on MFP using troubleshooting based on diagnostic codes (but the frequently asked questions facility is empty!).  Total: 100 © Unisa 2020","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
