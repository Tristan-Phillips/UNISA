The aim of FATE is to make decisions made by computer systems just and fair. www.id-book.com Summary • This chapter discussed how data at scale is collected, analyzed and communicated. • The data can be qualitative or qualitative. • It comes from different sources – eg sensors, social media, documents, facial recognition data. • Privacy is a big concern because data from different sources can be brought together to reveal patterns of behavior. • The FATE frameworks suggests ethical principles to guide UX design: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Explainability. www.id-book.com","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
