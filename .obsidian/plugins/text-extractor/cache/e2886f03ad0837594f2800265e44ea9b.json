Let 𝒈 be a function from Z+ (the set of positive integers) to Q (the set of rational numbers) defined by (𝒙, 𝒚) ∈ 𝒈 iff 𝒚 = 4𝒙 − 3/7(𝒈 ⊆ Z + × Q) and let 𝒇 be a function on Z+ defined by (𝒙, 𝒚) ∈ 𝒇 iff 𝒚 = 5𝒙2 + 2𝒙 − 3( 𝒇 ⊆ Z + × Z +) Consider the function 𝒇 on Z+. For which values of 𝒙 is it the case that 5𝒙2 + 2𝒙 − 3 > 0? 5𝑥2 + 2𝑥 − 3 > 0 ⇒ (5𝑥 − 3)(𝑥 + 1) > 0 For the equation to be positive, either both terms are negative, or both terms are positive. (i) Both terms are negative. 5𝑥 − 3 < 0 AND 𝑥 + 1 < 0 ⇒ 5𝑥 < 3 AND 𝑥 < −1 ⇒ 𝑥 < 3 5 AND 𝑥 < −1 As both conditions need to be true, take the one that includes both terms. For example, the number 0 satisfies the first term, but not the second. But every number that satisfies the second term also satisfies the first. 𝑥 < −1 However, 𝑥 is only defined on Z+, so 𝑥 ≰ 0. Therefore, there are no 𝑥 values where both terms can be negative. (ii) Both terms are positive. 5𝑥 − 3 > 0 AND 𝑥 + 1 > 0 ⇒ 5𝑥 > 3 AND 𝑥 > −1 ⇒ 𝑥 > 3 5 AND 𝑥 > −1 As both conditions need to be true, take the one that includes both terms. For example, the number 0 satisfies the second term, but not the first. But every number that satisfies the first term also satisfies the second. 𝑥 > 3 5 But we know that 𝑥 is only defined on Z+. So 𝑥 has to be equal to, or bigger than the nearest positive integer that is greater than 3/5, which would be 1. So, 𝑥 ≥ 1 where 𝑥 ∈ Z +","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
