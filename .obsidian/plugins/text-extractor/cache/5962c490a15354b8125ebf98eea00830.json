To load the macros, simply put \\input{fitch.sty} near the beginning of your LATEX \fle. Here is a natural deduction derivation, together with the code that produced it: 1 2 Details 2.1 Guards Some natural deduction derivations with quanti\fers use guards, as in the following example: 1 2.5 Scope The commands \\hypo, \\have, \\open, \\close, \\r, \\ii, and so forth are only available inside an nd environ- ment. These commands may have a di\u000berent meaning elsewhere in the same document. The only commands provided by the fitch.sty package which are visible outside an nd environment are the command \\ndref described in Section 2.4, and the command \\nddim and the dimension \\ndindent described in Section 2.9. 2.6 Breaking it across pages The nd environment is derived from the LATEX array environment, and thus it does not break across pages automatically. However, if a derivation is too long to \ft on a single page, it is possible to split it manually into physically independent, but logically consecutive subparts. For this purpose, the ndresume environment is provided to continue a previously interrupted derivation. Here is an example: 1 12.9 Customizing dimensions The relative sizes of the various elements of a natural deduction proof are preset to reasonable values depending on the size of the currently selected font. However, it will sometimes be necessary to customize these dimensions. This can be achieved with the \\nddim command. The syntax of the command is as follows: \\nddim{height}{topheight}{depth}{labelsep}{indent}{hsep}{justsep}{linethickness}; where each of the eight parameters is a dimension. The meaning of the \frst seven parameters is shown in the following illustrations; linethickness is simply the thickness of the lines. P Q 1 Rule 2labelsep depth topheight The default dimensions are: \\nddim{4.5ex}{3.5ex}{1.5ex}{1em}{1.6em}{.5em}{2.5em}{.2mm}: In addition, there is a dimension called \\ndindent, controls the amount of extra indentation used on con- tinuation lines as discussed in Section 2.8. It can be changed and is 1ex by default. 2.10 Other comments The goal was to design a \rexible package which would not impose any constraints on the form of derivations, while making typesetting easy. With this package, it is in fact possible to typeset incomplete, ill-formed, or invalid derivations. Sometimes it is pedagogically necessary to do so. There are no arbitrary limits on the size or nesting depth of a derivation, except for the obvious requirement of \ftting horizontally on the printed page. 3 Copyright and license The following notice applies to the fitch.sty macros.
