(4) (ii) Show that  is not valid by constructing a mathematical model (where the universe A of concrete values is the set of integers). Explain why your model falsifies . (4) (i) Model M where the sentence is true: A : the set of integers (given) R M : We interpret R(x, y) as “x > y” (or …) fM: We interpret f(x) as “x-10” (or …) COS3761 May/June 2017 In this interpretation the formula states that for all integers x and y, if x > y then x > y-10. which is obviously true. (ii) Model M where the sentence is false: A : the set of integers (given) R M : We interpret R(x, y) as “x = 2 times y” (or …) fM: We interpret f(x) as “x-10” (or …) In this interpretation the formula states that for all integers x and y, the formula is not valid in this interpretation since there are values for ax and y for which the formula is false. For example x = 8 and y = 4. the antecedent namely R(x, y) is true since 8 = 2*4 . However the consequent namely R(x, f(y)) is false , since 8 is not equal to 4 – 10= (- 6) QUESTION 3 [34] Question 3.1 Consider the following Kripke model with worlds x1, x2, x3 and x4: For each of the following relations, determine whether it holds in the above Kripke model and give reasons for your answer: (12) (i) x1 ╟ □ p (ii) x2 ╟ □ (p  q) (iii) x3 ╟ □ p  ◊ q (iv) x₄ ╟ □ □ ¬ p (i). The formula is true in world x₁ because p is true in all the worlds accessible from x₁ namely x₂ and x₄. Therefore □ p is true in x₁. p, q p, q p x₁ x₃ x₄ p x₂ COS3761 May/June 2017 (ii). The formula is true in world x₂ because p  q is true in x₃, and since x₃ is the only world accessible from x₂. Therefore □ (p  q) is true in x₂. (iii). The formula is true in world x₃ because □ p is true in x3 since p is true in all worlds accessible from x₃, namely x₃ and x₄. Also ◊ q is true in x₃ since x₃ is accessible to itself. (iv). The formula is true in world x₄ because there are no worlds accessible from x₄. Question 3.2 Suppose we want to re-engineer basic modal logic to fit the following reading of □ : □ : The agent believes that . For each of the following two formulas, state whether it should be valid or not and explain your answer in both cases. (i) (□   )  (  □ ) (3) This should not be valid: If the agent believes , it need not really be true, and if  is true, it is possible that the agent does not believe it (ii) □    □ □   (3) This should be valid: If the agent believes  , the agent believes that he believes  . Question 3.3 Say we interpret the modal operators □ and ◊ to represent the temporal notions \"Always\" and \"sometimes\" respectively, and say we interpret the propositional letters p and q to mean \"It rains today\" and \"There will be sudden floods\" respectively. (i) Express the following modal logic formula in English: ¬ □ (p  q) (2) It is not always true that if it rains today, there will be sudden floods. (ii) Translate the following declarative sentence into modal logic: Even though it doesn't rain today sometime in the future there will be sudden floods. COS3761 May/June 2017 ¬ p ∧ ◊ q (2) Question 3.4 (i) Express the following sentence in modal logic where Ki is read as “Agent i knows that”: Agent 1 knows p but he doesn't know that agent 2 knows q (3) K₁ p ∧ ¬ K₁ K₂ q (ii) Express the following modal logic formula in English where Ki is read as “Agent i knows that”: K₁ K₂ ¬ q → p (3) If agent 1 knows that agent 2 knows not q, then p Question 3.5 Using the basic natural deduction rules, the □ introduction and elimination rules of the basic modal logic K as well as the following three additional rules for KT45 □  □   □  (6) T 4 5  □ □  □  □  prove the validity of the following sequent: □ (p  q), □  q ├ ◊  p We write ◊ as  □ . So we have to prove the following: □ (p  q),  □ q ├  □   p or, equivalently: □ (p  q),  □ q ├  □ p COS3761 May/June 2017 1 □ (p  q) premise 2  □ q premise 3 □ p assumption 4 p □ e 3 5 p  q □ e 1 6 q  e 4, 5 7 □ q □ i 4 - 6 8   e 7, 2 9  □ p  i 3 - 8","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
