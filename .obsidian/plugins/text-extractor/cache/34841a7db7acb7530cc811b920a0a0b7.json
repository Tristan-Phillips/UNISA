Please note the following: - The exam end time has been extended to 11h45. This means you don't have to login straight away if you don't want to. If students log in at different times during the available period it may alleviate the problems with system load - You will still only have 1 hour to complete each session, but if the system is busy, and you cannot get in, wait 15 minutes before you try again. There will be a second attempt for those who want to make use of it. Just remember that you will get a new set of questions. Keep the end time of 11h45 in mind. - | am available on email, but please understand that if 1200 students email me or phone me | do not have time to answer emails - If you get error messages, please send me screenshots. If images in questions do not display, 9 Â© -","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
