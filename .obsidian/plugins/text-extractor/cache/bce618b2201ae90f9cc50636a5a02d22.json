Option 1: world x₁ For ◊ p  □ q to be true in world x₁ ,◊ p should be true in world x₁ and □ q should be true in world x₁.For ◊ p to be true in world x₁ , p must be true in at least one world accessible from x₁.The worlds accessible from x₁ is x₁, x₂ and x₄. where p is true in x₁ . Also q is true in all the worlds accessible from x₁. Therefore the entire formula is true in world x₁... Option 2: world x₂ For ◊ p  □ q to be true in world x₂, ,◊ p should be true in world x₂ and □ q should be true in world x₂.For ◊ p to be true in world x₂, there should be at least one world accessible from x₂ where p is true .The world accessible from x₂ is x₁ and x₃ where p is true. For □ q to be true in world x₂, q must be true in all All the worlds accessible from x₂ which are and x₃ but q is false in x₁ .Therefore the formula is not true in world x₂ Option 3: world x₃, For ◊ p  □ q to be true in world x₃, ◊ p should be true in world x₃ and □ q should be true in world x₃ .For ◊ p to be true in world x₃,p must be true in at least one world accessible from x₃ The only world accessible from x₃ is x₄. But p is false in world x₄. Therefore the formula is not true in x₃. Option 4: Option 1 and Option 3 is true. Option 5: The formula is not true in any world of the Kripke model. p, q q p q q x₁ x₄ x₃ q q 4 QUESTION 2 Which of the following does not hold in the Kripke model in Figure 1? Option 1: x₁ ╟ ◊ ◊ p The relation holds. For ◊ ◊ p to be true in x₁, there must be at least one world accessible from x₁, where ◊ p is true. The world accessible from x₁ are x₂ and x₄. ◊ p is true in x₂ since x₃ is accessible from x₂ and p is true in x₃ Therefore the relation holds. Option 2: x₂ ╟ □ p The relation holds. For □ p to be true in world x₂, p must be true in all the worlds accessible from x₂ which are x₃ and x₁. Therefore the relation holds. Option 3: x₃ ╟ □ p  □ q The relation does not hold. For □ p  □ q to be true in x₃ , both of □ p and □ q must be true in world x₃ . In other words both p and q must be true in all worlds accessible from x₃ . The only world accessible from x₃ which is x₄ where p is false. Therefore relation does not hold. Option 4: x₄ ╟ □□ p For □□ p to be true in x₄, □ p must be true in all worlds accessible from x₄, namely x₂. For □ p to be true in x₂, namely x₁ and x₃. p is true in x₁ and x₃, so the relation holds. Option 5: None of the above options are true COS3761/202 5 QUESTION 3 Which of the following holds in the Kripke model given in Figure 1? Option 1: x₁ ╟ □ p For □ p to be true in world x₁ ,p must be true in all the worlds accessible from x₁ which are world x₂, and world x₄ . But neither the worlds x₂ and x₄ have p in them. Therefore the relation does not hold. Option 2: x₂ ╟ ◊( p  q ) For ◊( p  q) to be true in world x₂, p  q must be true in atleast one world accessible from x₂.The worlds accessible from x₂ are x₁ and x₃ . p  q is true in x₁ . Therefore the relation holds. Option 3: x₃ ╟ ◊ p  □ ¬ q For ◊ p  □ ¬ q to be true in world x₃, both ◊ p and □ ¬ q must be true in world x₃. But ◊ p is false in x₃because p is not true in the world accessible from x₃. namely . x₄.Therefore the relation does not hold. Option 4: x₄ ╟ □ (p  q) For □ (p  q) to be true in world x₄, p  q must be true in all the worlds accessible from x₄ which is x₂.But p is not true in world x₂. .Therefore the relation does not hold. Option 5: None of the options above holds in the given Kripke model in Figure 1. QUESTION 4 Which of the following formulas is true in the Kripke model given in Figure 1? Option 1: ◊ p The formula is false in the worlds x₃ because there is no world accessible from x₃ in which p is true. Therefore the formula does not hold in the Kripke model in Figure1. 6 Option 2: □ q The formula is false in the world x₂ because x₁ is accessible from x₂ and q is not true there. Therefore the formula does not hold in the Kripke model figure 1. Option 3: □ ◊ q The formula holds in the Kripke model Figure1 as it is true in all the worlds in the given Kripke model. Check this yourself. Option 4: □ p The formula does not hold as it is false in the worlds x₁, x₃ and x₄. Check this yourself. Option 5: None of the options above is true in the Kripke model in Figure 1. QUESTION 5 Which of the following formulas is false in the Kripke model given in Figure 1? Option 1: p  q The formula is true in all the worlds in the Kripke model in Figure 1. Option 2: □ ◊ p The formula is false in world x₃. because the worlds accessible from x₃. Option 3: □ (p  q) The formula is true in all worlds in the Kripke model in Figure 1. Option 4: p  ◊ q In world x₁, p is true and ◊ q is also true. This implies that world accessible from x₁, is world x₂ where q is also true. Therefore the formula is true in x₁. In world x₂, p is false but the world accessible from x₂ which is x₃ where q is true. Therefore the formula is true in x₂. In world x₃ ,p is true and ◊ q is also true in world c because the world accessible from x₃ is the world x₄ where q is true. Therefore the formula is true in x₃. In world x₄, p is false but ◊ q is true because the world accessible from world x₄ is world x₂ where q is true. Therefore the formula is true in x₄.. Option 5: None of the above options are false in the Kripke model in Figure 1. QUESTION 6 If we interpret □  as \"It ought to be that  \", which of the following formulas correctly expresses the English sentence It ought to be that if I will get a gold medal then I it is permitted that I will get a gold medal. COS3761/202 7 where p stands for the declarative sentence \"I will get a gold medal\"? Option 1: □ (p ¬ □ ¬ p) Option 2: □( p ¬ ◊ p) Option 3: □ p  ◊ ¬ p Option 4: □ p  □ p Option 5: It is impossible to translate this sentence into a formula of modal logic with the required interpretation. QUESTION 7 If we interpret □  as \"It is necessarily true that  \", why should the formula scheme □   □ □  hold in this modality? Option 1: Because for all formulas , it is necessarily true that if  then . Option 2: Because for all formulas , if  is necessarily true, then it is necessary that it is necessarily true. Option 3: Because for all formulas , if  is not possibly true, then it is true. Option 4: Because for all formulas ,  is necessarily true if it is true. Option 5: □   □ □  should not hold in this modality QUESTION 8 If we interpret □  as \"After any execution of program P,  holds\", why should the formula scheme □   ◊  not hold in this modality? Option 1: Because it is not the case that if  holds after every execution P, then  does not hold after some execution of P. Option 2: Because for a program P that never executes correctly, there is no execution of P after which  holds. Option 3: Because even if there is some execution of P after which  does not hold, it doesn't mean that  does not hold after any execution of P. Option 4: Because there may be a program P such that even though  holds after every execution P,  does not hold after some execution. Option 5: □   ◊  should hold in this modality, because if  holds after every execution of P, it should hold after at least one execution of P. 8 QUESTION 9 If we interpret □  as \"Always in the future (where the future does not include the present) it will be true that  \", which of the following formulas should be valid? Option 1: □ p  p Option 2: □ p  □ □ p Option 3: □ p  ◊ p Option 4: □ p  □ ¬ p Option 5: All of these formulas should hold in this modality. QUESTION 10 If we interpret □  as \"Agent A believes  \", what is the English translation of the formula □ p  □ ◊ q? Option 1: If agent A believes p then agent B believes not q. Option 2: If agent A believes p then he believes that agent B does not believe q. Option 3: If agent A believes p then he believes that he does not believe q. Option 4: Agent A believes p and he believes that agent B believes not q. Option 5: Agent A believes p but he doesn't believe q. QUESTION 11 If we interpret □  as \"Agent A believes  \", what formula will be correctly translated to English as If agent A believes p then he believes not q Option 1: □ p  □ ¬ q Option 2: □ (p  ¬ q) Option 3: □ p  ◊ q Option 4: □ p  ◊ ¬ q Option 5: ◊ (¬ p  ¬ q) QUESTION 12 COS3761/202 9 If we interpret Kᵢ as agent I knows , the formula scheme ¬  K₁ ¬ K₁  means Option 1: If  is true then agent 1 knows that he does not know  Option 2: If  is false then agent 1 knows that he does not know  Option 3: If  is true then agent 1 knows that he knows  Option 4: If  is false then agent 1 knows that he knows  Option 5: None of the above is correct The following natural deduction proof (without reasons) is referred to in Questions 13, 14 and 15: 1 ¬ □ ¬ (p  q) premise 2 □ p 3 □ ¬ q 4 p  q assumption 5 p □ e 2 6 q  e 4, 5 7 ¬ q □ e 3 8  ¬ e 6, 7 9 ¬ (p  q) ¬ i 4 - 8 10 □ ¬ (p  q) □ i 4 - 9 11  ¬ e 10, 1 12 ¬ □ ¬ q ¬ i 3 - 11 13 □ p  ¬ □ ¬  i 2 – 12 QUESTION 13 How many times are □ elimination and introduction rules used in the above proof? 10 Option 1: None Option 2: □ elimination and □ introduction once are both used only once. Option 3: □ elimination is used only once but □ introduction twice. Option 4: □ elimination is used twice but □ introduction only once. Option 5: □ elimination and □ introduction are both used twice.
