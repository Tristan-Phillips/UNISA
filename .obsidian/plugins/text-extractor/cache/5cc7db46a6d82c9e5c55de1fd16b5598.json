What is the aim logical database design stage? What are the phase/activities of logical design stage? [13] Ans The aim of the logical design stage is to map the conceptual module into a logical model which can be implemented on a relational DBMS. The logical design stage consists of the following phases/activities: 1. Creating the logical data model. 2. Validating the logical data model using normalization. 3. Assigning and validating integrity constraints. 4. Merging logical models constructed for different parts for the database together. 5. Reviewing the logical data model with the user. [Refer to Chapter 11 pp 578-587] 1.2 Distinguish between the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the Database Life Cycle (DBLC). Note: focus your answer on the main differences – diagrams are not necessary [6] Ans [Marker – use own discretion, answer need not to be exactly the same] The SDLC traces the history (life cycle) of an information system. The DBLC traces the history (life cycle) of a database system. SDLC is composed of five (5) phases  (i.e. planning, analysis, detailed system design, implementation, and maintenance).  DBLC consists of (6) phases (i.e. database initial study, database design, implementation and loading, testing and evaluation, operation, and maintenance and evolution)  INF3703/202 6 [Refer to Chapter 10 pp 536 - 538] 1.3 Briefly explain the main relationship between Information Systems and Database Systems? Provide a practical example. [4] Ans Information Systems deals with a variety of issues such as data collection, storage and retrieval. It also facilitates the transformation of data into information and the management of both data and information.  Whilst Database systems are one form of Information Systems and basically deals with data.  [Refer to Chapter 10] 1.4 Suppose your database system has failed. Describe the database recovery process. [7] Ans Recovery restores a database from a given state, usually inconsistent, to a previously consistent state.  Depending on the type and the extent of the failure, the recovery process ranges from a minor short-term inconvenience to a major long-term rebuild action. Regardless of the extent of the required recovery process, recovery is not possible without backup.  The database recovery process generally follows a predictable scenario: 1. Determine the type and the extent of the required recovery.  2. If the entire database needs to be recovered to a consistent state, the recovery uses the most recent backup copy of the database in a known consistent state.  3. The backup copy is then rolled forward to restore all subsequent transactions by using the transaction log information.  4. If the database needs to be recovered, but the committed portion of the database is usable, the recovery process uses the transaction log to \"undo\" all the transactions that were not committed.  INF3703/202 7 Note: database recovery process should be misunderstood with transaction recovery procedures. [Refer to Chapter 10, pp 646] Question 2 [26] 2.1 A fully distributed database management system must perform all of the functions of a centralized DBMS. What are the functions? [8] Ans 1. Receive the request of an application or end user. 2. Validate, analyze, and decompose the request. The request might include mathematical and logical operations such as the following: Select all customers with a balance greater than $1,000. The request might require data from only a single table, or it might require access to several tables. 3. Map the request’s logical-to-physical data components. 4. Decompose the request into several disk I/O operations. 5. Search for, locate, read, and validate the data. 6. Ensure database consistency, security, and integrity. 7. Validate the data for the conditions, if any, specified by the request. 8. Present the selected data in the required format. [Refer to Chapter 14 pp 697] 2.2 Using your own world, explain what a data fragmentation is and describe the three data fragmentation strategies. [6] Ans In a database, data fragmentation allows distributed database designer to break a single object (for example user’s database, system database or a table) into two or more segments or fragments that are stored at any site over a computer network. The three data fragmentation strategies are:  Horizontal fragmentation: Division of a relation into subsets (fragments) of tuples (rows) INF3703/202 8  Vertical fragmentation: Division of a relation into attribute (column) subsets  Mixed fragmentation: Combination of horizontal and vertical strategies (use own discretion – descriptions might be differ) [Refer to Chapter 14 pp 714 - 715] 2.3 Create an initial ER diagram for the car dealership as described (a-i) on page 612, Question 2 of your prescribed textbook. A - A sales person can sell many cars, but each car is sold by only one salesperson. B - A customer can but many cars, but each car is sold to only one customer C - A sales person writes a single invoice for each car sold D - A customer gets an invoice for each car(s) he or she buys E - A customer might come in only to have a car serviced; that is, one needs not buy a car to be classified a customer. F - When a customer takes in one or more cars for repairs or service, one service ticket is written for each car. G - The car dealership maintains a service history for each car serviced. The service records are referenced by the car's serial number. H - A car brought in for service can be worked on by many mechanics, and each mechanic can work on many cars I - A car that is serviced may or may not need parts.( For example, parts are not necessary to adjust a carburetor or to clean a fuel injector nozzle.) [10] INF3703/202 9 Ans Question 3 [20] 3.1 Briefly explain the three (3) levels of distribution transparency. [6] Ans [Marker – use own discretion – award maximum of four (4) marks] Fragmentation transparency: this is the highest level of transparency. The end user or programmer does not need to know that a database is partitioned. Therefore, neither fragment names nor fragment locations are specified prior to data access  Location transparency : it exists when the end user or programmer must specify the database fragment names, but does not need to specify where those fragments are located  Local mapping transparency : exists when the end user or programmer must specify both the fragment names and their locations  [Refer to Chapter 14 pp 704 - 705] 3.2 Elvis Velekhaya manages a small multimedia distribution [8] INF3703/202 10 company. Because the business is growing fast, Elvis recognizes that it is time to manage the vast information pool to help guide the accelerating growth. He asks you to develop a data warehouse application prototype that will enable her to study sales figures by year, region, salesperson, and product. Draw a star schema diagram for this data warehouse. Ans Use own description when awarding marks 3.3 “Big data” is one of the emerging concepts in database management systems. What do you understand by big data and what are its basic components? Note: you will need to consult external sources to answer this question. [6] Big data is a complex and large set of structured and unstructured data that are incapable of being stored and processed by current technologies and infrastructures. -It is normally divided into various components referred to as Big Data “v’s’’: The first “v” is normally attributed to Volume of data that is available from difference sources. This data continues to grow. The second “v” is velocity, referring to the rate at which data changes. The third “v” refers to the variety of the data that is collected from different sources. The fourth “v” refers to the veracity or trustworthiness of the large set of data collected from various sources. And recently others have added another “v”, which refers to the YEAR REGION AGENT PRODUCT TOTAL_VA LUE REGION AGENT YEAR PRODUCT ORDER R INF3703/202 11 “value” that Big data could create for organizations such as government, health, and others. Question 4 [24] All the questions in this section are from the prescribed textbook. You may discuss the questions with your fellow students, but each student must submit their own work. 4.1 What do you understand by the term Business Intelligence (BI)? Elaborate on your definition by also referring to the frameworks that Business Intelligence provides for organizations. [8] Ans Business intelligence (BI) is a term that describes a comprehensive, cohesive, and integrated set of tools and processes used to capture, collect, integrate, store, and analyze data with the purpose of generating and presenting information to support business decision making. BI provides a framework for: 1. Collecting and storing operational data 2. Aggregating the operational data into decision support data 3. Analyzing decision support data to generate information 4. Presenting such information to the end user to support business decisions 5. Making business decisions, which in turn generate more data that are collected, stored, and so on (restarting the process) 6. Monitoring results to evaluate outcomes of the business decisions, which again provides more data to be collected, stored, and so on 7. Predicting future behaviors and outcomes with a high degree of accuracy [Refer to Chapter 15 pp 732 - 742] 4.2 Improved decision making is the main goal of Business Intelligence, but BI provides other benefits. What are the benefits? List and explain them. [8] Ans • Integrating architecture. Like any other IT project, BI has INF3703/202 12 the potential of becoming the integrating umbrella for a disparate mix of IT systems within an organization. • Common user interface for data reporting and analysis. BI front ends can provide up-to-the-minute consolidated information using a common interface for all company users. IT departments no longer have to provide multiple training options for diverse interfaces. End users benefit from similar or common interfaces in different devices that use multiple clever and insightful presentation formats. • Common data repository fosters single version of company data. In the past, multiple IT systems supported different aspects of an organization’s operations. Such systems collected and stored data in separate data stores. • Improved organizational performance. BI can provide competitive advantages in many different areas, from customer support to manufacturing processes. 4.3 What is a data warehouse, and what are its main characteristics? [8] Ans Data warehouse is an Integrated, subject-oriented, time-variant, nonvolatile collection of data that provides support for decision making. Usually a read-only database optimized for data analysis and query processing that requires time, money, and considerable managerial effort to create. The main characteristics of data warehouse are: Integrated – the data warehouse is a centralized, consolidated database that integrates data derived from the entire organization and from multiple sources with diverse formats. Data integration implies that all business entities, data characteristics and business metrics are described in the same way throughout the enterprise. Subject-oriented – Data warehouse data are arranged and optimized to provide answers to questions coming from diverse functional areas within a company Time-variant – warehouse data represent the flow of data through time. Nonvolatile – once data enter the data warehouse, they are never removed. Because the data in the warehouse represent the INF3703/2014 5 2.

The DBLC traces the history (life cycle) of a database system. SDLC is composed of five (5) phases  (i.e. planning, analysis, detailed system design, implementation, and maintenance).  DBLC consists of (6) phases (i.e. database initial study, database design, implementation and loading, testing and evaluation, operation, and maintenance and evolution)  [Refer to Chapter 10] 1.3 You have been tasked to implement a new MySQL database in your organization. What steps would you follow to implement the logical design of this database? Note: an example on how this could be done in IBM’s DB2 is provided on page 526 of the prescribed textbook. For MySQL, the process is slightly different. [5] Ans [Marker – use own discretion, answer may differ, but concept need to remain the same, students should provide answers for logical design (NOT physical (e.g. creation of tables) or conceptual (create abstract database structure)] It is important to note that logical design is software-dependent. In order to implement a new MySQL database, the following steps could be followed: • Create the logical data model (this could be an ER diagram)  • Validate the logical data model using appropriate normalization  • Assign and validate integrity constraints in MySQL  • Merge logical models together (if needed)  • Review the logical data model with the users  [Refer to Chapter 10 pp 524 -525] 1.4 In your opinion, why is it important for the Database Administrator (DBA) to [4] INF3703/202 6 engage with end-users? Ans [Marker – use own discretion, answer may differ – award maximum of four (4) marks] It is important for the DBA to interact with the end-users so performing some of the following • Gathering user requirements  • Building end user requirements  • Resolving conflicts and problems  • Finding solutions to information needs  • Ensuring quality and integrity of applications and data  • Managing the training and support of DBMS users  [Refer to Chapter 10, pp 543-544] 1.5 Why would you consider data security during the database design phase? [2] Ans [Marker – use own discretion – award maximum of two [2] marks ] When designing a database system, it is important to consider data security so as to determine the security requirements at an early stage  and answer a number of questions, such as what data to protect and how.  Who will access  the database (usernames and passwords), what rights/constraints  are applicable for the specific tables and other components [Refer to Chapter 10 – 11] Question 2 [10] 2.1 As an expert database designer, you have been asked to create a conceptual model of the database for myPortal; a new portal for computing students at Unisa, Florida Campus. What type of information would you require and what are the likely sources of this information to create the conceptual model? Please provide relevant examples. [4] Ans [Marker – use own discretion – award maximum of one [1] mark for answering the first part of the question, one [1] mark for source of information and two [2] marks for appropriate examples] The type of information required includes transaction and information requirements for the database, such as database entities, data types, relationships, business rules, reports, queries, and attributes  for the myPortal database. Example: Student Assignment Results report, Student entity and so forth  The sources of this information could be end-user data views, existing systems (e.g. myUnisa) and system analysts  Example: MyUnisa  [Refer to Chapter 11 pp 564-565] 2.2 Demonstrate a simple conceptual model for the new portal (refer to Q2.1), using ER diagrams. Note: provide a minimum of four (4) or maximum of six (6) normalized entities. [6] Ans [Marker – The conceptual model may differ, use own discretion. Award 4 marks for relevant entities and 2 marks for attributes] INF3703/202 7  (entities)  (attributes) [Refer to Chapter 11 pp 568- 573] Question 3 [10] 3.1 Study the SQL query below and answer the question that follows: SELECT CUS_CODE, MAX(LINE_UNITS*LINE_PRICE) FROM CUSTOMER NATURAL JOIN INVOICE NATURAL JOIN LINE WHERE CUS_AREACODE = ‘615’ GROUP BY CUS_CODE; Assuming that you generate 10,000 invoices per month for different clients; what recommendation would you give the database designer about the use of derived attributes? [4] Ans [Marker – use own discretion – award maximum of four (4) marks] This query uses the MAX aggregate function to compute the maximum invoice line value by customer. Because this table increases at a rate of 10,000 rows per month, the query would take considerable amount of time to run as the number of invoice rows increases. Furthermore, because the MAX aggregate function uses an expression (LINE_UNITS*LINE_PRICE) instead of a simple table column, the query optimizer is very likely to perform a full table scan in order to compute the maximum invoice line value. One way to speed up the query would be to store the derived attribute LINE_TOTAL in the LINE_TABLE and create an index on LINE_TOTAL. This way, the query would benefit by using the index to execute the query. INF3703/202 8 [Refer to Chapter 12] 3.2 Figure 1: XYZee Trading Relational Diagram Using this database structure, write the SQL code to represent the following transaction. Use BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT to group the SQL statements in logical transactions.

You may discuss the questions with your fellow students, but each student must submit their own work. 4.1 Page 728, Question 1 (Only f and h) – At Site A [2] Ans [Marker –award marks as indicated] The SQL statement was as follows: INF3703/202 9 SELECT CUS_NUM, CUS_NAME, INV_TOTAL FROM CUSTOMER, INVOICE WHERE CUSTOMER.CUS_NUM = INVOICE.CUS_NUM; f. This SQL sequence represents a distributed request. The request accesses two DP sites, one local and one remote. Therefore distributed capability is needed. SELECT * FROM PRODUCT WHERE PROD_QOH < 10; h. This SQL sequence represents a distributed request. In this case, the PRODUCT table is partitioned between two DP sites, A and B. Although the request accesses only one remote DP site, it accesses a table that is partitioned into two fragments: PROD-A and PROD-B. A single request can access a partitioned table only if the DBMS supports distributed request [Refer to Chapter 14] 4.2 Page 730, Question 3 (Only a, b, c, d) Given the scenario and the requirements in Question 2 (page 730), answer the following questions: [8] Ans [Marker – use own discretion for theoretical questions – award marks as indicated] 4. What recommendations will you make regarding the type and characteristics of the required database system? The Magazine Publishing Company requires a distributed system with distributed database capabilities. ( ½ ) The distributed system will be distributed among the company locations in France, Italy, The Netherlands, and United Kingdom. The DDBMS must be able to support distributed transparency ( ½ ) features, such as fragmentation transparency, replica transparency, transaction transparency, and performance transparency. b. What type of data fragmentation is needed for each table? The database must be horizontally partitioned, ( ½ ) using the CUS_REGION attribute for the CUSTOMER table and the INV_REGION attribute for the INVOICE table( ½ ) c.

Atomic Transaction Property A property that required all parts of a transaction to be treated as a single, logical unit of work in which all operations must be completed(committed) to produce a consistent database. Binary Lock A lock that has only two states: locked(1) and unlocked(0). If a data item is locked by a transaction, no other transaction can use that data item. Buffer Temporary storage area in primary memory used to speed up disk operations. Checkpoint In transaction management, an operation in which the database management system writes all of its updated buffers to disk. Concurrency Control A DBMS feature that coordinates the simultaneous execution of transaction in a multiprocessing database system while preserving data integrity. Consistency A database condition in which all data integrity constraints are satisfied, To ensure consistency of a database, every transaction must begin with the database in a known consistent state. If not, the transaction will yield an inconsistent database that violate its integrity and business rules. Consistent Database State A database state in which all data integrity constraints are satisfied. Database-Level Lock A type of lock that restricts database access to the owner of the lock and allows only one user at a time to access the database, This lock works for batch processes but is unsuitable for online multiuser DMBSs. Database Recovery The process of restoring a database to a previous consistent state. Database Request The equivalent of a single SQL statement in an application program or a transaction. Deadlock A condition in which two or more transactions wait indefinitely for the other to release the lock on a previously locked data item. Also called deadly embrace. Deadly Embrace See deadlock. Deferred Update In transaction management, a condition in which transaction operations do not immediately update a physical database. Also called deferred write technique. Deferred-Write Technique See Deferred Update. Dirty Read In transaction management, when a transaction reads data that is not yet committed. Diskpage A permanent storage, the equivalent of a desk block, which can be described as a directly addressable section of a desk. A diskpage has fixed size, such as 4K, 8K, or 16K. Durability The transaction property that ensures that once transaction changes are done and committed, they cannot be undone or lost, even in the event of system failure. Exclusive Lock An exclusive lock is issued when a transaction requests permission to update a data item and no locks are held on that data item by any other transaction, An exclusive lock does not allow other transactions to access the database. Field-Level Lock A lock that allows the concurrent transactions to access the same row as long as they require the use of different fields (attributes) within that tow. This type of lock yields the most flexible multiuser data access but requires a high level of computer overhead. Immediate Update See Write-Through Technique. Inconsistent Retrieval A concurrency control problem that arises when a transaction-calculating summary (aggregate) functions are updating the data, yielding erroneous results. Isolation A database transaction property in which a data item used by one transaction is not available to other transaction until the first on ends. Lock A device that guarantees unique use of a data item in a particular transaction operation, A transaction requires a lock prior to data access; the lock is released after the operation's execution to enable other transaction to lock the data item for their own use. Lock Granularity The level of lock use. Locking can take place at the following levels: database, table, page, rows, and field (attribute). Lock Manager A DBMS component that is responsible for assigning and releasing locks. Lost Update A concurrency control problem in which a data update is lost during the concurrent execution of transactions. Monotonicity A quality that ensures that time stamp values always increase. (The time stamping approach to scheduling concurrent transactions assigns a global, unique time stamp to each transaction. The time stamp value produces an explicit order in which transaction are submitted to the DMBS.) Mutual Exclusive Rule A condition in which only one transaction at a time can own an exclusive lock on the same object. Nonrepeatable Read In transaction management, when a transaction reads a given row at time t1, then reads the same row at time t2, yielding different results because the original row may have been updated or deleted. Optimistic Approach In transaction management, a concurrency control technique based on the assumption that most database operations do not conflict. Page In permanent storage, the equivalent of a desk block, which can be described as a directly addressable section of a disk, A diskpage has a fixed size, such as 4K, 8K, or 16K. Page-Level Lock In this type of lock, the database management system locks an entire diskpage, or section of a disk. A diskpage can contain data for one or more rows, and from one or more tables. Pessimistic Locking The use of locks based on the assumption that conflict between transactions is likely. Phantom Read In transaction management, when a transaction executes a query at time t1, then runs the same query at t2, yielding additional rows that satisfy the query. Read Committed An ANSI SQL transaction isolation level that allows transaction to read only committed data. This is the default mode of operations for most databases. Read Uncommitted An ANSI SQL transaction isolation level that allows transaction to read uncommitted data from other transactions, and which allows non repeatable reads and phantom reads. The least restrictive level defined by ANSI SQL. Redundant Transaction Log Multiple copies of the transaction log kept by database management systems to ensure that the physical failure of a desk will not impair the DBMS's ability to recover data. Repeatable Read An ANSI SQL transaction isolation level that uses shared locks to ensure that other transactions do not update a row after the original query updates it. However, phantom reads are allowed. Row-Level lock A less restrictive database lock in which the DBMS allows concurrent transactions to access different rows of the same table, even when the rows are on the same page. Scheduler The DBMS component that establishes the order in which concurrent transaction operations are executed. The scheduler interleaves the execution of database operations in a specific sequence to ensure serializability. Serializability A property in which the selected order of concurrent transaction operations creates the same final database state that would have been produced if the transaction had been executed in a serial fashion. Serializable An ANSI SQL transaction isolation level that does not allow dirty reads, non repeatable reads, or phantom reads; the most restrictive level defined by the ANSI SQL standard. Serializable Schedule In transaction management, a schedule of operations in which the interleaved execution of the transactions yields the same result as if they were executed in serial order. Shared Lock A lock that is issued when a transaction requests permission to read data from the database an no exclusive locks are held on the data by another transaction. A shared lock allows other read-only transaction to access the database. Table-Level Lock A locking scheme that allows only one transaction at a time to access a table. A table-level lock locks an entire table, preventing access to any row by transaction T2 while T1 is using the table. Time Stamping In transaction management, a technique used in scheduling concurrent transaction that assigns a global unique time stamp to each transaction. Transaction A sequence of database requests that accesses the database. A transaction is a logical unit of work; that is, it must be entirely completed or aborted - no intermediate ending states are accepted. All transactions must have the properties of atomicity, consistent, isolation, and durability. Transaction Log A feature used by the DBMS to keep track of all transaction operation that update the database. The information stored in this log is used by the DBMS for recovery purposes. Two-Phase Locking (2PL) A set of rules that governs how transactions acquire and relinquish locks. Two-phase locking guarantees serializability, but it does not prevent deadlocks. The two-phase locking protocol is divided into to phases: (1) A growing phase occurs when the transaction acquires the locks it needs without unlocking any existing data locks. Once all locks have been acquired, the transaction is in its locked point. (2) A shrinking phase occurs when the transaction releases all locks and cannot obtain a new lock. Uncommitted Data A concurrency control problem in which a transaction accesses uncommitted data from another transaction. Uniqueness In concurrency control, a property of time stamping that ensures no equal time stamp values can exist. Wait/Die A concurrency control scheme in which an older transaction must wait for the younger transaction to complete and release the locks before requesting the lock itself. Otherwise, the newer transaction dies and is rescheduled. Wound/Wait A concurrency control scheme in which an older transaction can request the lock, preempt the younger transaction, and reschedule it. Otherwise, the newer transaction waits until the older transaction finishes. Write-Ahead-Log Protocol In concurrency control, a process that ensures transaction logs are written to permanent storage before any database data is actually updated. Write Through Technique In concurrency control, a process that ensures a database is immediately updated by operations during the transaction's execution, even before the transaction reaches its commit point. Also called immediate update. Chapter 11: Access Plan A set of instructions generated at application complication time that is created and managed by DMBS. The access plan predetermines how an application's query will access the database at run time. Automatic Query Optimization A method by which a DMBS find the most efficient access path for the execution of a query. Bitmap Index An index that uses a bit array (0's and 1's) to represent the existence of a value or condition. B-tree Index An ordered data structure organized as an upside-down tree. Buffer Cache See Data Cache. Data Files A named physical storage space that stores a database's data. It can reside in different directory on a hard disk or on one or more hard disks. All data in a database is stored in data files. A typical enterprise database is normally composed of several data files. A data file can contain rows from one or more tables. Data Sparsity A column distribution of values or the number of different values column can have. DBMS Performance Tuning A set of activities and procedures designed to reduce the response time of a database system - that is to ensure that an end-user query is processed by the DBMS in the minimum amount of time Dynamic Query Optimization The process of determining the SQL access strategy at run time, using the most up- to-date information about the database.

Index Selectivity A measure of how likely an index is to be used in query processing. Input/Output (I/O) Request A low-level data access operation that reads or writes data to and from computer devices. I/O Accelerator A device used to improve throughput for input/output operations. Manual Query Optimization An operation mode that requires the end user or programmer to define the access path for the execution of a query. Manual Statistical Generation Mode A mode of generating statistical data access information for query optimization In this mode, the DBA must periodically run a routine to generate the data access statistics - for example, running the RUNSTAT command in an IBM DB@ database. Optimizer Hints Special instructions for the query optimizer that are embedded inside the SSQL command text. Procedure Cache See SQL cache. Query Optimizer A DBMS process that analyzes SQL queries and finds the most efficient way to access the data. The query optimizer generates the access or execution plan for the query. Query Processing Bottleneck In query optimization, a delay introduced in the processing of an I/O operation that causes the overall system to slow down, RAID An acronym for Redundant Array of Independent Desks. RAID systems use multiple disks to create virtual disks (storage volumes) from several individual disks. RAID systems provide performance improvement, fault tolerance, and a balance between the two. Rule-Based Optimizer A query optimization mode based on the rule-based query optimization algorithm. Rule-Based Query Optimization Algorithm A query optimization technique that uses preset rules and points to determine the best approach to executing a query. Static Query Optimization A query optimization mode in which the access path to a database is predetermined at compilation time. Statistically Based Query Optimization Algorithm A query optimization technique that uses statistical information about a database. The DBMS then uses the statistics to determine the best access strategy. SQL Cache A shared, reserved memory area that stores the most recently executed SQL statements or PL/SQL procedures, including triggers and functions. Also called procedure cache. SQL Perfomance Tuning Activities to help generate a SQL query that returns the correct answer in the least amount of time, using the minimum amount of resources at the server end.
