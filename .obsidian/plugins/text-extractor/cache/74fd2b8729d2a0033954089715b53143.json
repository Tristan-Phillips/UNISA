Views of AI fall into four categories: The textbook advocates \"acting rationally\" Thought Processes Like Humans Rational Thought Processes Act Like Humans Act Rationally Thinking humanly: cognitive modeling • Cognitive Science – must figure out how human’s think – [introspection – experimental investigation] – Requires scientific theories of internal activities of the brain – Express these theories as computer programs • How to validate? Requires 1. Predicting and testing behavior of human subjects (top-down) 2. Direct identification from neurological data (bottom- up) Acting humanly: Turing Test • Turing (1950) \"Computing machinery and intelligence\": • Operational test for intelligent behavior: the Imitation Game • Interrogator asks questions of two “people” who are out of sight • 30 minutes to ask whatever he or she wants • Task: to determine only through the questions and answers which is which • Computer deemed intelligent if interrogator can’t distinguish between person and computer. Artificial intelligence is the enterprise of constructing an artificat that can pass the Turing text Acting humanly: Turing Test (cont) • What major components were important – Natural language processing – Knowledge representation – Automated reasoning – Machine learning • What additional for total Turing Test – Computer vision – Robotics • Note: looking at I/O behavior only 2 Thinking rationally: \"laws of thought\" • Aristotle: what are correct arguments/thought processes? • Several Greek schools developed various forms of logic: notation and rules of derivation for thoughts; may or may not have proceeded to the idea of mechanization • Direct line through mathematics and philosophy to modern AI • Problems: 1. Not all intelligent behavior is mediated by logical deliberation 2. Some knowledge is very hard to encode – informal, uncertain 3. In practice, computationally intractable Acting rationally: rational agent • Correct thinking is good but: – Sometimes you must do something and there is no provably correct thing to do – Sometimes you must react quicker without time for reasoning • Rational behavior: doing the right thing • The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information • Doesn't necessarily involve thinking – e.g., bli ki fl bhi ki h ld b i Acting rationally: rational agent (cont) • Rational behavior: doing the right thing • The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information • Doesn't necessarily involve thinking – e.g., blinking reflex – but thinking should be in the service of rational action • This is the view taken by the book Rational agents •An agent is an entity that perceives and acts • This course is about designing rational agents • Abstractly, an agent is a function from percept histories to actions: [f: P*  A] For any given class of environments and tasks, we seek the agent (or class of agents) with the best performance • Caveat: computational limitations make perfect rationality unachievable  design best program for given machine resources AI prehistory • Philosophy Logic, methods of reasoning, mind as physical system foundations of learning, language, rationality • Mathematics Formal representation and proof algorithms, computation, (un)decidability, (in)tractability, probability • Economics utility, decision theory • Neuroscience physical substrate for mental activity • Psychology phenomena of perception and motor control, experimental techniques • Computer building fast computers engineering • Control theory design systems that maximize an objective function over time • Linguistics knowledge representation, grammar Abridged history of AI • 1943 McCulloch & Pitts: Boolean circuit model of brain • 1950 Turing's \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" • 1956 Dartmouth meeting: \"Artificial Intelligence\" adopted • 1952—69 Look, Ma, no hands! • 1950s Early AI programs, including Samuel's checkers program, Newell & Simon's Logic Theorist, Gelernter's Geometry Engine • 1965 Robinson's complete algorithm for logical reasoning • 1966—73 AI discovers computational complexity Neural network research almost disappears • 1969—79 Early development of knowledge-based systems • 1980-- AI becomes an industry • 1986-- Neural networks return to popularity • 1987-- AI becomes a science • 1995-- The emergence of intelligent agents 3 State of the art • Deep Blue defeated the reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 • Proved a mathematical conjecture (Robbins conjecture) unsolved for decades • No hands across America (driving autonomously 98% of the time from Pittsburgh to San Diego) • During the 1991 Gulf War, US forces deployed an AI logistics planning and scheduling program that involved up to 50,000 vehicles, cargo, and people • NASA's on-board autonomous planning program controlled the scheduling of operations for a spacecraft • Proverb solves crossword puzzles better than most humans","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
