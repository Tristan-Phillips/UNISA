{"path":"Subjects/INF3720 - Human-Computer Interaction II/Unsorted/Slides/chapter_09_5e.pdf","text":"Chapter 9 Data Analysis, Interpretation and Presentation Aims • Discuss the difference between qualitative and quantitative data and analysis. • Enable you to analyze data gathered from: – Questionnaires. – Interviews. – Observation studies. • Make you aware of software packages that are available to help your analysis. • Identify common pitfalls in data analysis, interpretation, and presentation. • Enable you to interpret and present your findings in appropriate ways. www.id-book.com 2 Quantitative and qualitative • Quantitative data – expressed as numbers • Qualitative data – difficult to measure sensibly as numbers, e.g. count number of words to measure dissatisfaction • Quantitative analysis – numerical methods to ascertain size, magnitude, amount • Qualitative analysis – expresses the nature of elements and is represented as themes, patterns, stories • Be careful how you manipulate data and numbers! www.id-book.com 3 Basic quantitative analysis • Averages – Mean: add up values and divide by number of data points – Median: middle value of data when ranked – Mode: figure that appears most often in the data • Percentages • Be careful not to mislead with numbers! • Graphical representations give overview of data www.id-book.com Number of errors made 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 UserNumber of errors made Number of errors made 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 5 10 15 20 UserNumber of errors made 4 How question design affects data analysis • Question design affects analysis – Open question: each answer analysed separately – Closed question: analysed quantitatively • Fixed alternative answers restrict what can be said in findings www.id-book.com 4 Basic qualitative analysis • Looking for critical incidents – Helps to focus in on key events – Then analysis can proceed using specific techniques • Identifying themes – Emergent from data, dependent on observation framework if used – Inductive analysis • Categorizing data – Categorization scheme pre-specified – Deductive analysis • In practice, combination of inductive and deductive www.id-book.com 6 Which analytical framework? www.id-book.com 7 Conversation Analysis • Examines the semantics of a conversation in fine detail www.id-book.com 8 An extract of the conversation between a family and Alexa Discourse Analysis • Focuses on dialogue, i.e. the meaning of what is said and how words convey meaning • Assumption that there is no objective scientific “truth” • Language is viewed as a constructive tool • Discourse analysis is useful when trying to identify subtle meaning www.id-book.com 9 Content Analysis • Involves classifying data into themes or categories, and studying their frequencies • Can be used for any “text”: video, newspapers, advertisements, images, sounds • Often used in conjunction with other techniques www.id-book.com 10 Interaction Analysis • A way to investigate and understand interactions between people, and people and artefacts • Based on empirical observations such as videos • Inductive process in teams, collaboratively • Contents of the material is logged • Materials are extracted, classified or removed • Instances of a salient event are assembled and played one after the other • The team of researchers studies the assemblage together www.id-book.com 11 Grounded Theory • Aims to develop theory from systematic analysis of empirical data • Three levels of ‘coding’ – Open: identify categories – Axial: flesh out and link to subcategories – Selective: form theoretical scheme • Researchers are encouraged to draw on own theoretical backgrounds to inform analysis • Analytic tools to help stimulate: ⎻ Question the data ⎻ Analyse words, phrases or sentence ⎻ Comparisons between objects or abstract categories www.id-book.com 12 Illustration of open coding www.id-book.com 13 Development of open coding www.id-book.com 14 Source: Alharti et al (2018) System-based frameworks • Understanding a whole socio- technical system requires different analytical framework ⎻ Socio-technical systems theory ⎻ Distributed Cognition of Teamwork www.id-book.com 15 Tools to support data analysis www.id-book.com 16 • Spreadsheet – simple to use, basic graphs • Statistical packages, e.g. SAS and SPSS • Qualitative data analysis tools – Categorization and theme-based analysis – Quantitative analysis of text-based data • Nvivo and Dedoose support qualitative data analysis • CAQDAS Networking Project, based at the University of Surrey (http://caqdas.soc.surrey.ac.uk/) Interpreting and presenting the findings www.id-book.com 17 Interpreting and presenting the findings www.id-book.com 18 Presenting findings • Structured notations have clear syntax and semantics to present particular viewpoint • Stories are easy and intuitive approach to communicate ideas • Summarise findings using a range of notations www.id-book.com 19 Summary • The data analysis that can be done depends on the data gathering that was done • Qualitative and quantitative data may be gathered from any of the three main data gathering approaches • Percentages and averages are commonly used in Interaction Design • Mean, median and mode are different kinds of ‘average’ and can have very different answers for the same set of data • Analysis of qualitative data analysis may be inductive (extracted from the data), or deductive (pre-existing concepts) • Several analytical frameworks exist that focus on different levels of granularity with different purposes www.id-book.com 19","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
