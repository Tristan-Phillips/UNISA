If you cannot make it, the same exam will be repeated tonight from 20h00 to 21h00. You will find the online assessment tab on the left- hand side of the screen from where you also access the Lessons etc. Please have paper and a pen with you, as you will have to write down sets, do calculations etc. Before you start, please look at the previous announcement for things to look out for on the system, things that do not work etc, so that you can email me with feedback - positive and negative. & v Reply","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
