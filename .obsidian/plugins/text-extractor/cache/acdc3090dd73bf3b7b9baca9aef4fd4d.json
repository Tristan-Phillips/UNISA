Bad designs Elevator controls and labels on the bottom row all look the same, so it is easy to push a label by mistake instead of a control button People do not make same mistake for the labels and buttons on the top row. Why not? www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com Why is this vending machine so bad? • Need to push button first to activate reader • Normally insert bill first before making selection • Contravenes well known convention www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com Good design • Marble answering machine (Bishop, 1995) • Based on how everyday objects behave • Easy, intuitive and a pleasure to use • Only requires one-step actions to perform core tasks www.id-book.com Good and bad design • Why is the TiVo remote much better designed than standard remote controls? • Peanut shaped to fit in hand • Logical layout and color-coded, distinctive buttons • Easy to locate buttons www.id-book.com Dilemma Which is the best way to interact with a smart TV? Why? • Pecking using a grid keyboard via a remote control • Swiping across 2 alphanumeric rows using a touchpad on remote control • Voice control using remote or smart speaker www.id-book.com What to design • Need to take into account: • Who the users are • What activities are being carried out • Where the interaction is taking place • Need to optimize the interactions users have with a product: • So that they match the users’ activities and needs www.id-book.com What is interaction design? “Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.” Sharp, Rogers and Preece (2019) “The design of spaces for human communication and interaction.” Winograd (1997) www.id-book.com Goals of interaction design • Develop usable products • Usability means easy to learn, effective to use and provide an enjoyable experience • Involve users in the design process www.id-book.com Which kind of design? • Number of other terms used emphasizing what is being designed, e.g. • user interface design, software design, user-centered design, product design, web design, experience design (UX) • Interaction design is the umbrella term covering all of these aspects • fundamental to all disciplines, fields, and approaches concerned with researching and designing computer- based systems for people www.id-book.com Interaction design www.id-book.com 12 Relationship between ID, HCI and other fields Academic disciplines contributing to ID: • Psychology • Social Sciences • Computing Sciences • Engineering • Ergonomics • Informatics www.id-book.com Relationship between ID, HCI and other fields Design practices contributing to ID: • Graphic design • Product design • Artist-design • Industrial design • Film industry www.id-book.com Relationship between ID, HCI and other fields Interdisciplinary fields that ‘do’ interaction design: • HCI • Ubiquitous Computing • Human Factors • Cognitive Engineering • Cognitive Ergonomics • Computer Supported Co-operative Work • Information Systems www.id-book.com Working in multidisciplinary teams • Many people from different backgrounds involved • Different perspectives and ways of seeing and talking about things • Benefits • more ideas and designs generated • Disadvantages • difficult to communicate and progress forward the designs being create www.id-book.com 16 Interaction design in business • Large number of ID consultancies, examples of well known ones include: • Nielsen Norman Group: “help companies enter the age of the consumer, designing human-centered products and services” • Cooper: “From research and product to goal-related design” • IDEO: “creates products, services and environments for companies pioneering new ways to provide value to their customers” www.id-book.com The User Experience • How a product behaves and is used by people in the real world • the way people feel about it and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, holding it, and opening or closing it • “every product that is used by someone has a user experience: newspapers, ketchup bottles, reclining armchairs, cardigan sweaters.” (Garrett, 2010) • “all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products. (Nielsen and Norman, 2014) • Cannot design a user experience, only design for a user experience www.id-book.com Defining User Experience • how users perceive a product, such as whether a smartwatch is seen as sleek or chunky, and their emotional reaction to it, such as whether people have a positive experience when using it. (Hornbæk and Hertzum, 2017) • Hassenzahl’s (2010) model of the user experience • pragmatic - how simple, practical, and obvious it is for the user to achieve their goals • hedonic - how evocative and stimulating the interaction is to users www.id-book.com Why was the iPod user experience such a success? • Quality user experience from the start • Simple, elegant, distinct brand, pleasurable, must have fashion item, catchy names, cool, etc. www.id-book.com Core characteristics of interaction design • Users should be involved through the development of the project • Specific usability and user experience goals need to be identified, clearly documented and agreed at the beginning of the project • Iteration is needed through the core activities www.id-book.com Why? • Help designers: • understand how to design interactive products that fit with what people want, need and may desire • appreciate that one size does not fit all e.g., teenagers are very different to grown-ups • identify any incorrect assumptions they may have about particular user groups e.g., not all old people want or need big fonts • be aware of both people’s sensitivities and their capabilities www.id-book.com Accessibility and Inclusiveness • Accessibility – the extent to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible • focus is on people with disabilities, e.g. Android OS, Apple VoiceOver • Inclusiveness –making products and services accommodate the widest possible number of people • e.g. smartphones designed for all and made available to everyone regardless of their disability, education, age, or income www.id-book.com Disabilities • Whether someone is disabled changes over time with age, or recovery from an accident • The severity and impact of an impairment can vary over the course of a day or in different environmental conditions • Disabilities can result because technologies are designed to necessitate a certain type of interaction that is impossible for someone with an impairment www.id-book.com Understanding Disability • Disabilities can be classified as: • Sensory impairment (such as loss of vision or hearing) • Physical impairment (having loss of functions to one or more parts of the body after a stroke or spinal cord injury) • Cognitive (e.g. learning impairment or loss of memory/cognitive function due to old age) • Each type can be further defined in terms of capability • e.g. someone might have only peripheral vision, be color blind, or have no light perception • Impairment can be categorized: • permanent (e.g., long-term wheelchair user) • temporary (e.g. after an accident or illness) • situational (e.g. a noisy environment means a person can’t hear) www.id-book.com Being Cool About Disability • Prosthetics can be designed to move beyond being functional (and often ugly) to being desirable and fashionable • People now refer to “wearing their wheels,” rather than “using a wheelchair” www.id-book.com Fashionable leg cover designed by Alleles Design Studio Cultural Differences • 5/21/2015 versus 21/5/2015? • Which should be used for international services and online forms? • Why is it that certain products, like smartphones, universally accepted by people from all parts of the world whereas websites are reacted to differently by people from different cultures? www.id-book.com Usability Goals • Effective to use • Efficient to use • Safe to use • Have good utility • Easy to learn • Easy to remember how to use www.id-book.com User Experience Goals Desirable aspects Satisfying Helpful Fun Enjoyable Motivating Provocative Engaging Challenging Surprising Pleasurable Enhancing sociability Rewarding Exciting Supporting creativity Emotionally fulfilling Entertaining Cognitively stimulating Experiencing flow Undesirable aspects Boring Unpleasant Frustrating Patronizing Making one feel guilty Making one feel stupid Annoying Cutesy Childish Gimmicky www.id-book.com Usability and User experience goals • Selecting terms to convey a person’s feelings, emotions, etc., can help designers understand the multifaceted nature of the user experience • How do usability goals differ from user experience goals? • Are there trade-offs between the two kinds of goals? • e.g. can a product be both fun and safe? • How easy is it to measure usability versus user experience goals? www.id-book.com Design Principles • Generalizable abstractions for thinking about different aspects of design • The do’s and don'ts of interaction design • What to provide and what not to provide at the interface • Derived from a mix of theory-based knowledge, experience and common-sense www.id-book.com Visibility • This is a control panel for an elevator • How does it work? • Push a button for the floor you want? • Nothing happens. Push any other button? Still nothing. What do you need to do? • It is not visible as to what to do! www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com Visibility …you need to insert your room card in the slot by the buttons to get the elevator to work! How would you make this action more visible? • make the card reader more obvious • provide an auditory message, that says what to do (which language?) • provide a big label next to the card reader that flashes when someone enters • make relevant parts visible • make what has to be done obvious www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com What do I do if I am wearing black? Invisible automatic controls can make it more difficult to use www.id-book.com Feedback • Sending information back to the user about what has been done • Includes sound, highlighting, animation and combinations of these • e.g. when screen button clicked on provides sound or red highlight feedback: www.id-book.com “ccclichhk” Constraints • Restricting the possible actions that can be performed • Helps prevent user from selecting incorrect options • Physical objects can be designed to constrain things • e.g. only one way you can insert a key into a lock www.id-book.com Logical or ambiguous design? • Where do you plug the mouse? • Where do you plug the keyboard? • top or bottom connector? • Do the color coded icons help? www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com How to design them more logically (i) A provides direct adjacent mapping between icon and connector (ii) B provides color coding to associate the connectors with the labels www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com www.baddesigns.com Consistency • Design interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for similar tasks • For example: • always use ctrl key plus first initial of the command for an operation – ctrl+C, ctrl+S, ctrl+O • Main benefit is consistent interfaces are easier to learn and use www.id-book.com 39 When consistency breaks down • What happens if there is more than one command starting with the same letter? • e.g. save, spelling, select, style • Have to find other initials or combinations of keys, thereby breaking the consistency rule • e.g. ctrl+S, ctrl+Sp, ctrl+shift+L • Increases learning burden on user, making them more prone to errors www.id-book.com Internal and external consistency • Internal consistency refers to designing operations to behave the same within an application • Difficult to achieve with complex interfaces • External consistency refers to designing operations, interfaces, etc., to be the same across applications and devices • Very rarely the case, based on different designer’s preference www.id-book.com 41 Keypad numbers layout A case of external inconsistency www.id-book.com 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 (a) phones, remote controls (b) calculators, computer keypads Affordances: to give a clue • Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it • e.g. a mouse button invites pushing, a door handle affords pulling • Norman (1988) used the term to discuss the design of everyday objects • Since has been much popularised in interaction design to discuss how to design interface objects • e.g. scrollbars to afford moving up and down, icons to afford clicking on www.id-book.com What does ‘affordance’ have to offer interaction design? • Interfaces are virtual and do not have affordances like physical objects • Norman argues it does not make sense to talk about interfaces in terms of ‘real’ affordances • Instead interfaces are better conceptualized as ‘perceived’ affordances • learned conventions of arbitrary mappings between action and effect at the interface • some mappings are better than others www.id-book.com 44 Activity Virtual affordances • How do the following screen objects afford? • What if you were a novice user? • Would you know what to do with them? www.id-book.com Key points • Interaction design is concerned with designing interactive products to support how people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives • It is concerned with how to create quality user experiences for services, devices and interactive products • It is multidisciplinary, involving many inputs from wide-reaching disciplines and fields • Optimizing the interaction between users and interactive products requires consideration of a number of interdependent factors, including context of use, types of activity, UX goals, accessibility, cultural differences, and user groups. • Design principles, such as feedback and simplicity, are useful heuristics for informing, analyzing, and evaluating aspects of an interactive product. www.id-book.com Chapter 2 THE PROCESS OF INTERACTION DESIGN Overview • What is involved in Interaction Design?

• It is a process: – Focused on discovering requirements, designing to fulfil requirements, producing prototypes and evaluating them – Focused on users and their goals – Involves trade-offs to balance conflicting requirements • Generating alternatives and choosing between them is key • Four approaches: user-centered design, activity- centered design, systems design, and genius design www.id-book.com 3 The double diamond of design www.id-book.com 4 Source: Adapted from https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process- what-double-diamond www.id-book.com Understanding the problem space • Explore: – What is currently the user experience – Why is a change needed – How will this change improve the situation • Articulating the problem space – Team effort – Explore different perspectives – Avoid incorrect assumptions and unsupported claims 5www.id-book.com Importance of involving users • Expectation management – Realistic expectations – No surprises, no disappointments – Timely training – Communication, but no hype • Ownership – Make the users active stakeholders – More likely to forgive or accept problems – Can make a big difference to acceptance and success of product 6www.id-book.com Degrees of user involvement • Member of the design team – Full time: constant input, but lose touch with users – Part time: patchy input, and very stressful – Short term: inconsistent across project life – Long term: consistent, but lose touch with users • Face-to-face group individual or activities • Online contributions from thousands of users – Online Feedback Exchange (OFE) systems – Crowdsourcing design ideas – Citizen science • User involvement after product release 7www.id-book.com What is a user-centered approach? User-centered approach is based on: – Early focus on users and tasks: directly studying cognitive, behavioral, anthropomorphic & attitudinal characteristics – Empirical measurement: users’ reactions and performance to scenarios, manuals, simulations & prototypes are observed, recorded and analysed – Iterative design: when problems are found in user testing, fix them and carry out more tests 8www.id-book.com Four basic activities of Interaction Design 1. Discovering requirements 2. Designing alternatives 3. Prototyping alternative designs 4. Evaluating product and its user experience throughout 9www.id-book.com A simple interaction design lifecycle model Exemplifies a user-centered design approach 10www.id-book.com Another lifecycle model: Google Design Sprints (Knapp et al, 2016) 11 Source: www.agilemarketing.net/google-design-sprints/ Used courtesy of Agile Marketing www.id-book.com Another lifecycle model: Research in the Wild (Rogers and Marshall, 2017) 12 A framework for research in the wild studies Source: Rogers and Marshall, 2017, p6. Used courtesy of Morgan & Claypool www.id-book.com Some practical issues • Who are the users? • What are the users’ needs? • How to generate alternative designs • How to choose among alternatives • How to integrate interaction design activities with other lifecycle models 13www.id-book.com Who are the users/stakeholders? • Not obvious: – 382 distinct types of users for smartphone apps (Sha Zhao et al, 2016) – Many products are intended for use by large sections of the population, so user is “everybody” – More targeted products are associated with specific roles • Stakeholders – Larger than the group of direct users – Identifying stakeholders helps identify groups to include in interaction design activities 14 • Users rarely know what is possible • Instead: – Explore the problem space – Investigate who are the users – Investigate user activities to see what can be improved – Try out ideas with potential users • Focus on peoples’ goals, usability and user experience goals rather than expect stakeholders to articulate requirements 15www.id-book.com What are the users’ needs?How to generate alternatives • Humans tend to stick with something that works • Considering alternatives helps identify better designs • Where do alternative designs come from? – ‘Flair and creativity’: research and synthesis – Cross-fertilisation of ideas from different perspectives – Users can generate different designs – Product evolution based on changing use – Seek inspiration: similar products and domain, or different products and domain • Balancing constraints and trade-offs 16www.id-book.com How to choose among alternatives • Interaction design focuses on externally visible and measurable behaviour • Technical feasibility • Evaluation with users or with peers – Prototypes not static documentation because behaviour is key • A/B Testing – Online method to inform choice between alternatives – Nontrivial to set appropriate metrics and choose user group sets • Quality thresholds: – Different stakeholder groups have different quality thresholds – Usability and user experience goals lead to relevant criteria 17www.id-book.com How to integrate interaction design activities within other models • Integrating interaction design activities in lifecycle models from other disciplines needs careful planning • Software development lifecycle models are prominent • Integrating with agile software development is promising because – it incorporates tight iterations – it champions early and regular feedback – it handles emergent requirements – it aims to strike a balance between flexibility and structure 18www.id-book.com Some key points • Four basic activities in interaction design process – Discovering requirements – Designing alternatives – Prototyping – Evaluating • User-centered design rests on three principles – Early focus on users and tasks – Empirical measurement using quantifiable & measurable usability criteria – Iterative design 19www.id-book.com Chapter 3 CONCEPTUALIZING INTERACTION DESIGN? Conceptualizing design • Proof of concept – conceptualize what the proposed product will do • Why the need to conceptualizing design? • to scrutinize vague ideas and assumptions about the benefits of the proposed product in terms of their feasibility • how realistic is it to develop? • how desirable and useful? www.id-book.com Assumptions and claims • Write down your assumptions and claims when coming up with a new design • Try to defend and support them by what they will provide • Those that are difficult to articulate – can highlight what ideas are vague or unrealistic – identify human activities and interactivities that are problematic • Iteratively work out how the design ideas might be improved www.id-book.com What is an assumption? • Taking something for granted when it needs further investigation – e.g. people will want to watch TV while driving http://www.ibiblio.org/jlillie/cooltown/lillie.htm www.id-book.com What is a claim? • Stating something to be true when it is still open to question – e.g. “a multimodal style of interaction for controlling GPS — one that involves speaking while driving — is safe” www.id-book.com Activity: How will enabling robot waiters to speak to customers enhance their experience? www.id-book.com Source: Xinhua/Guo Cheng, www.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-12/23/c_134945262.htm What is the problem being addressed? • The benefits: – the robot could take orders and entertain customers by having a conversation with them – could make recommendations for different customers, such as restless children or fussy eaters • But just assumptions • The real problem being addressed: “It is difficult to recruit good wait staff who provide the level of customer service to which we have become accustomed.” www.id-book.com Working through assumptions • Many unknowns need to be considered in the initial stages of a design project – where do your ideas come from? – What sources of inspiration were used? – Is there any theory or research that can be used to inform them? • During the early ideation process – ask questions, reconsider assumptions, and articulate concerns www.id-book.com A framework for analysing the problem space • Are there problems with an existing product or user experience? If so, what are they? • Why do you think there are problems? • How do you think your proposed design ideas might overcome these? • If you are designing for a new user experience how do you think your proposed design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of doing things? www.id-book.com Activity • What were the assumptions and claims made about watching 3D TV? www.id-book.com Figure 3.2 A family watching 3D TV Source: Andrey Popov/Shutterstock.com Assumptions and claims: how realistic? • There was no existing problem to overcome – what was being proposed was a new way of experiencing TV • An assumption – People would really enjoy the enhanced clarity and color detail provided by 3D • A claim – People would not mind paying a lot more for a new 3D-enabled TV screen because of the new experience www.id-book.com Benefits of conceptualising • Orientation – enables design teams to ask specific questions about how the conceptual model will be understood • Open-minded – prevents design teams from becoming narrowly focused early on • Common ground – allows design teams to establish a set of commonly agreed terms www.id-book.com From problem space to design space • Having a good understanding of the problem space can help inform the design space – e.g. what kind of interface, behavior, functionality to provide • But before deciding upon these it is important to develop a conceptual model www.id-book.com Conceptual model • A conceptual model is: “…a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates” (Johnson and Henderson, 2002, p26) • Enables “…designers to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets” (Johnson and Henderson, 2002, p28) • Provides a working strategy and framework of general concepts and their interrelations www.id-book.com Components • Metaphors and analogies – understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity • Concepts that people are exposed to through the product – task–domain objects, their attributes, and operations (e.g. saving, revisiting, organizing) • Relationship and mappings between these concepts www.id-book.com First steps in formulating a conceptual model • What will the users be doing when carrying out their tasks? • How will the system support these? • What kind of interface metaphor, if any, will be appropriate? • What kinds of interaction modes and styles to use? - always keep in mind when making design decisions how the user will understand the underlying conceptual model www.id-book.com Conceptual models • Many kinds and ways of classifying them • The best conceptual models are often those that appear – obvious and simple – the operations they support are intuitive to use www.id-book.com Interface metaphors • Interface designed to be similar to a physical entity but also has own properties – e.g. desktop metaphor, web portals • Can be based on activity, object or a combination of both • Exploit user’s familiar knowledge, helping them to understand ‘the unfamiliar’ • Conjures up the essence of the unfamiliar activity, enabling users to leverage this to understand more aspects of the unfamiliar functionality www.id-book.com Examples of interface metaphors • Conceptualizing what users are doing, – e.g. surfing the web • A conceptual model instantiated at the interface, – e.g. the desktop metaphor • Visualizing an operation, • e.g. an icon of a shopping cart for placing items into www.id-book.com The card metaphor • The card is a very popular UI • Why?: Has familiar form factor • Can easily be flicked through, sorted, and themed • Can structure content into meaningful chunks – similar to how paragraphs are used to chunk a set of related sentences into distinct sections • Material properties giving appearance of surface of paper www.id-book.com Figure 3.5 Google Now card for restaurant recommendation in Germany Source: Johannes Shonning: schoening@uni-bremen.de. Benefits of interface metaphors • Makes learning new systems easier • Helps users understand the underlying conceptual model • Can be very innovative and enable the realm of computers and their applications to be made more accessible to a greater diversity of users www.id-book.com Problems with interface metaphors • Break conventional and cultural rules – e.g. recycle bin placed on desktop • Can constrain designers in the way they conceptualize a problem space • Conflict with design principles • Forces users to only understand the system in terms of the metaphor • Designers can inadvertently use bad existing designs and transfer the bad parts over • Limits designers’ imagination in coming up with new conceptual models www.id-book.com Activity • Describe the components of the conceptual model underlying most online shopping websites, e.g. – Shopping cart – Proceeding to check-out – 1-click – Gift wrapping – Cash till www.id-book.com Interaction types • Instructing – issuing commands and selecting options • Conversing – interacting with a system as if having a conversation • Manipulating – interacting with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them • Exploring – moving through a virtual environment or a physical space • Responding – the system initiates the interaction and the user chooses whether to respond www.id-book.com 1. Instructing • Where users instruct a system and tell it what to do – e.g. tell the time, print a file, save a file • Very common conceptual model, underlying a diversity of devices and systems – e.g. word processors, VCRs, vending machines • Main benefit is that instructing supports quick and efficient interaction – good for repetitive kinds of actions performed on multiple objects www.id-book.com Which is easiest and why? www.id-book.com 2. Conversing • Underlying model of having a conversation with another human • Range from simple voice recognition menu- driven systems to more complex ‘natural language’ dialogs • Examples include timetables, search engines, advice-giving systems, help systems • Also virtual agents, chatbots, toys and pet robots designed to converse with you www.id-book.com Pros and cons of conversational model • Allows users, especially novices to interact with a system in a way that is familiar to them – can make them feel comfortable, at ease and less scared • Misunderstandings can arise when the system does not know how to parse what the user says – e.g. voice assistants can misunderstand what children say www.id-book.com www.id-book.com 3. Manipulating • Involves dragging, selecting, opening, closing and zooming actions on virtual objects • Exploit’s users’ knowledge of how they move and manipulate in the physical world • Can involve actions using physical controllers (e.g. Wii) or air gestures (e.g. Kinect) to control the movements of an on screen avatar • Tagged physical objects (e.g. balls) that are manipulated in a physical world result in physical/digital events (e.g. animation) www.id-book.com Direct Manipulation (DM) • Ben Shneiderman (1983) coined the term DM • 3 core properties: – Continuous representation of objects and actions of interest – Physical actions and button pressing instead of issuing commands with complex syntax – Rapid reversible actions with immediate feedback on object of interest www.id-book.com Benefits of direct manipulation • Novices can learn the basic functionality quickly • Experienced users can work extremely rapidly to carry out a wide range of tasks, even defining new functions • Intermittent users can retain operational concepts over time • Error messages rarely needed • Users can immediately see if their actions are furthering their goals and if not do something else • Users experience less anxiety • Users gain confidence and mastery and feel in control www.id-book.com Disadvantages of DM • Some people take the metaphor of direct manipulation too literally • Not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be done directly • Some tasks are better achieved through delegating, e.g. spell checking • Can become screen space ‘gobblers’ • Moving a cursor using a mouse or touch pad can be slower than pressing function keys to do same actions www.id-book.com 4. Exploring • Involves moving through virtual or physical environments – users can explore aspects of a virtual 3D environment – physical environments can also be embedded with sensors that when detect the presence of someone will trigger digital or physical events to happen • Many examples of virtual environments, including cities, parks, buildings, rooms, and datasets – enable users to fly over them and zoom in and out of different parts www.id-book.com Seeing things larger than life in VR www.id-book.com Reproduced with permission. http://home.comcast.net/~sharov/3d/cave.html Exploring data in VR www.id-book.com Image courtesy of Kalev Leetaru, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois. Responding • System takes the initiative to alert user to something that it “thinks” is of interest • Does this by: – detecting the location and/or presence of someone in a vicinity and notifies them on their phone/watch, – what it has learned from their repeated behaviors • Examples: – alerts the user of a nearby coffee bar where some friends are meeting – user’s fitness tracker notifies them of a milestone reached • Automatic system response without any requests made by the user www.id-book.com This type suggested by Christopher Lueg et al. (2018) Potential cons of system initiated notifications • Can get tiresome or frustrating if too many or the system gets it wrong • What does it do when it gets something wrong? • Apologise? • Allow user to correct the advise or information? www.id-book.com Choosing an interaction type • Direct manipulation is good for ‘doing’ types of tasks, e.g. designing, drawing, flying, driving, sizing windows • Issuing instructions is good for repetitive tasks, e.g. spell-checking, file management • Having a conversation is good for certain services, e.g. finding information, requesting music • Hybrid conceptual models are good for supporting multiple ways of carrying out the same actions www.id-book.com Difference between interaction types and interface styles • Interaction type: – A description of what the user is doing when interacting with a system, e.g. instructing, talking, browsing or responding • Interface style: – the kind of interface used to support the interaction, e.g. command, menu-based, gesture, voice www.id-book.com Many kinds of interface styles available (see chapter 7)… • Command • Speech • Data-entry • Form fill-in • Query • Graphical • Web • Pen • Augmented reality • Gesture www.id-book.com Other sources • Of conceptual knowledge that are used to inform design and guide research are: – paradigms – visions – theories – models – frameworks www.id-book.com Paradigm • Inspiration for a conceptual model • General approach adopted by a community for carrying out research – shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices – e.g. desktop, ubiquitous computing, in the wild www.id-book.com Examples of new paradigms in HCI • Ubiquitous computing • Pervasive computing • Wearable computing • Internet of Things www.id-book.com Visions • A driving force that frames research and development • Invites people to imagine what life will be like in 10, 15 or 20 years time – e.g. Apple’s 1987 Knowledge Navigator – Smart Cities, Smart Health – Human-centred AI • Provide concrete scenarios of how society can use the next generation of imagined technologies • Also raise ethical questions, e.g. privacy, trust www.id-book.com Questions raised by tech visions • How to enable people to access and interact with information in their everyday lives • How to design user experiences where there is no obvious user control • How and in what form to provide contextually relevant information to people • How to ensure that information passed around interconnected devices, and objects is secure www.id-book.com Theory • Explanation of a phenomenon – e.g. information processing that explains how the mind, or some aspect of it, is assumed to work • Can help identify factors relevant to the design and evaluation of interactive products – e.g. cognitive, social, and affective • Can be used to predict what users will do with different interfaces www.id-book.com Models • A simplification of an HCI phenomenon – enables designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs – abstracted from a theory coming from a contributing discipline, e.g. – Don Norman’s (1996) model of the seven stages of action – Marc Hassenzahl’s (2010) model of the user experience www.id-book.com Frameworks • Set of interrelated concepts and/or specific questions for ‘what to look for • Provide advice on how to design user experiences – helping designers think about how to conceptualize learning, working, socializing, fun, emotion • Focus on how to design particular kinds of interfaces to evoke certain responses • Come in various forms: – e.g. steps, questions, concepts, challenges, principles, tactics and dimensions www.id-book.com A classic HCI framework Don Norman’s (1988) framework of the relationship between the design of a conceptual model and a user’s understanding of it • Consists of three interacting components: • The Designer’s Model – The model the designer has of how the system should work • System Image – How the system actually works, which is portrayed to the user through the interface, manuals, help facilities, and so on • The User’s Model – How the user understands how the system works www.id-book.com Summary • Developing a conceptual model involves: – understanding the problem space – Being clear about your assumptions and claims – specifying how the proposed design will support users • A conceptual model is a high-level description of a product in terms of – what users can do with it and the concepts they need to understand how to interact with it • Interaction types provide a way of thinking about how to support user’s activities • Paradigms, visions, theories, models & frameworks – provide ways of framing design and research www.id-book.com Chapter 4 COGNITIVE ASPECTS Overview • What is cognition?

• 2+2 = • 21 x 29 = • What color eyes do you have? • How many colors are there in the rainbow? • How many months in the year have 31 days? • What is the name of the first school you attended? www.id-book.com How can understanding cognition help? • Provides knowledge about what users can and cannot be expected to do • Identifies and explains the nature and causes of problems users encounter • Provides theories, modelling tools, guidance and methods that can lead to the design of better interactive products www.id-book.com Cognitive processes • Attention • Perception • Memory • Learning • Reading, speaking and listening • Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making www.id-book.com Attention • Selecting things to concentrate on at a point in time from the mass of stimuli around us • Allows us to focus on information that is relevant to what we are doing • Involves audio and/or visual senses • Focussed and divided attention – enables us to be selective in terms of the mass of competing stimuli but limits our ability to keep track of all events • Design recommendation – Information at the interface should be structured to capture users’ attention, e.g. use perceptual boundaries (windows), colour, reverse video, sound and flashing lights www.id-book.com Activity: Find the price of a double room at the Holiday Inn in Columbia www.id-book.com Activity: Find the price for a double room at the Quality Inn in Pennsylvania www.id-book.com Activity • Tullis (1987) found that the two screens produced quite different results – 1st screen - took an average of 5.5 seconds to search – 2nd screen - took 3.2 seconds to search • Why, since both displays have the same density of information (31%)? • Spacing – In the 1st screen the information is bunched up together, making it hard to search – In the 2nd screen the characters are grouped into vertical categories of information making it easier www.id-book.com Multitasking and attention • Is it possible to perform multiple tasks without one or more of them being detrimentally affected? • Multitasking can cause people to lose their train of thought, make errors, and need to start over • Ophir et al (2009) compared heavy vs light multi- taskers – heavy were more prone to being distracted than those who infrequently multitask – heavy multi-taskers are easily distracted and find it difficult to filter irrelevant information www.id-book.com Multitasking experiment • Lotteridge et al. (2015) conducted another study involving writing an essay under 2 conditions: relevant or irrelevant information – heavy multitaskers were easily distracted but able to put this to good use if the distracting sources were relevant to the task in hand – irrelevant information was found to negatively impact task performance www.id-book.com Multitasking at work • Increasingly common for workers to multitask – e.g. hospital workers have to attend to multiple screens in an operating room that provide new kinds of real-time information – requires clinician’s constant attention to check if any data is unusual or anomalous – need to develop new attention and scanning strategies www.id-book.com Is it OK to use a phone when driving? www.id-book.com No! – Driving is very demanding – Drivers are prone to being distracted – There is a significant chance of causing accidents – Drivers’ reaction times are longer to external events when talking on the phone in a car (Caird et al., 2018) – Phone drivers rely more on their expectations about what is likely to happen next as conversation taking up their attention – Response time is slower to unexpected events (Briggs et al., 2018) – Drivers often try to imagine what the other person’s face is like – whom they are talking to • this competes with the processing resources needed to enable them to notice and react to what is in front of them www.id-book.com Are hands-free phones safer to use when driving? • No, as same type of cognitive processing is happening when talking • Same happens when talking with front seat passenger – but both can stop in mid-sentence if see a hazard meaning driver can switch immediately to the road – So less dangerous talking to a front seat passenger than a remote person – a remote person on the end of a phone is not privy to what the driver is seeing and will carry on the conversation when there is a hazard – makes it difficult for the driver to switch all their attention to the road www.id-book.com Design implications for attention • Context: Make information salient when it needs attending to at a given stage of a task • Use techniques to achieve this – e.g. color, ordering, spacing, underlining, sequencing and animation • Avoid cluttering visual interfaces with too much information • Consider designing different ways of supporting effective switching and returning to an interface www.id-book.com Perception • How information is acquired from the world and transformed into experiences • Obvious implication is to design representations that are readily perceivable, e.g. – Text should be legible – Icons should be easy to distinguish and read www.id-book.com Is color contrast good? Find Italian www.id-book.com Are borders and white space better? Find french www.id-book.com Activity • Weller (2004) found people took less time to locate items for information that was grouped – using a border (2nd screen) compared with using color contrast (1st screen) • Some argue that too much white space on web pages is detrimental to search process – Makes it hard to find information • Do you agree? www.id-book.com Activity: Which is easiest to read and why? What is the time? What is the time? What is the time? What is the time? What is the time? www.id-book.com Design implications • Icons should enable users to readily distinguish their meaning • Bordering and spacing are effective visual ways of grouping information • Sounds should be audible and distinguishable • Research proper color contrast techniques when designing an interface – Yellow on black or blue is fine – Yellow on green or white is a no-no • Haptic feedback should be used judiciously www.id-book.com Memory • Involves recalling various kinds of knowledge that allow people to act appropriately – e.g. recognize someone’s face, remember someone’s name • First encode and then retrieve knowledge • We don’t remember everything - involves filtering and processing what is attended to • Context is important as to how we remember (i.e. where, when) • We recognize things much better than being able to recall things • We remember less about objects we have photographed than when we observe them with the naked eye (Henkel, 2014) www.id-book.com Processing in memory • Encoding is first stage of memory – determines which information is attended to in the environment and how it is interpreted • The more attention paid to something… • The more it is processed in terms of thinking about it and comparing it with other knowledge… • The more likely it is to be remembered – e.g. when learning about HCI, it is much better to reflect upon it, carry out exercises, have discussions with others about it, and write notes than just passively read a book, listen to a lecture or watch a video about it www.id-book.com Context is important • Context affects the extent to which information can be subsequently retrieved • Sometimes it can be difficult for people to recall information that was encoded in a different context: – “You are on a train and someone comes up to you and says hello. You don’t recognize him for a few moments but then realize it is one of your neighbors. You are only used to seeing your neighbor in the hallway of your apartment block and seeing him out of context makes him difficult to recognize initially” www.id-book.com Activity • Try to remember the dates of your grandparents’ birthday • Try to remember the cover of the last two books you read • Which was easiest? Why? • People are very good at remembering visual cues about things – e.g. the color of items, the location of objects and marks on an object • They find it more difficult to learn and remember arbitrary material – e.g. birthdays and phone numbers www.id-book.com Recognition versus recall • Command-based interfaces require users to recall from memory a name from a possible set of 100s • Graphical interfaces provide visually-based options (menus, icons) that users need only browse through until they recognize one • Web browsers provide tabs and history lists of visited URLs that support recognition memory www.id-book.com The problem with the classic ‘72’ • George Miller’s (1956) theory of how much information people can remember • People’s immediate memory capacity is very limited to 7 2 • Has been applied in interaction design when considering how many options to display • But is it a good use of a theory in HCI? • Is it helpful? www.id-book.com When creating an interface should the designer • Present only 7 options on a menu • Display only 7 icons on a tool bar • Have no more than 7 bullets in a list • Place only 7 items on a pull down menu • Place only 7 tabs on the top of a website page? • Not necessarily.. www.id-book.com The reason is… • People can scan lists of bullets, tabs, menu items for the one they want • They don’t have to recall them from memory having only briefly heard or seen them • So can have more than 9 at the interface (e.g. history lists of websites visited) • Sometimes a small number of items is good – e.g. smart watch displays • Depends on task and available screen estate www.id-book.com Personal Information management • Is a growing problem for many users – they accumulate a vast numbers of documents, images, music files, video clips, emails, attachments, bookmarks, etc., – where and how to save them all, then remembering what they were called and where to find them again – naming most common means of encoding them – but can be difficult to remember, especially when have 10,000s – How might such a process be facilitated taking into account people’s memory abilities? www.id-book.com Personal Information management • Bergman and Whittaker 3 interdependent processes model (2016) to help people manage their stuff: (i) how to decide what stuff to keep (ii) how to organize it when storing (iii) which strategies to use to retrieve it later • Most common approach is to use folders and naming • Strong preference for scanning across and within folders when looking for something • Search engines only helpful if know the name of the file • Smart search engines help with listing relevant files for partial name or when type in first letter www.id-book.com Apple’s Spotlight search tool www.id-book.com Memory load • Online/mobile and phone banking now require users to provide multiple pieces of information to access their account – e.g. ZIP code, birthplace, a memorable date, first school attended – Known as multifactor authentication (MFA) • Why? – Increased security concerns • Password managers such as LastPass have been developed - only need one master password – Reduce stress and memory load on users • Passwords could become extinct with the widespread use of biometrics and computer vision algorithms www.id-book.com Digital Forgetting • When might you wish to forget something that is online? – When you break up with a partner – Emotionally painful to be reminded of them through shared photos, social media, etc., • Sas and Whittaker (2013) suggest ways of harvesting and deleting digital content – e.g. making photos of ex into an abstract collage – helps with closure www.id-book.com Memory aids • SenseCam developed by Microsoft Research Labs (now Autographer) – a wearable device that intermittently takes photos without any user intervention while worn – digital images taken are stored and revisited using special software – has been found to improve people’s memory, especially those suffering from dementia • Other aids include RemArc which triggers long term memory using old BBC materials www.id-book.com SenseCam www.id-book.com Design implications • Reduce cognitive load by avoiding long and complicated procedures for carrying out tasks • Design interfaces that promote recognition rather than recall • Provide users with various ways of labelling digital information to help them easily identify it again – e.g. folders, categories, color, flagging, time stamping www.id-book.com Learning • Involves the accumulation of skills and knowledge involving memory • Two main types: – Incidental learning (e.g. recognizing people’s faces, what you did today) – intentional learning (e.g. studying for an exam, learning to cook) – Intentional learning is much harder! – Many technologies have been developed to help (e.g. multimedia, animations, VR) • People find it hard to learn by following instructions in a manual • Prefer to learn by doing www.id-book.com Design implications • Design interfaces that encourage exploration • Design interfaces that constrain and guide learners • Dynamically linking concepts and representations can facilitate the learning of complex material www.id-book.com Reading, speaking, and listening • The ease with which people can read, listen, or speak differs – Many prefer listening to reading – Reading can be quicker than speaking or listening – Listening requires less cognitive effort than reading or speaking – Dyslexics have difficulties understanding and recognizing written words www.id-book.com Applications • Voice user interfaces allow users to interact with them by asking questions – e.g. Google Voice, Siri, Alexa • Speech-output systems use artificially generated speech – e.g. written-text-to-speech systems for the visually impaired • Natural-language systems enable users to type in questions and give text-based responses – e.g. chatbots www.id-book.com Design implications • Speech-based menus and instructions should be short • Accentuate the intonation of artificially generated speech voices – they are harder to understand than human voices • Provide opportunities for making text large on a screen www.id-book.com Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making • All these processes involve reflective cognition – e.g. thinking about what to do, what the options are, and the consequences • Often involves conscious processes, discussion with others (or oneself), and the use of artifacts – e.g. maps, books, pen and paper • May involve working through different scenarios and deciding which is best option • Weighing up alternatives www.id-book.com Design implications • Provide information and help pages that are easy to access for people who wish to understand more about how to carry out an activity more effectively (e.g. web searching) • Use simple and memorable functions to support rapid decision-making and planning www.id-book.com Dilemma • The app mentality is making it worse for people to make their own decisions because they are becoming risk averse (Gardner and Davis, 2013) – Instead they now rely on a multitude of apps – This makes them increasingly anxious – Unable to make decisions by themselves – Need to resort to looking up info, getting other’s opinions on social media and comparing notes • Do you agree? • Did it happen to you when deciding which university/school to go to? www.id-book.com Cognitive frameworks • These are used to explain and predict user behavior at the interface – based on theories of behavior – focus is on mental processes that take place – Also use of artifacts and representations • Most well known are: – Mental models – Gulfs of execution and evaluation – Distributed cognition – External and embodied cognition www.id-book.com Mental models • Users develop an understanding of a system through learning about and using it • Knowledge is sometimes described as a mental model: – how to use the system (what to do next) – what to do with unfamiliar systems or unexpected situations (how the system works) • People make inferences using mental models of how to carry out tasks www.id-book.com Mental models • Craik (1943) described mental models as: – internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made • Involves unconscious and conscious processes – imagery and analogies are activated • Deep versus shallow models – e.g. how to drive a car and how it works www.id-book.com Everyday reasoning and mental models (a) You arrive home on a cold winter’s night to a cold house. How do you get the house to warm up as quickly as possible? Set the thermostat to be at its highest or to the desired temperature? (b) You arrive home starving hungry. You look in the fridge and find all that is left is an uncooked pizza. You have an electric oven. Do you warm it up to 375 degrees first and then put it in (as specified by the instructions) or turn the oven up higher to try to warm it up quicker? www.id-book.com Heating up a room or oven that is thermostat-controlled • Many people when asked (a) choose the first option • Why? – Think It will heat the room up quicker – General valve theory, where ‘more is more’ principle is generalised to different settings (e.g. gas pedal, gas cooker, tap, radio volume) – Burt it is a wrong mental model as thermostats based on model of on-off switch model • Many people when asked (b) choose the first option – Electric ovens work on the same principle as thermostats • Most of us have erroneous mental models (Kempton, 1996) www.id-book.com Erroneous mental models • Lots of people hit the button for elevators and pedestrian crossings at least twice – Why? Think it will make the lights change faster or ensure the elevator arrives! • What kinds of mental models do users have for understanding how interactive devices work? – poor, often incomplete, easily confusable, based on inappropriate analogies and superstition (Norman, 1983) www.id-book.com How can UX be designed to help people build better mental models? • Clear and easy to use instructions • Appropriate tutorials and contextual sensitive guidance • Provide online videos and chatbot windows when needing help • Transparency – to make interfaces intuitive to use • Affordances of what actions an interface allows – e.g. swiping, clicking, selecting www.id-book.com Gulfs of execution and evaluation • The ‘gulfs’ explicate the gaps that exist between the user and the interface • The gulf of execution – the distance from the user to the physical system • The gulf of evaluation – the distance from the physical system to the user • Bridging the gulfs can reduce cognitive effort required to perform tasks • Can reveal whether interface increases or decreases cognitive load and whether it is obvious what to do next Norman, 1986; Hutchins et al, 1986 www.id-book.com Bridging the gulfs www.id-book.com Information processing • Conceptualizes human performance in metaphorical terms of information processing stages www.id-book.com Limitations • Based on modelling mental activities that happen exclusively inside the head • Do not adequately account for how people interact with computers and other devices in real world www.id-book.com Distributed cognition • Concerned with the nature of cognitive phenomena across individuals, artifacts, and internal and external representations (Hutchins, 1995) • Describes these in terms of propagation across representational state • Information is transformed through different media (computers, displays, paper, heads) www.id-book.com A cognitive system for ATC www.id-book.com What’s involved • The distributed problem-solving that takes place • The role of verbal and non-verbal behavior • The various coordinating mechanisms that are used (e.g. rules, procedures) • The communication that takes place as the collaborative activity progresses • How knowledge is shared and accessed www.id-book.com External cognition • Concerned with explaining how we interact with external representations (e.g. maps, notes, diagrams) • What are the cognitive benefits and what processes involved • How they extend cognition • What technologies can we develop to help people carry out complex tasks (e.g. learning, problem solving, decision-making)? www.id-book.com Externalizing to reduce memory load • Examples include the use of diaries, reminders, calendars, notes, shopping lists, to-do lists – written to remind us of what to do • Post-its, piles, marked emails are used to: – where placed indicates priority of what to do • External representations: – Remind us that we need to do something (e.g. to buy something for mother’s day) – Remind us of what to do (e.g. buy a card) – Remind us when to do something (e.g. send a card by a certain date) www.id-book.com Computational offloading • When a tool is used in conjunction with an external representation to carry out a computation (e.g. pen and paper) • Try doing the two sums below (a) in your head, (b) on a piece of paper and c) with a calculator. 234 x 456 =?? CCXXXIIII x CCCCXXXXXVI = ??? • Which is easiest and why? Both are identical sums www.id-book.com Annotation and cognitive tracing • Annotation involves modifying existing representations through making marks – e.g. crossing off, ticking, underlining • Cognitive tracing involves externally manipulating items into different orders or structures – e.g. playing Scrabble, playing cards www.id-book.com Design implication • Provide external representations at the interface that can reduce memory load and facilitate computational offloading – e.g. Information visualizations have been designed to allow people to make sense and rapid decisions about masses of data www.id-book.com Embodied Interaction • The practical engagement with the social and physical environment (Dourish, 2001) • Creating, manipulating and making meaning through our interaction with things • How our bodies and active experiences shape how we perceive, feel, and think (Hornecker et al., 2017) • They enable us to develop a sense of the world at both a concrete and abstract level • Can provide new ideas about interaction and better design principles – e.g. we think with our bodies not through them (Kirsh, 2013) www.id-book.com Summary • Cognition involves many processes including attention, memory, perception and learning • The way an interface is designed can greatly affect how well users can perceive, attend, learn and remember how to do their tasks • Theoretical frameworks, such as mental models and external cognition, provide ways of understanding how and why people interact with products • This can lead to thinking about how to design better products www.id-book.com In-depth activity Write down how you think a contactless card or smartphone app like Apple Pay works • What information is sent between the card/smartphone and the card reader when it is placed in front of it? • What is the maximum amount you can pay for something using a contactless card, Apple Pay or Google Pay? • Why is there an upper limit? • How many times can you use a contactless card or Apple/Google Pay in a day? • What happens if you have two contactless cards in the same wallet/purse? • What happens when your contactless card is stolen and you report it to the bank?

• How would you design an interface for when someone is happy, angry, sad, bored, focussed? www.id-book.com How do emotions affect behavior and behavior emotions? • Examine how people express themselves and read each other (emotional intelligence) – understand relationship between facial expressions, body language, gestures and tone of voice, e.g. – when people are happy they laugh and relax body posture – when they are angry they screw up their face • Does being angry make you concentrate better or more distracted? • When you are happy do you take more risks such as spend more money or buy more? • Baumeister et al (2007) argue the relationship is more complex than a single cause-and-effect model www.id-book.com Automatic (affect) versus conscious emotions • Emotions can be short-lived (e.g. fit of anger) or complex and long-lasting (e.g. jealousy) • Have been categorized as automatic or conscious – Automatic ones are rapid and dissipate quickly – Conscious ones develop slowly and take a long time to go (e.g. reflection) www.id-book.com Ortony et al (2005) model of emotional design www.id-book.com Claims from model • Our emotional state changes how we think – when frightened or angry we focus narrowly and body responds by tensing muscles and sweating • more likely to be less tolerant – when happy we are less focused and the body relaxes – More likely to overlook minor problems and be more creative www.id-book.com Designing with the three levels in mind • Visceral design refers o making products look, feel and sound good • Behavioral design is about use and equates with traditional values of usability • Reflective design is about considering the meaning and personal value of a product www.id-book.com Analyzing a swatch watch design using the model • Cultural images and graphical elements designed at reflective level • Affordances of use at behavioral level • Brilliant colors and wild design attract user’s attention at visceral level www.id-book.com Expressive interfaces • Provide reassuring feedback that can be both informative and fun • But can also be intrusive, causing people to get annoyed and even angry • Color, icons, sounds, graphical elements and animations are used to make the ‘look and feel’ of an interface appealing – conveys an emotional state • In turn this can affect the usability of an interface – people are prepared to put up with certain aspects of an interface (e.g. slow download rate) if the end result is appealing and aesthetic www.id-book.com The appearance of an interface • (a) Emotional icons were used in the 80s to indicate rebooting or crashed – smiling apple face • (b) Nowadays use more impersonal but aesthetically pleasing icons to indicate user needs to wait – the beachball www.id-book.com The design of thermostats • (a) The Nest has a minimalist and aesthetically pleasing design – Round face and simple dial – Large font and numbers • (b) Very different from earlier thermostat designs – utilitarian and dull www.id-book.com Annoying interfaces • Microsoft pioneered friendly interfaces for technophobes – e.g. ‘At home with Bob’ software – 3D metaphors based on familiar places (e.g. living rooms) • Agents in the guise of pets (e.g. bunny, dog) were included to talk to the user – Make users feel more at ease and comfortable – But many people did not like the idea of Bob so never made it to product www.id-book.com At home with Bob www.id-book.com Microsoft’s Clippy and IKEA’s Anna • Clippy did… • But was disliked by so many? – Was it annoying, distracting, patronising or other? • Anna appeared as a virtual agent – Blinked, moved her lips and head to suggest facial expressions www.id-book.com Frustrating interfaces • Many causes: – When an application doesn’t work properly or crashes – When a system doesn’t do what the user wants it to do – When a user’s expectations are not met – When a system does not provide sufficient information to enable the user to know what to do – When error messages pop up that are vague, obtuse or condemning – When the appearance of an interface is garish, noisy, gimmicky or patronizing – When a system requires users to carry out too many steps to perform a task, only to discover a mistake was made earlier and they need to start all over again www.id-book.com Error messages “The application Word Wonder has unexpectedly quit due to a type 2 error.” Why not instead: “the application has expectedly quit due to poor coding in the operating system” • Shneiderman’s classic guidelines for error messages include: • avoid using terms like FATAL, INVALID, BAD • Audio warnings • Avoid UPPERCASE and long code numbers • Messages should be precise rather than vague • Provide context-sensitive help www.id-book.com A friendly cute image instead of the impersonal 404 error message www.id-book.com Dilemma: Should computers say they’re sorry? • Reeves and Naas (1996) argue that computers should be made to apologize • Should emulate human etiquette • Would users be as forgiving of computers saying sorry as people are of each other when saying sorry? • How sincere would they think the computer was being? For example, after a system crash: – “I’m really sorry I crashed. I’ll try not to do it again” • How else should computers communicate with users? www.id-book.com Dilemma: Should Voice assistants teach kids good manners? • Many children talk to Alexa as if she was their friend • They also learn that it is not necessary to say please and thank you to her when asking questions • Is this lack of using etiquette a problem? • Would it transfer over to real life situations? – e.g. demanding “Aunty, get me my drink.” • Parents should still teach their kids good manners • Alexa can be configured to be polite as well • How much parental control should voice assistants be given? • Would children find it weird or creepy that their Alexa (who is their friend) nags them to clean their teeth? www.id-book.com Affective Computing and Emotional AI • Affective computing concerned with how to use computers to recognize and express emotions as humans do (Picard, 1998) • Involves designing ways for people to communicate their emotional state • Uses sensing technologies to measure GSR, facial expressions, gestures, body movement • Explores how affect influences personal health • Emotional AI aims to automate the measurement of feelings and behavior using AI to infer them from facial expressions and voice • Aim is to predict user’s emotions and aspects of their behavior – e.g. what is someone most likely to buy online when feeling sad, bored or happy www.id-book.com Techniques used • Cameras for measuring facial expressions • . • Biosensors placed on fingers or palms to measure GSR • Affective expression in speech (e.g. intonation, pitch, loudness) • Body movement and gestures using accelerometers and motion capture systems www.id-book.com Classification of emotions • Six core expressions typically measured: – sadness, disgust, fear, anger, contempt, joy • Type of facial expression chosen by AI through detecting presence of absence of: – Smiling, eye widening, brow raising, brow furrowing, raising a cheek, mouth opening, upper-lip raising, wrinkling of the nose www.id-book.com Facial coding using Affdex software www.id-book.com How is this emotional data used? • If user screws up their face when an ad pops up -> feel disgust • If start smiling -> they are feeling happy • Website can adapt its ad, movie storyline or content to match user’s emotional state • If system used in a car it might detect an angry driver and suggest driver takes a deep breath • Eye-tracking, finger pulse, speech and words/phrases also analysed when tweeting or posting to Facebook www.id-book.com Indirect emotion detection • Also used more to infer or predict someone’s behavior – e.g. determining a person’s suitability for a job or how they will vote at an election • Do you think it is ethical that technology can read your emotions from your facial expressions or from your tweets? www.id-book.com Persuasive technologies and behavioral change • Interacive computing systems designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviors (Fogg, 2003) • A diversity of techniques now used to change what they do or think – Pop-up ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, recommendations, Amazon 1-click – Commonly referred to as nudging www.id-book.com 32 Nintendo’s Pocket Pikachu • Was developed to change bad habits and improve well being – Designed to motivate children to be more physically active on a regular basis – owner of the digital pet that ‘lives’in the device is required to walk, run, or jump – If owner does not exercise the virtual pet becomes angry and refuses to play anymore www.id-book.com How effective? • Can interactive technologies that monitor, nag, or behave like a human keep them interested in looking after it and in doing so fitter, themselves? • How does looking after a virtual pet change a child’s behavior? – Emotional attachment – Happy Pokemon makes them feel good – Sulking Pokemon makes them feel bad www.id-book.com Tracking devices • Mobile apps designed to help people monitor and change their behaviour (e.g. fitness, sleeping, weight) • Can compare with online leader boards and charts, to show how they have done in relation to their peers and friends • Also apps that encourage reflection that in turn increase well-being and happiness www.id-book.com Sustainable HCI • Focus on designing tech interventions to help people reduce their energy consumption • An effective technique is to provide householders with feedback on their consumption • Simple infographics and emoticons are often most powerful – Encourage people to reflect and see what they can change to reduce their energy consumption • Peer pressure and social norms are also powerful methods www.id-book.com The Tidy Street project • :arge-scale visualization of the street’s electricity usage – stenciled display on the road surface using chalk – provided realtime feedback that all could see change each day – reduced electricity consumption by 15% www.id-book.com Bird and Rogers, 2010) Phishing scams • Web used to deceive people into parting with personal details – e.g. Paypal, eBay, and won the lottery letters • Allows Internet fraudsters to access their bank accounts and draw money from them • Many vulnerable people fall for it • The art of deception is centuries old but internet allows ever more ingenious ways to trick people www.id-book.com Anthropomorphism • Attributing human-like qualities to inanimate objects (e.g. cars, computers) • Well known phenomenon in advertising – dancing butter, drinks, breakfast cereals • Much exploited in human-computer interaction – make user experience enjoyable, motivating, make people feel at ease, reduce anxiety • Furnishing technologies with personalities can make them enjoyable to interact with www.id-book.com Which message you prefer? As a welcome message: • “Hello Chris! Nice to see you again. Welcome back. Now what were we doing last time? Oh yes, exercise 5. Let’s start again.” • “User 24, commence exercise 5.” www.id-book.com Which do you prefer? • Feedback when user gets something wrong: 1. “Now Chris, that’s not right. You can do better than that. Try again.” 2. “Incorrect. Try again.” • Is there a difference as to what you prefer depending on type of message? Why? www.id-book.com Evidence to support anthropomorphism • Reeves and Naas (1996) found that computers that flatter and praise users in education software programs -> positive impact on them “Your question makes an important and useful distinction. Great job!” • Students were more willing to continue with exercises with this kind of feedback www.id-book.com 42 Robot-like or cuddly? Which do you prefer and why? www.id-book.com Aibo The Haptic Creature Is it OK for senior people to develop an emotional attachment with the robot Zora? www.id-book.com Summary • Emotional aspects of interaction design are concerned with how to facilitate certain states (e.g. pleasure) or avoid reactions (e.g. frustration) • Well-designed interfaces can elicit good feelings in people • Aesthetically pleasing interfaces can be a pleasure to use • Expressive interfaces can provide reassuring feedback to users • Badly designed interfaces make people frustrated, annoyed, or angry • Emotional AI and affective computing use AI and sensor technology for detecting people’s emotions through analyzing their facial expressions and conversations • Emotional technologies can be designed to persuade people to change their behaviors • Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human qualities to objects • Increasingly robots are being used as companions in the home www.id-book.com Chapter 7 INTERFACES Overview • Interface types – highlight the main design and research considerations for each of the different interfaces • Consider which interface is best for a given application or activity www.id-book.com 20 interface types covered www.id-book.com 1. Command 2. Graphical 3. Multimedia 4. Virtual reality 5. Web 6. Mobile 7. Appliance 8. Voice 9. Pen 10. Touch 11. Gesture 12. Haptic 13. Multimodal 14. Shareable 15. Tangible 16. Augmented Reality 17. Wearables 18. Robots and drones 19. Brain–computer interaction 20. Smart Command line interfaces • Commands such as abbreviations (e.g. ls) typed in at the prompt to which the system responds (e.g. listing current files) • Some are hard wired at keyboard, others can be assigned to keys • Efficient, precise, and fast • Large overhead to learning set of commands www.id-book.com Second Life command-based interface for visually impaired users www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Form, name types and structure are key research questions • Consistency is most important design principle – e.g. always use first letter of command • Command interfaces popular for web scripting www.id-book.com Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) • Xerox Star first WIMP gave rise to GUIs • Windows – Sections of the screen that can be scrolled, stretched, overlapped, opened, closed, and moved around the screen using the mouse • Icons – Pictograms that represent applications, objects, commands, and tools that were opened when clicked on • Menus – lists of options that can be scrolled through and selected • Pointing device – a mouse controlling the cursor as a point of entry to the windows, menus, and icons on the screen www.id-book.com Example of 1st generation GUI www.id-book.com Simple smartwatch menus with 1, 2 or 3 options www.id-book.com Window design • Windows were invented to overcome physical constraints of a computer display – enable more information to be viewed and tasks to be performed • Scroll bars within windows enable more information to be viewed • Multiple windows can make it difficult to find desired one – listing, tabbing, thumbnails, are techniques that can help www.id-book.com Window design: Thumbnails of top websites visited and suggested highlights www.id-book.com Selecting a country from a scrolling window www.id-book.com Is this method any better? www.id-book.com Menu styles • Flat list - good for showing large number of options at the same time when display is small • Drop down – show more options on same screen – e.g. cascading • Pop-up – when press command key for relevant options • Contextual – provide access to often used commands associated with a particular item • Collapsible – toggle between + and - icons on a header to expand or contract its contents • Mega – all options shown using 2D drop-down layout www.id-book.com Template for a collapsible menu www.id-book.com A mega menu www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Window management – enables users to move fluidly between different windows (and monitors) • How to switch attention between windows without getting distracted • Design principles of spacing, grouping, and simplicity should be used • Which terms to use for menu options (e.g. “Front” versus “bring to front” • Mega menus easier to navigate than drop-down ones www.id-book.com Icon design • Icons are assumed to be easier to learn and remember than commands • Can be designed to be compact and variably positioned on a screen • Now pervasive in every interface – e.g. represent desktop objects, tools (e.g. paintbrush), applications (e.g. web browser), and operations (e.g. cut, paste, next, accept, change) www.id-book.com Icons • Since the Xerox Star days icons have changed in their look and feel: – black and white -> color, shadowing, photorealistic images, 3D rendering, and animation • Many designed to be very detailed and animated making them both visually attractive and informative • Can be highly inviting, emotionally appealing, and feel alive www.id-book.com Icon forms • The mapping between the representation and underlying referent can be: – similar (e.g., a picture of a file to represent the object file) – analogical (e.g., a picture of a pair of scissors to represent ‘cut) – arbitrary (e.g., the use of an X to represent ‘delete’) • Most effective icons are similar ones • Many operations are actions making it more difficult to represent them – use a combination of objects and symbols that capture the salient part of an action www.id-book.com 2 types of icon styles www.id-book.com Flat 2D icons for smartphone and smartwatch www.id-book.com Activity • Sketch simple icons to represent the following operations to appear on a digital camera screen: – Turn image 90 degrees sideways – Auto-enhance the image – Crop the image – More options • Show them to someone else and see if they can understand what each represents www.id-book.com Basic edit icons that appear on the iPhone app www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • There is a wealth of resources for creating icons – guidelines, style guides, icon builders, libraries, online tutorials • Text labels can be used alongside icons to help identification for small icon sets • For large icon sets (e.g. photo editing or word processing) can use the hover function www.id-book.com Multimedia • Combines different media within a single interface with various forms of interactivity – graphics, text, video, sound, and animations • Users click on links in an image or text -> another part of the program -> an animation or a video clip is played ->can return to where they were or move on to another place • Can provide better ways of presenting information than can a single media www.id-book.com Pros and cons • Facilitates rapid access to multiple representations of information • Can provide better ways of presenting information than can any media alone • Can enable easier learning, better understanding, more engagement, and more pleasure • Can encourage users to explore different parts of a game or story • Tendency to play video clips and animations, while skimming through accompanying text or diagrams www.id-book.com Multimedia learning app designed for tablet www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • How to design multimedia to help users explore, keep track of, and integrate the multiple representations – provide hands-on interactivities and simulations that the user has to complete to solve a task – Provide quizzes, electronic notebooks, and games • Multimedia good for supporting certain activities, such as browsing but less optimal for reading at length www.id-book.com Virtual reality • Computer-generated graphical simulations providing: – “the illusion of participation in a synthetic environment rather than external observation of such an environment” (Gigante, 1993) • Provide new kinds of experience, enabling users to interact with objects and navigate in 3D space • Create highly engaging user experiences www.id-book.com Pros and cons • Can have a higher level of fidelity with objects they represent compared to multimedia • Induces a sense of presence where someone is totally engrossed by the experience – “a state of consciousness, the (psychological) sense of being in the virtual environment” (Slater and Wilbur, 1999) • Provides different viewpoints: 1st and 3rd person • Early head-mounted displays were uncomfortable to wear, and can cause motion sickness and disorientation • Lighter VR headsets now available (e.g. HTC Vive) with more accurate head tracking www.id-book.com Application areas • Video games • Arcade games for social groups • Therapy for fears • Experience how others feel emotions – e.g. empathy and compassion • Enrich user’s planning experience for travel destinations • Architecture, design, and education www.id-book.com Polygon graphics used to represent avatars for the We Wait VR experience www.id-book.com Steed et al., 2018 Research and design considerations • Much research on how to design safe and realistic VRs to facilitate training – e.g. flying simulators – help people overcome phobias (e.g. spiders, talking in public) • Design issues – how best to navigate through them (e.g. first versus third person) – how to control interactions and movements (e.g. use of head and body movements) – how best to interact with information (e.g. use of keypads, pointing, joystick buttons); – level of realism to aim for to engender a sense of presence www.id-book.com Website design • Early websites were largely text-based, providing hyperlinks • Concern was with how best to structure information to enable users to navigate and access it easily and quickly • Nowadays, more emphasis on making pages distinctive, striking, and aesthetically pleasing • Need to think of how to design information for multi- platforms - keyboard or touch? – e.g. smartphones, tablets, PCs www.id-book.com Usability versus aesthetics? • Vanilla or multi-flavor design? – ease of finding something versus aesthetic and enjoyable experience • Web designers are: – “thinking great literature” • Users read the web like a: – “billboard going by at 60 miles an hour” (Krug, 2014) • Need to determine how to brand a web page to catch and keep ‘eyeballs’ www.id-book.com Breadcrumbs for navigation www.id-book.com • Breadcrumbs are category labels – Enable users to look at other pages without losing track of where they have come from – Very usable – Enable once-click access to higher site levels – Attract first time visitors to continue to browse a website having viewed the landing page In your face Web ads • Web advertising is often intrusive and pervasive • Flashing, aggressive, persistent, annoying • Often need to be ‘actioned’ to get rid of • What is the alternative? – Use ad blockers www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Many books and guidelines on website design • Veen’s (2001) 3 core questions to consider when designing any website: (1) Where am I? (2) Where can I go? (3) What’s here? www.id-book.com Activity • Look at a fashion brand’s website, e.g. Nike.com • What kind of website is it? • How does it contravene the design principles outlined by Veen? • Does it matter? • What kind of user experience is it providing for? • What was your experience of engaging with it? www.id-book.com Mobile interfaces • Handheld devices intended to be used while on the move • Have become pervasive, increasingly used in all aspects of everyday and working life – e.g. Phones, fitness trackers, watches • Larger sized tablets used in mobile settings – e.g. flight attendants, marketing professionals, car rental returns www.id-book.com iBeer app www.id-book.com QR codes and smartphones www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Mobile interfaces can be cumbersome to use for those with poor manual dexterity or ‘fat’ fingers • Key concern is hit area – area on the phone display that the user touches to make something happen, such as a key, an icon, a button or an app – space needs to be big enough for all fingers to accurately press – if too small the user may accidentally press the wrong key – Fitts’ Law can be used to help design right spacing • Minimum tappable areas should be 44pts x 44pts for all controls www.id-book.com Appliances • Everyday devices in home, public place, or car – e.g. washing machines, remotes, toasters, printers and navigation systems) • And personal devices – e.g. digital clock and digital camera • Used for short periods – e.g. putting the washing on, watching a program, buying a ticket, changing the time, taking a snapshot • Need to be usable with minimal, if any, learning www.id-book.com Simple toaster control www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Need to design as transient interfaces with short interactions • Simple interfaces • Consider trade-off between soft and hard controls – e.g. use of buttons or keys, dials or scrolling www.id-book.com Voice User Interfaces • Involves a person talking with a spoken language app, e.g. timetable, travel planner, phone service • Used most for inquiring about specific information, e.g. flight times or to perform a transaction, e.g. buy a ticket • Also used by people with visual impairments – e.g. speech recognition word processors, page scanners, web readers, home control systems www.id-book.com Have speech interfaces come of age? www.id-book.com Modeling human conversations • People often interrupt each other in a conversation – especially the case when ordering in a restaurant – rather than let the waiter go through all the options • Speech technology has a similar feature called ‘barge-in’ – Users can choose an option before the system will has finished listing all the options available www.id-book.com Structuring VUI dialogs • Directed dialogs are where the system is in control of the conversation – Where it asks specific questions and requires specific responses • More flexible systems allow the user to take the initiative: e.g. “I’d like to go to Paris next Monday for two weeks.” • But more chance of error, since caller might assume that the system is like a human • Guided prompts can help callers back on track – e.g. “Sorry I did not get all that. Did you say you wanted to fly next Monday?” www.id-book.com Voice assistants (e.g. Alexa) • Have become popular in many homes • Allow all to use rather than being single use • Support families playing games, interactive storytelling, jokes, etc., • Can encourage social and emotional bonding • But young children (under 4) find it difficult to be understood by the voice assistants – frustrating for them www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • How to design systems that can keep conversation on track – help people navigate efficiently through a menu system – enable them to easily recover from errors – guide those who are vague or ambiguous in their requests for information or services • Type of voice actor (e.g. male, female, neutral, or dialect) – do people prefer to listen to and are more patient with a female or male voice, a northern or southern accent? www.id-book.com Pen-based devices • Enable people to write, draw, select, and move objects at an interface using light pens or styluses – capitalize on the well-honed drawing skills developed from childhood • Digital ink, e.g. Anoto, use a combination of ordinary ink pen with digital camera that digitally records everything written with the pen on special paper www.id-book.com The Anoto pen being used and its internal components www.id-book.com Advantages • Allows users to quickly and easily annotate existing documents • Can be used to fill in paper-based forms that can readily be convert to a digital record using standard typeface • Can be used by remote teams to communicate about and work on the same documents www.id-book.com Touchscreens • Single touchscreens are used in walk-up kiosks (such as ticket machines and ATMs) detect the presence and location of a person’s touch on the display • Multi-touch surfaces support a range of more dynamic finger tip actions, e.g. swiping, flicking, pinching, pushing and tapping • They do so by registering touches at multiple locations using a grid • Now used for many kinds of displays, such as Smartphones, iPods, tablets and tabletops – supports one and two hand gestures, including tapping, zooming, stretching, flicking, dwelling, dragging www.id-book.com A multi-touch surface www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Provides fluid and direct styles of interaction involving freehand and pen-based gestures for certain tasks • Core design concerns include whether size, orientation, and shape of touch displays effect collaboration • Much faster to scroll through wheels, carousels and bars of thumbnail images or lists of options by finger flicking • Gestures need to be learned for multi-touch so small set of gestures for common commands is preferable • More cumbersome, error-prone and slower to type using a virtual keyboard on a touch display than using a physical keyboard www.id-book.com Gesture-based systems • Gestures involve moving arms and hands to communicate • Uses camera recognition, sensor and computer vision techniques – recognize people’s arm and hand gestures in a room – gestures need to be presented sequentially to be understood (cf. the way sentences are constructed) www.id-book.com Gestures used in the operating theater www.id-book.com Recognizes core gestures for manipulating MRI or CT images using Microsoft Kinect Research and design considerations • How does computer recognize and delineate user’s gestures? – Start and end points? – Difference between deictic and hand waving • How realistic must the mirrored graphical representation of the user be in order for them to be believable? www.id-book.com Haptic interfaces • Provide tactile feedback – By applying vibration and forces to a person’s body, using actuators that are embedded in their clothing or a device they are carrying, such as a smartphone • Vibrotactile feedback can be used to simulate the sense of touch between remote people who want to communicate • Ultrahaptics creates the illusion of touch in midair using ultrasound to make the illusion of 3D shapes www.id-book.com Realtime vibrotactile feedback • Provides nudges when playing violin incorrectly • Uses motion capture to sense arm movements that deviate from model • Nudges are short vibrations on arms and hands www.id-book.com Exoskeleton with artificial muscles that uses bubble haptic feedback www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Where best to place actuators on body • Whether to use single or sequence of ‘touches’ • When to buzz and how intense • How does the wearer feel it in different contexts? • What kind of new smartphones/smartwatches apps can use vibrotactile creatively? – e.g. slow tapping to feel like water dropping that is meant to indicate it is about to rain and heavy tapping to indicate a thunderstorm is looming www.id-book.com Multimodal Interfaces • Provide enriched user experiences – by multiplying how information is experienced and detected using different modalities, i.e. touch, sight, sound, speech – support more flexible, efficient, and expressive means of human–computer interaction – most common is speech and vision • Can be combined with multi-sensor input to enable other aspects of human body to be tracked – e.g. eye gaze, facial expression, lip movements – Provides input for customizing user interfaces www.id-book.com Tracking a person’s movements www.id-book.com - Kinect camera can detect multimodal input in real time, using RGA camera for facial recognition and gestures, depth camera for movement tracking and mics for voice recognition - Used to build model of person and represented as avatar on display programmed to move just like them Research and design considerations • Need to recognize and analyse user behavior, e.g. speech, gesture, handwriting, eye gaze • Much harder to calibrate these than single modality systems • What is gained from combining different input and outputs • Is talking and gesturing, as humans do with other humans, a natural way of interacting with a computer? www.id-book.com Shareable interfaces • Designed for more than one person to use – provide multiple inputs and sometimes allow simultaneous input by co-located groups – large wall displays where people use their own pens or gestures – interactive tabletops where small groups interact with information using their fingertips e.g. DiamondTouch, Smart Table and Surface www.id-book.com A smartboard and an interactive Tabletop interface www.id-book.com Benefits • Provide a large interactional space that can support flexible group working • Can be used by multiple users – Can point to and touch information being displayed – Simultaneously view the interactions and have same shared point of reference as others • Can support more equitable participation compared with groups using single PC www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Core design concerns include whether size, orientation, and shape of the display have an effect on collaboration • Horizontal surfaces compared with vertical ones support more turn-taking and collaborative working in co-located groups • Providing larger-sized tabletops does not improve group working but encourages more division of labor • Having both personal and shared spaces enables groups to work on their own and in a group – Cross device systems have been developed to support seamless switching between these – e.g. SurfaceConstellations www.id-book.com Tangible Interfaces • Type of sensor-based interaction, where physical objects, e.g., bricks, are coupled with digital representations • When a person manipulates the physical object/s it causes a digital effect to occur, e.g. an animation • Digital effects can take place in a number of media and places or can be embedded in the physical object www.id-book.com Examples • Flow Blocks – depict changing numbers and lights embedded in the blocks – vary depending on how they are connected together • Urp – physical models of buildings moved around on tabletop – used in combination with tokens for wind and shadows -> digital shadows surrounding them to change over time • MagicCubes – Connect physical electronic components and sensors to make digital events occur (e.g. change color depending on how much shaken) www.id-book.com Learning to code and create with the tangible MagicCubes www.id-book.com Benefits • Can be held in one or both hands and combined and manipulated in ways not possible using other interfaces – allows for more than one person to explore the interface together – objects can be placed on top of each other, beside each other, and inside each other – encourages different ways of representing and exploring a problem space • People are able to see and understand situations differently – can lead to greater insight, learning, and problem-solving than with other kinds of interfaces – can facilitate creativity and reflection www.id-book.com VoxBox • A tangible system that gathers opinions at events through playful and engaging interaction (Goldsteijn et al, 2015) www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • What kinds of conceptual frameworks to use to help identify novel and specific features • What kind of coupling to use between the physical action and digital effect – If it is to support learning then an explicit mapping between action and effect is critical – If it is for entertainment then can be better to design it to be more implicit and unexpected • What kind of physical artifact to use – Bricks, cubes, and other component sets are most commonly used because of flexibility and simplicity – Stickies and cardboard tokens can also be used for placing material onto a surface • What kinds of digital outputs should tangible interfaces be combined with?

There are four family members: Sky (8 years old), Eamonn (12 years old), Claire (32), and Will (35). One evening after dinner they decide to start exploring the possibilities. They want to discuss the options together but Claire has to visit her elderly mother so will be joining the conversation from her mother’s house down the road. As a starting point, Will enters an idea they had been discussing over dinner– a sailing trip for four novices in the Mediterranean. The system supports users to log on from different locations and use different devices so that all members of the family can interact easily and comfortably with it wherever they are. The system's initial suggestion is a flotilla, where several crews (with various levels of experience) sail together on separate boats. Sky and Eamonn aren't very happy at the idea of going on vacation with a group of other people, even though the Thomsons would have their own boat. The travel organizer shows them descriptions of flotillas from other children their ages and they are all very positive, so eventually, everyone agrees to explore flotilla opportunities. Will confirms this recommendation and asks for detailed options. As it's getting late, he asks for the details to be saved so everyone can consider them tomorrow. The travel organizer emails them a summary of the different options available.” www.id-book.com 25 Scenarios • May be textual descriptions, animations, audio or video • Example animation scenarios www.id-book.com 26 Source: Keirnan et al (2015), Figure 1.

Licensed under CC-BY-3.0, (b) http://www.arch2o.com, and (c) used courtesy of Scott Hudson www.id-book.com What is a prototype? In interaction design it can be (among other things): • a series of screen sketches • a storyboard, i.e. a cartoon-like series of scenes • a Powerpoint slide show • a video simulating the use of a system • a lump of wood (e.g. PalmPilot) • a cardboard mock-up • a piece of software with limited functionality written in the target language or in another language 6www.id-book.com Why prototype? • Evaluation and feedback are central to interaction design • Stakeholders can see, hold, interact with a prototype more easily than a document or a drawing • Team members can communicate effectively • Ideas can be tested out • Prototyping encourages reflection: an important aspect of design • Prototypes answer questions, and support designers in choosing between alternatives 7 Low-fidelity Prototyping • Uses a medium which is unlike the final medium, e.g. paper, cardboard • Is quick, cheap and easily changed • Examples: – sketches of screens, task sequences, etc – ‘post-it’ notes – storyboards – ‘Wizard-of-Oz’ www.id-book.com 8www.id-book.com Storyboards • Often used with scenarios, bringing more detail, and a chance to role play • It is a series of sketches showing how a user might progress through a task using the product 9 Example storyboard www.id-book.com 10 www.id-book.com Sketching • Low-fidelity prototyping often relies on sketching • Don’t be inhibited about drawing ability. Practice simple symbols 14www.id-book.com Prototyping with index cards • Index cards (3 x 5 inches) • Each card represents one element of interaction • In evaluation, can step through the cards 15www.id-book.com ‘Wizard-of-Oz’ prototyping • The user thinks they are interacting with a computer, but a human is responding to output rather than the system. • Usually done early in design to understand users’ expectations • What is ‘wrong’ with this approach? >Blurb blurb >Do this >Why? User 13 High-fidelity prototyping • Uses materials that you would expect to be in the final product • Prototype looks more like the final system than a low-fidelity version • High-fidelity prototypes can be developed by integrating existing hardware and software components • Danger that users think they have a complete system…….see compromises www.id-book.com 14www.id-book.com Compromises in prototyping • Prototyping involve compromises • For software-based prototyping maybe there is a slow response? sketchy icons? limited functionality? • “in the wild” prototypes operational but not necessarily robust • Two common types of compromise • horizontal: provide a wide range of functions, but with little detail • vertical: provide a lot of detail for only a few functions • Compromises in prototypes must not be ignored. Product needs engineering 15 Conceptual design www.id-book.com • A conceptual model is an outline of what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand and interact with it • Understand problem space and current requirements; empathise with users • Creativity and brainstorming techniques • Mood board may be capture desired feel • Consider alternatives: scenarios and prototyping helps 16 Building scenarios www.id-book.com 17 Empathising with users www.id-book.com 18 The Third Age Suit Source: Ford Motor Co.

Design Patterns • Capture design experience: – a solution to a problem in a context – can be instantiated in many ways: generative • Patterns may be individual, in languages, in catalogues, galleries or libraries • Patterns often are associated with software components, e.g. Github or platform websites • Carousel pattern as example: www.id-book.com 14 Design Patterns www.id-book.com 15 Design Patterns • Capture design experience, but that doesn’t necessarily mean good design: – anti-patterns: don’t do it this way! – dark patterns: deliberate tricks www.id-book.com 16 Open Source Resources • Components, frameworks, systems available free of charge • Community-driven • Available for interaction design: – design pattern libraries – Bootstrap framework www.id-book.com 17 Open Source Resources www.id-book.com 18 Source: Didier Garcia/Larson Associates Tools for Interaction Design • Tools support all aspects of the design process: – creativity, sketching, simulation, brainstorming, library search, mindmapping, video capture • Tools integrate together to speed up prototyping • Tooling landscape changes all the time • Interactive wireframes or mockups can be produced using, e.g. – Moqup© – Balsamiq© – Axure© • Higher fidelity prototypes can be produced by linking interactive wireframes to design pattern library with software components www.id-book.com 19 Summary • AgileUX refers to approaches that integrate UX design and agile development – needs a balance between research and reflection, and rapid iterations – requirements are repeatedly re-prioritised, which aims to avoid wasted effort – UX design activities need careful planning: when, how much, and how to take forward • Design patterns and implementation libraries support good user experience design • Open source resources, e.g. on Github, make development of standard applications easier and quicker • A range of automated tools to support interaction design in practice is available www.id-book.com 20 Chapter 14 INTRODUCING EVALUATION The aims • Explain the key concepts and terms used in evaluation • Introduce range of different types of evaluation methods. • Show how different evaluation methods are used for different purposes at different stages of the design process and in different contexts of use. • Show how evaluators mixed and modified to meet the demands of evaluating novel systems. • Discuss some of the practical challenges of doing evaluation. • Illustrate through case studies how methods discussed in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 are used in evaluation and describe some methods that are specific to evaluation. • Provide an overview of methods that are discussed in detail in the next two chapters. www.id-book.com 2 Why, what, where and when to evaluate Iterative design & evaluation is a continuous process that examines: • Why: to check users’ requirements and that they can use the product and they like it. • What: a conceptual model, early prototypes of a new system and later, more complete prototypes and to compare it with competitors’ products. • Where: in natural, in-the wild, and laboratory settings. • When: throughout design; finished products can be evaluated to collect information to inform new products. www.id-book.com 3 Bruce Tognazzini tells you why you need to evaluate “Iterative design, with its repeating cycle of design and testing, is the only validated methodology in existence that will consistently produce successful results. If you don’t have user-testing as an integral part of your design process you are going to throw buckets of money down the drain.” See AskTog.com for topical discussions about design and evaluation. www.id-book.com 4 Types of evaluation • Controlled settings that directly involve users (eg. usability and research labs). • Natural settings involving users (eg online communities and products that are used in public places). Often there is little or no control over what users do, especially in in-the-wild settings. • Any setting that doesn’t directly involve users (eg consultants and researchers critique the prototypes, and may predict and model how successful they will be when used by users. www.id-book.com 5 Living labs • People’s use of technology in their everyday lives can be evaluated in living labs. • Such evaluations are too difficult to do in a usability lab. • An early example was the Aware Home that was embedded with a complex network of sensors and audio/video recording devices (Abowd et al., 2000). • More recent examples include whole blocks and cities that house hundreds of people, eg Verma et al’s, 2017 research in Switzerland. • Many citizen science projects can also be thought of as living labs eg iNaturalist.com • These examples illustrate how the concept of a lab is changing to include other spaces where people’s use of technology can be studied in realistic environments. www.id-book.com 6 Evaluation case studies • A classic experimental investigation into the physiological responses of players of a computer game • An ethnographic study of visitors at the the Royal Highland show in which participants are directed and tracked using a cell phone app. • Crowdsourcing in which the opinions and reactions of volunteers (ie the crowd) inform technology evaluation. www.id-book.com 7 Challenge & engagement in a collaborative immersive game • Physiological measures were used • Players were more engaged when playing against another person than when playing against a computer. • Why was the physiological data collected normalized? www.id-book.com 8 Challenge & engagement in a collaborative immersive game www.id-book.com 9 The display shows the physiological data (top right), participants and a screen of the game they played .

Reproduced with permission of ACM Publications Data collection & participants • Two studies in two hospitals involving 54 people • 13 males, 41 females • Privacy was a important concern • Hospital stay ranged from 1-7 days, mean and median age 64.6, 64.5 • Given painpad after surgery and prompted to report pain levels every two hours • Nurses also collected scores • All data entered into charts • Patients of one hospital were given a user-satisfaction survey when the left • Also rated painpad on a 1-5 Likert scale www.id-book.com 21 Data analysis & presentation • Three types of data were collected: – Satisfaction with painpad based on questionnaire responses, – Patients’ compliance with the two-hour routine, – How data collected from painpad compared with data collected by nurses. • Data showed: – Satisfaction with painpad 4.63 on Likert scale; – Patience compliance was mixed, some liked others disliked or didn’t notice the prompts; – Patients recorded more scores with Painpad than with the nurses www.id-book.com 22 Key points • Usability testing takes place in controlled usability labs or temporary labs. • Usability testing focuses on performance measures, eg. how long and how many errors are made when completing a set of predefined tasks. Indirect observation (video and keystroke logging), user satisfaction questionnaires and interviews are also collected. • Affordable, remote testing systems are more portable than usability labs. Many also contain mobile eye-tracking and other devices. • Experiments test a hypothesis by manipulating certain variables while keeping others constant. • The experimenter controls independent variable(s) in order to measure dependent variable(s). • Field studies are evaluation studies that are carried out in natural settings to discover how people interact with technology in the real world. • Field studies that involve the deployment of prototypes or technologies in natural settings may also be referred to as ‘in the wild’ studies. • Sometimes the findings of a field study are unexpected, especially for in the wild studies that explore how novel technologies are used by participants in their own homes, places of work, or outside. www.id-book.com 23 Chapter 16 Evaluation: Inspections, Analytics & Models Aims: • Describe the key concepts associated with inspection methods. • Explain how to do heuristic evaluation and walkthroughs. • Explain the role of analytics in evaluation. • Describe how A/B testing is used in evaluation. • Describe how to use Fitts’ Law – a predictive model. www.id-book.com 2 Inspections • Several kinds. • Experts use their knowledge of users & technology to review software usability. • Expert critiques can be formal or informal. • Heuristic evaluation is a review guided by a set of heuristics. • Walkthroughs involve stepping through a pre- planned scenario noting potential problems. www.id-book.com 3 Heuristic evaluation • Developed by Jacob Nielsen in the early 1990s. • Based on heuristics distilled from an empirical analysis of 249 usability problems. • These heuristics have been revised for current technology by Nielsen and others for: – mobile devices, – wearables, – virtual worlds, – social media, etc. • Design guidelines form a basis for developing heuristics. www.id-book.com 4 Revised version (2014) of Nielsen’s original heuristics • Visibility of system status. • Match between system and real world. • User control and freedom. • Consistency and standards. • Error prevention. • Recognition rather than recall. • Flexibility and efficiency of use. • Aesthetic and minimalist design. • Help users recognize, diagnose, recover from errors. • Help and documentation. www.id-book.com 5 No. of evaluators & problems www.id-book.com 6 Curve showing the proportion of usability problems in an interface found by heuristic evaluation using different numbers of evaluators. Source: Nielsen and Mack, 1994. Courtesy of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Number of evaluators • Nielsen suggests that on average 5 evaluators identify 75-80% of usability problems. • Cockton and Woolrych (2001) point out that the number of users needed to find 75-80% of usability problems depends on the context and nature of the task problems. www.id-book.com 7 Heuristics for websites focus on key criteria (Budd, 2007) • Clarity • Minimize unnecessary complexity & cognitive load • Provide users with context • Promote positive & pleasurable user experience www.id-book.com 8 Doing heuristic evaluation • Briefing session to tell experts what to do. • Evaluation period of 1-2 hours in which: – Each expert works separately; – Take one pass to get a feel for the product; – Take a second pass to focus on specific features. • Debriefing session in which experts work together to prioritize problems. www.id-book.com 9 Advantages and problems • Few ethical & practical issues to consider because users not involved. • Can be difficult & expensive to find experts. • Best experts have knowledge of application domain & users. • Biggest problems: – Important problems may get missed; – Many trivial problems are often identified – ie false alarms; – Experts have biases. www.id-book.com 10 Turning design guidelines and golden rules into heuristics Ask questions like the following: “Does the application include a visible title page, section or site? Does the user always know where they are located? Does the user always know what the system or application is doing? Are the links clearly defined? Can all actions be visualized directly (i.e., no other actions are required)?” Granollers, 2018, p. 62 www.id-book.com 11 Evaluating for accessibility using Guidelines • Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) (see Lazar et al., 2015). • Guidelines can be used as heuristics for evaluating websites. • Governments and large corporations have to make their websites accessible by law. • Four key concepts: – Perceivable; – Operable; – Understandable; – Robust. https//www.w3.org/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance www.id-book.com 12 Cognitive walkthroughs • Focus on ease of learning. • Designer presents an aspect of the design & usage scenarios. • Expert is told the assumptions about user population, context of use, task details. • One or more experts walk through the design prototype with the scenario. • Experts are guided by 3 questions. www.id-book.com 13 The 3 questions • Will the correct action be sufficiently evident to the user? • Will the user notice that the correct action is available? • Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly? As the experts work through the scenario they note problems. www.id-book.com 14 Pluralistic walkthrough • Variation on the cognitive walkthrough theme. • Performed by a carefully managed team. • The panel of experts begins by working separately. • Then there is managed discussion that leads to agreed decisions. • The approach lends itself well to participatory design. • Also other adaptations of basic cognitive walkthroughs. www.id-book.com 15 Web Analytics • A form of interaction logging that analyzes users’ activities on website. • Designers use the analysis to improve their designs. • When designs don’t meet users’ needs they will not return to the site. • They become one-time users • Web analytics enable designers to track the activities of users on their site. • They can see how many people come to the site, how long they stay and where they go. • Web analytics offer designers the “big picture” about how their site performs based on user activity. • One of the most well-know analytics. www.id-book.com 16 Segment of Google Analytics for id-book.com, December 2018 www.id-book.com 17 Segment of Google Analytics for id-book.com, December 2018 www.id-book.com 18 Segment of early VisiStat Analytics from 2010 www.id-book.com 19 Source: http//www.visistat.com/tracking/monthly-page-views.php Segment of early VisiStat Analytics from 2010 www.id-book.com 20 Where visitors to Mountain Wineries in California come from. Source: http//www.visistat.com/tracking/monthly-page-views.php A/B Testing • A large-scale experiment. • Offers another way to evaluate a website, application of app running on a mobile device. • Often used for evaluating changes in design on social media applications. • Compares how two groups of users perform on two versions of a design. • Can involve thousands of users. • May create ethical dilemmas if users don’t know they are part of the test. • Care is needed to ensure that other issues are not affecting users’ behavior. www.id-book.com 21 Predictive models • Provide a way of evaluating products or designs without directly involving users. • Less expensive than user testing. • Usefulness limited to systems with predictable tasks - e.g., telephone answering systems, mobiles, cell and smart phones. • Based on expert error-free behavior. www.id-book.com 22 Fitts’ Law (Fitts, 1954) • Fitts’ Law predicts that the time to point at an object using a device is a function of the distance from the target object & the object’s size. • The further away and the smaller the object, the longer the time to locate it and point to it. • Particularly useful for determining where on a screen to position an object. • Fitts’ Law is useful for evaluating systems for which the time to locate an object is important, e.g., a cell and smart phones, a handheld and mobile devices. www.id-book.com 23 Key points • Inspections can be used to evaluate requirements, mockups, functional prototypes, or systems. • User testing & heuristic evaluation may reveal different usability problems. • Design guidelines can be used to develop heuristics. • Walkthroughs are fine-grained focused method for evaluating small parts of a product. • Analytics involves collecting data about users activity on a website or product to see which parts are used. • A/B testing a form of large-scale experiment. • Fitts’ Law can be used to predict expert, error-free performance for clearly defined tasks with limited key presses, eg to evaluate keypress sequences for handheld devices and the position of objects on a screen. www.id-book.com 24","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
