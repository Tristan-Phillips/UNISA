We hope that you will find the module interesting and stimulating. You are most welcome to contact your lecturers for any academic queries regarding the module – see sections 3.1 and 3.2 below. (See section 3.3 for information regarding other kinds of queries.) This tutorial letter contains general information about COS3761: we discuss the tutorial matter, student support, the syllabus, the requirements for examination admission, the semester mark and how to submit assignments. In addition, this tut letter contains Assignments 1, 2 and 3, first for the first semester and then for the second semester as well. Some quick facts about the three assignments:  You must submit at least one assignment to get examination admission.  The three assignments contribute towards your semester mark, which counts 20% of your final mark. 2 PURPOSE AND OUTCOMES OF THE MODULE 2.1 PURPOSE The purpose of studying logic is to refine one’s natural ability to reason and argue. Logic is concerned with training the mind to think clearly. The aim of logic is to obtain clarity in the definition and arrangement of our ideas and other mental images, consistency in our judgements, and validity in our processes of inference. Logic is about representing knowledge in a precise language so that a computer can reason about it, i.e. so that an algorithm can be defined to make valid deductions from the knowledge. Logic is applied extensively in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science and Philosophy, and this module aims to provide a solid foundation for these studies. 2.2 OUTCOMES At the end of this module you should have obtained strategies for thinking effectively, know about the common errors in reasoning which should be avoided and have developed effective techniques for evaluating arguments. You should know some of the logic languages used to represent knowledge, and understand some of the computer algorithms used to reason about the knowledge represented in such languages. Abbreviated syllabus: o propositional logic – declarative sentences, natural deduction, semantics, normal forms o predicate logic – syntax, natural deduction, semantics, undecidability o modal logics – syntax, semantics, logic engineering, natural deduction, multi-agent systems 3 LECTURER AND CONTACT DETAILS 3.1 LECTURERS The names and contact details of the lecturers for COS3761 are specified in Tutorial Letter COSALLF/301/4/2018 COS3761/101/3/2018 4 . Students may contact lecturers by mail, e-mail or telephone. We recommend the use of e-mail. Students may make appointments to see a lecturer, but this has to be done well in advance. Students should mention their student numbers in all communications with the lecturers. 3.2 DEPARTMENT If you have not yet received the contact details of your lecturer and would like to speak to him or her, you may contact the secretary of the School of Computing. Remember to mention your student number. This is for academic queries only. Please do not contact the School about missing tutorial matter, cancellation of a module, payments, enquiries about the registration of assignments, and so on, but rather the relevant department as indicated in the brochure my Studies @ Unisa. 3.3 UNIVERSITY The brochure my Studies @ Unisa (that you should have received with your tutorial matter) contains information about computer laboratories, the library, myUnisa, assistance with study skills and so on. It also contains contact details of several Unisa departments, for example Examinations, Assignments, Despatch, Finances and Student Administration. Remember to mention your student number when contacting the University. 4 MODULE RELATED RESOURCES 4.1 TUTORIAL MATTER The prescribed book (see section 4.2) is essential study material, as are the tutorial letters that you will receive during the course of the semester. Tutorial Letter 101 (this tutorial letter) is the most important document in terms of specifying the scope of this module, and what you need to do complete it successfully. Additional notes are available in Additional Resources on myUnisa. They are meant to help you to master the material in the prescribed book. They explain some of the concepts in more detail, and give additional examples, etc. They are intended to be used together with the prescribed book. The 200 series tutorial letters (Tutorial Letters 201, 202 and 203) will discuss the assignments. These will be made available on myUnisa after the respective due dates of the assignments. Only Tut Letter 101 will be printed and sent to you. All other tutorial matter (besides the prescribed book) will only be available in electronic form on myUnisa. One of the requirements for study in the School of Computing is to have regular access to myUnisa because you are expected to use it for your studies. When you attempt to use this facility for the first time, you have to register. Go to my.unisa.ac.za and click on “Claim UNISA login”. Then follow the instructions on the screen. You will be given a password for future use. To download study material from myUnisa, log in to myUnisa using your student number and password and choose COS3761. Tut Letter 101 is available in Official Study Material (in the menu on the left), and Tut Letters 201, 202 and 203 will be available in Additional Resources. All other tutorial matter will be available in Learning Units or in Additional Resources. COS3761/101/3/2018 5 4.2 PRESCRIBED BOOK The prescribed book for this course is Huth, M & Ryan, M. 2005. Logic in computer science: modelling and reasoning about systems. 2nd edition. United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press. We cover chapters 1, 2 and 5 of the prescribed book in this module. Not all the sections of these chapters are prescribed, though. The following list specifies which sections of the prescribed chapters are for examination purposes, and which you may read for interest's sake: Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5.1 and 1.5.3 Sections 1.5.2 and 1.6 Examination purposes Read only Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2,5 Theorem 2.22 and Section 2.6 Section 2.7 Examination purposes Read only Leave out Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5.1 and 5.5.2 Sections 5.5.3 and 5.5.4 Examination purposes Read only You have to purchase a copy of the prescribed book yourself at any of the official booksellers mentioned in the brochure my Studies @ Unisa. If you have any difficulties obtaining a copy of the prescribed book from these bookshops, please contact the Unisa Prescribed Book Section as soon as possible. 4.3 LEARNING UNITS ON MYUNISA Three learning units are provided on the COS3761 website on myUnisa, one for each assignment. They are intended to give guidance on how to work through the tutorial matter for each assignment. They also provide some hints on how to tackle and answer the assignments. 4.4 MO001 TUTORIAL LETTER There is an additional tutorial letter MO001 available in Additional Resources on the myUnisa website for COS3761. It is a collection of many of the other resources available on the COS3761 website in one document. For example, it contains the three learning units, as well as the list of errata in the prescribed book, the additional notes for the three prescribed chapters, and solutions to selected exercises. The reason why these resources are duplicated and collected together in this single tutorial letter is to allow students who do not have regular access to the internet to use this single document in place of the individual resources. Some students (who do have regular access to the internet) prefer to work from a limited number of documents, rather than from multiple individual ones. MO001 attempts to address this preference. 5 STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE MODULE Important information appears in the brochure my Studies @ Unisa. The Student Services Bureau of Unisa provides support for students in general academic matters, such as selecting appropriate modules, developing study skills, adapting to distance education and general difficulties with studies. Although we, the COS3761 lecturers, do not take active part in the discussion forums on myUnisa, we would like to encourage you to join your fellow students there. You may also organise your own study group. However, we expect every member of a study group to write and submit the assignments on his or her own. Thus, discuss problems and find COS3761/101/3/2018 6 solutions together as a group, but then do the assignment yourself and submit your own work. It is dishonest to pass off the work of somebody else as your own. Plagiarism is the act of taking the words, ideas and thoughts of others and passing them off as your own. It is a form of theft which involves a number of dishonest academic activities. The Disciplinary Code for Students (2004) is given to all students at registration. You are advised to study the Code, especially sections 2.1.13 and 2.1.14 (2004:3–4). Kindly read the University’s Policy on Copyright Infringement and Plagiarism as well. 5.1 STUDENTS WHO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO THE INTERNET Although all modules in the School of Computing require students to have access to the internet, we realise that there are some students who only have limited access. To try to make it easier for such students to study COS3761, we have made the following arrangements:  All COS3761 tutorial matter available on myUnisa, except the solutions to assignments in Tutorial Letters 201, 202 and 203, are collected together into a single document MO001. (See section 4.4.) As far as we know, this tutorial letter will be printed and sent to all students. In any case, it is available for download in Additional Resources on myUnisa. Such students also have to download Tutorial Letters 201, 202 and 203 when they are available.  Students can submit assignments by post instead of myUnisa. (See section 7.4.1.) Unfortunately, such assignments will not be returned by post because marked assignments have to be downloaded from myUnisa. 6 MODULE SPECIFIC STUDY PLAN Use the brochure my Studies @ Unisa for general time management and planning skills. The due dates for assignments are given in section 7.3 below. The learning units for COS3761 on myUnisa give directions for working though the relevant sections of the prescribed book and the other resources, and what to do in preparation for the assignments and the exam. 7 ASSESSMENT 7.1 ASSESSMENT PLAN The marks that you obtain for Assignments 1, 2 and 3 form the semester mark for COS3761. The semester mark forms 20% and the examination 80% of the final mark for the module. The weights of the COS3761 assignments are indicated in the table below. Assignment Weight 1 30% 2 40% 3 30% Example: Suppose a student gets 60% for Assignment 1, 45% for Assignment 2 and doesn't submit Assignment 3. In order to calculate the contribution to the semester mark, the mark obtained for each assignment is multiplied by the weight. This then forms part of the 20% that the semester mark contributes to the final mark. Therefore: COS3761/101/3/2018 7 Assignment Marks obtained Weight Contribution to semester mark 1 60% 30% 60/100 x 30/100 x 20 3.6 2 45% 40% 45/100 x 40/100 x 20 3.6 3 0% 30% 0/100 x 30/100 x 20 0.0 Total 7.2 In this example, the student has a semester mark of 7.0 out of a possible 20. Note that the semester mark does not form part of the final mark of a supplementary examination. 7.2 ASSIGNMENT NUMBERS Every assignment has a general assignment number and a unique assignment number. Semester General assignment number Unique assignment number Due date 1 1 765814 21 February 2018 2 873176 28 March 2018 3 809076 25 April 2018 2 1 745876 08 August 2018 2 855673 12 September 2018 3 753314 05 October 2018 7.3 DUE DATES The due dates of assignments are given in the table in section 7.2 above. Please note, no extension of the due dates is possible. 7.4 SUBMISSION OF ASSIGNMENTS Doing the assignments is extremely important for mastering the study material. We strongly advise you to complete and submit all three assignments. The three assignments for both the first and second semesters are given in section 8 of this tutorial letter. The tutorial matter that should be studied for each assignment appears at the start of each assignment. When submitting your assignments, follow the guidelines given in this tutorial letter, in Tutorial Letter COSALLF/301/4/2016 and in the brochure my Studies @ Unisa.  Assignment 1 is a multiple-choice assignment and should be submitted electronically through myUnisa. No extension will be granted for this assignment. In other words, it must be submitted by the due date. COS3761/101/3/2018 8  Assignment 2 is a written assignment and should be submitted electronically as a PDF file through myUnisa. The semester system does not allow for the late submission of this assignment.  Assignment 3 is a multiple-choice assignment and should be submitted electronically through myUnisa. No extension will be granted for this assignment. If myUnisa is offline when you want to submit an assignment, you need not contact us because we will be aware of it. Simply submit it as soon as myUnisa is available again. It is a good idea to check whether your assignment has been registered on the system after you have submitted it. If it hasn't, there was a problem with capturing your answers, or with uploading your assignment file. You must either attempt to submit the assignment again, or contact the lecturers to address the problem. For detailed information on assignments and their submission, please refer to the brochure my Studies @ Unisa, which you received with your study package. To submit an assignment via myUnisa:  Go to myUnisa.  Log in with your student number and password.  Select the module.  Click on “Assignments” in the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.  Click on the assignment number you wish to submit.  Follow the instructions. 7.5 SUBMISSION BY POST As stated in section 5.1, we are aware that there are students who do not have regular access to the internet but who want to submit their assignments. Such students can follow this procedure: Multiple-choice assignments:  Fill in your answers to the questions on a mark-reading sheet.  Submit it as explained in the brochure my Studies @ Unisa. Written assignments:  Type a document with your answers to the questions, print it out and staple it in an assignment cover.  Submit the assignment as explained in the brochure my Studies @ Unisa. Please note that if you submit any of your assignments in one of the above ways, it will take time for your assignment to reach Unisa. You must ensure that your assignment is posted in time to be received and recorded on the assignment database by the due date. Also, you will not receive your marked assignment back in printed form. Unfortunately all feedback on assignments is electronic. For example, if you submit a written document by post, the first thing the Assignment Department will do when they receive your assignment will be to scan it. This electronic version will be sent to us for marking, and will be marked electronically like all other assignments submitted via myUnisa. It will also be returned via myUnisa. If you don't have access to the internet, you will have to get someone to check your myLife account for the COS3761/101/3/2018 9 notice that your assignment has been marked, or check for you on myUnisa. They will have to download your marked assignment for you. 8 ASSIGNMENTS: Section 8.1 THE ASSIGNMENTS OF THE FIRST SEMESTER 2018 ASSIGNMENT 1 FIRST SEMESTER (MULTIPLE CHOICE) SUBMISSION: On multiple choice form or electronically through myUnisa Please note that Assignment 1 has to be submitted in order to gain examination admission. It will be to your own advantage to check whether the assignment has been registered on the system after a few days. If you want to submit the assignment electronically and myUnisa is off-line during that time, you need not contact us, because we will be aware of it. Simply submit it as soon as myUnisa is available again. DUE DATE EXTENSION TUTORIAL MATTER WEIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION TO SEMESTER MARK UNIQUE NUMBER QUESTIONS 21 February 2018 No extension will be granted for Assignment 1.

QUESTION 6 If we interpret □  as \"It ought to be that  \", which of the following formulas correctly expresses the English sentence It ought to be that if I will get a gold medal then I it is permitted that I will get a gold medal. where p stands for the declarative sentence \"I will get a gold medal\"? Option 1: □ (p ¬ □ ¬ p) Option 2: □( p ¬ ◊ p) Option 3: □ p  ◊ ¬ p Option 4: □ p  □ p Option 5: It is impossible to translate this sentence into a formula of modal logic with the required interpretation. QUESTION 7 If we interpret □  as \"It is necessarily true that  \", why should the formula scheme □   □ □  hold in this modality? COS3761/101/3/2018 29 Option 1: Because for all formulas , it is necessarily true that if  then . Option 2: Because for all formulas , if  is necessarily true, then it is necessary that it is necessarily true. Option 3: Because for all formulas , if  is not possibly true, then it is true. Option 4: Because for all formulas ,  is necessarily true if it is true. Option 5: □   □ □  should not hold in this modality QUESTION 8 If we interpret □  as \"After any execution of program P,  holds\", why should the formula scheme □   ◊  not hold in this modality? Option 1: Because it is not the case that if  holds after every execution P, then  does not hold after some execution of P. Option 2: Because for a program P that never executes correctly, there is no execution of P after which  holds. Option 3: Because even if there is some execution of P after which  does not hold, it doesn't mean that  does not hold after any execution of P. Option 4: Because there may be a program P such that even though  holds after every execution P,  does not hold after some execution. Option 5: □   ◊  should hold in this modality, because if  holds after every execution of P, it should hold after at least one execution of P. QUESTION 9 If we interpret □  as \"Always in the future (where the future does not include the present) it will be true that  \", which of the following formulas should be valid? Option 1: □ p  p Option 2: □ p  □ □ p Option 3: □ p  ◊ p Option 4: □ p  □ ¬ p Option 5: All of these formulas should hold in this modality. COS3761/101/3/2018 30 QUESTION 10 If we interpret □  as \"Agent A believes  \", what is the English translation of the formula □ p  □ ◊ q? Option 1: If agent A believes p then agent B believes not q. Option 2: If agent A believes p then he believes that agent B does not believe q. Option 3: If agent A believes p then he believes that he does not believe q. Option 4: Agent A believes p and he believes that agent B believes not q. Option 5: Agent A believes p but he doesn't believe q. QUESTION 11 If we interpret □  as \"Agent A believes  \", what formula will be correctly translated to English as If agent A believes p then he believes not q Option 1: □ p  □ ¬ q Option 2: □ (p  ¬ q) Option 3: □ p  ◊ q Option 4: □ p  ◊ ¬ q Option 5: ◊ (¬ p  ¬ q) QUESTION 12 If we interpret Kᵢ as agent I knows , the formula scheme ¬  K₁ ¬ K₁  means Option 1: If  is true then agent 1 knows that he does not know  Option 2: If  is false then agent 1 knows that he does not know  Option 3: If  is true then agent 1 knows that he knows  Option 4: If  is false then agent 1 knows that he knows  Option 5: None of the above is correct COS3761/101/3/2018 31 The following natural deduction proof (without reasons) is referred to in Questions 13, 14 and 15: 1 ¬ □ ¬ (p  q) premise 2 □ p 3 □ ¬ q 4 p  q assumption 5 p □ e 2 6 q  e 4, 5 7 ¬ q □ e 3 8  ¬ e 6, 7 9 ¬ (p  q) ¬ i 4 - 8 10 □ ¬ (p  q) □ i 4 - 9 11  ¬ e 10, 1 12 ¬ □ ¬ q ¬ i 3 - 11 13 □ p  ¬ □ ¬  i 2 – 12 QUESTION 13 How many times are □ elimination and introduction rules used in the above proof?

QUESTION 7 If we interpret □  as \"It is necessarily true that  \", why should the formula scheme □    hold in this modality? Option 1: Because for all formulas , it is necessarily true that if  then . Option 2: Because for all formulas , if  is necessarily true, then it is true.

Option 1: Just because  holds after every execution of P doesn't necessarily mean that  holds before execution of P. Option 2: Because it is not that case that after any execution of P, if  holds then  holds. Option 3: Because if  does not hold before execution of P, it doesn't necessarily mean that  holds after any execution of P.
