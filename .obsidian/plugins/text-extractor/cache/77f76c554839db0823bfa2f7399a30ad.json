WELCOME TO THE SCHOOL OF COMPUTING We welcome you as a registered student in the School of Computing and wish you a successful year of study. The purpose of this tutorial letter is to provide you with general information regarding the modules offered by the school as well as the names and contact details of your lecturers. To avoid unnecessary duplication, general information applicable to all the modules may not be repeated in the study material for each module. Module specific information including assignments is either included in Tutorial Letter 101 or myUnisa or both. You can find links to myUnisa and the Unisa library on the web page of Unisa (www.unisa.ac.za). General information about assignments, examinations and booksellers can be found on myUnisa. 2. CONTACTING WITH THE UNIVERSITY Visit www.unisa.ac.za and follow the link Contact us (http://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/corporate/default/Contact-us) to obtain information on how to contact the University. Information about Unisa’s regional centers is also listed here. 2.1. DIGITAL ACCESS CENTRES Unisa has entered into partnerships with establishments in various locations across South Africa to enable Unisa students free access to computers and the Internet. This access enables you to conduct the following academic related activities: registration; online submission of assignments; engaging in e-tutoring activities and signature courses, etc. Please note that any other activity outside of these is for your own cost, for example, printing, photocopying, etc. For more information on the digital access centre nearest to you, please visit http://my.unisa.ac.za/ and select menu Student Support & Regions from which you choose the link Tuition Support (https://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/myunisa/default/Learner-support-&-regions/Tuition-Support/Digital-Access- Centres). The page that is loaded when choosing Tuition Support, has two links on the left panel. Select Digital Access Centres for more information on digital access centres. 3. COMMUNICATION WITH THE SCHOOL OF COMPUTING The home page of the School of Computing is http://osprey.unisa.ac.za/. Please do not phone the School of Computing regarding non-academic matters. For non-academic queries see Section 2 of this tutorial letter (previous Section). A general e-mail address computing@unisa.ac.za is available for the school. Use this e-mail address when you have a general query regarding the School of Computing. 4. COMMUNICATION WITH THE LECTURERS 4.1. E-MAIL (RECOMMENDED) If you have a problem regarding any aspect relating to the content of your modules, you can address it to the specific module e-mail address that is provided on myUnisa. Always provide the student number in your e-mail. Please use these addresses on myUnisa and not your lecturers' individual addresses (unless you are specifically asked to do so). SOCALL0/301 5 4.2. TELEPHONIC Section 7 of this tutorial letter lists all the modules, lecturers for the modules, their telephone numbers and their office numbers. As a general guideline you should first check if your lecturer is available for telephonic queries at a given time – see Section 6.2 on how to check if your lecturer is available for telephonic query. If you cannot get hold of one of the lecturers on the specific module, leave a voice mail or you may leave a message with one of the secretaries at 011 670 9715 for the Computer Science department or 011 670 9188 for the Information Systems department – please refer to Section 7 to establish if your module is offered by which department). When leaving a message clearly indicate your name, student number and telephone number. The lecturer will contact you as soon as possible. 4.3. APPOINTMENTS We would like to help you as much as we can, but you must make an appointment beforehand if you wish to see us personally. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it may not be possible to meet you physically. However, academics can arrange an electronic meeting with you. 4.4. EUP1501 All communication to the EUP1501 module should be directed to one of the following e-mail addresses: Eup1501queries@unisa.ac.za For EUP1501 general enquiries EUP1501myitlab@unisa.ac.za For myITLab queries We prefer e-mails as a way to communicate with the EUP1501 support team but if you cannot then you may call the following numbers between 08:00 and 16:00 weekdays only. Telephone number: 011 670 9140 or 011 670 9142 5. COMMUNICATING WITH TEACHING ASSISTANTS AND E-TUTORS If you are an EUP1501 student, you will be grouped and allocated a teaching assistant. You will be informed via your myLife e-mail about your group allocation and your teaching assistant. All students registered for first level, second level and third level modules other than EUP1501, should be assigned to an e-tutor in their respective modules. You will be informed of your e-tutor during the year. 6. COMMUNICATING ON THE INTERNET The Internet provides an alternative means of communication with the administrative sections of Unisa, with your lecturers and with other students. It is a useful way to obtain information, get assistance from your lecturers and keep in touch with your fellow students. The Internet facilities which are currently available are as follows: 6.1. THE MYUNISA WEB SERVER For study at the School of Computing you need to have regular access to myUnisa, UNISA’s official web based self- service portal. The URL for myUnisa is http://my.unisa.ac.za/. SOCALL0/301 6 This system, for example, can be used to  submit assignments electronically (multiple choice as well as other kinds of assignment). Consult myUnisa for the format of your assignments and submission procedure.  check assignment due dates;  track assignments to see whether or not they have been received, registered and correctly uploaded. It is your responsibility to make sure that your assignment reaches Unisa.  find out if an assignment has been marked;  find out what marks have been awarded for a specific assignment;  download study material.  read module announcements;  view prescribed books;  find names of fellow students who have chosen to share their contact details with the rest of the class;  find provisional and final examination dates;  take part in discussions on the forums. Some modules offered by the School are fully online. If you are registered for such an online module, you will be expected to make use of myUnisa more extensively than explained above and you will not be receiving any printed study material. 6.1.1 Join myLife and myUnisa Go to http://my.unisa.ac.za/, then click on Claim Unisa Login on the top right of the Web page. Follow the steps. The final page will display your myLife e-mail address and your initial Unisa password which is for both the myLife and myUnisa systems. Your initial Unisa password will also be sent to the cell phone number displayed on the page for safekeeping. Watch the short video clip on how to access your myLife e-mail account and login to myUnisa: http://podcasts.unisa.ac.za/library/attachments/F499D73D-6B03-42CE-B061-3FA7346C6F13/6EF8773F-E925-430E- 8FE2-7697F1239F5E.m4v Problems or queries regarding your myUnisa password, should be e-mailed to myUnisaHelp@unisa.ac.za or MyLifeHelp@unisa.ac.za or phone 012 429 3111. 6.1.2 NEW myUnisa myUnisa is using Moodle, a learning management platform, from 2022. You will notice that the look and feel of your module sites are different from the module sites of previous years. You can obtain basic skills in using Moodle by visiting https://dtls-qa.unisa.ac.za/course/view.php?id=32130 6.2. THE OSPREY WEB SERVER The School of Computing has its own web server. The URL is http://osprey.unisa.ac.za/. To access the services listed below, you have to personalize the Registered students page for your modules. To do this select the modules you have registered for in the list given on the right hand side and click the submit button. SOCALL0/301 7 This page uses cookies to store your preferences, so make sure that the security settings on your browser allow you to store cookies. Similarly, if you want to change your preferences, you will have to delete the cookies (click on the Re-personalize page on the Registered Students page). After personalizing the Web page, you can access the staff availability page and the software disk. The staff availability page (see an example screenshot below) indicates which of your lecturers are unavailable, attending meetings or available for telephonic queries. Note that when a lecturer is available, it does not necessarily mean that the lecturer is in the office at that moment. It means that they are \"around\", and that you should try later if your call is not answered. 7. NAMES AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS OF YOUR LECTURERS Given below is the list of modules, lecturers for the modules, office numbers and their telephone numbers. Due to numerous staff members leaving and new members joining the school, it is advised that you check the module myUnisa page to get information on the current lecturers in a module. Before you call a lecturer it is recommended that you first check if the lecturer is available via the staff availability page on Osprey as explained in Section 6.2. If you cannot get hold of the lecturer on the specific module leave a voice message or contact the secretaries (see Section 4.2).

The Adobe Reader should be loaded on your computer so that you can view or print scanned PDF documents. This can be downloaded free of charge from http://www.adobe.com. E-reserves can be downloaded from the Library catalogue. More information is available at: https://libguides.unisa.ac.za/request/request Electronic journals Most of the journals in the Unisa Library are available electronically. This means that you can print or download journal articles from your computer rather than requesting them from the library. You will need to install the Adobe Acrobat Reader on your computer in order to view and print full text articles. There are two ways of finding out whether a journal is available electronically:  via Find e-journals on the library’s homepage http://www.unisa.ac.za, click on Library, Find e-journals and type in the journal title. A link will be provided if electronic access is available. It is strongly recommended that you use this valuable resource frequently.  via the catalogue http://oasis.unisa.ac.za, click on Journal title under the Search Options tab and type in the journal title. If access is available, a View full text … link will appear. Click on it to start searching. E-Journals Libguide: https://libguides.unisa.ac.za/ejournals 9.3. USING THE UNISA LIBRARY CATALOGUE You can search for books on the catalogue by author, title, keyword or subject. SOCALL0/301 13  Author Type the author’s last name first followed by the initial or the full name e.g. Clingman S or Clingman Stephen  Title Type as much or as little of the title as you like e.g. Ethics and experience: moral theory from just war to abortion or Ethics and experience  Keyword Keywords use free language or exact phrases and can be used when you are unsure of a title. Remember that keywords can retrieve a large number of results because the whole record is searched e.g. ‘global warming’ or ‘diversity management’.  Advanced keyword This allows you to select the fields in which your keywords must occur e.g. a simultaneous search in the author and title fields. To access the advanced keyword search, click on Search options on the catalogue’s homepage and select Advanced keyword.  Subject Subject headings assist you to find material that focuses on a particular topic. The library uses the Library of Congress’s predetermined terms. If you do not know the correct Library of Congress Subject Heading, rather perform a keyword or title search to find at least one relevant title on your topic. Use the full display of that record to find the appropriate subject heading(s). You can also search for journal titles on the catalogue but remember that this search does not give you the titles of articles. Accessing the Library Catalogue on your cell phone SOCALL0/301 14 9.4. LIBGUIDES These subject guides have been compiled by librarians to help you find resources to use to find information on your topic. To access them, go to the http://libguides.unisa.ac.za. You can then select the relevant subject guide from the list provided. The subject guides are divided according to types of material shown in the tabs at the top of the subject guide. These subject guides give you access to the many online subject databases available in your field of research. Many of these databases contain full text books and articles which can be viewed, printed and downloaded. Remember that off-campus access will require your student number and myUnisa password. Important: It is recommended that you also download browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox and make use of them in the event that you get an error message.

Requests will be attended to on a first-come, first-served basis. 9.8. REFERENCING Reference Techniques It is very important to find out which reference technique and bibliographic style your department prefers and to use them consistently throughout your dissertation. The most commonly used are the Harvard, the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Modern Languages Association (MLA) methods. Managing your references Many software tools are available to help students and researchers collate and manage citations and references, e.g. RefWorks, Mendeley, Endnote and Zotero. The University subscribes to Mendeley and RefWorks. Refer to the Unisa Reference Management Tools Libguide: https://libguides.unisa.ac.za/reference_management_tools. RefWorks is a web-based bibliographic citation manager that allows you to collect, save and organize bibliographic citations for journal articles, books, web sites and other sources that you have found during your research. With it you can create correctly-formatted bibliographies in your preferred style. This service is available free of charge to all Unisa students and is accessible both on and off campus.

All postgraduate students (incl Honours) can submit their work directly to Turnitin. Students are automatically given access to Turnitin once their respective supervisors/lecturers are registered. All queries regarding the use of Turnitin can be emailed to Turnitin@unisa.ac.za. 10. TUTORIAL MATTER In addition to general tutorial letters like this one, the tutorial matter for every module that is not completely online consists of tutorial letters specifically meant for that module, as well as a prescribed book, a study guide where applicable, and possibly also recommended books and additional reference material. Specific software might also be SOCALL0/301 18 part of the tutorial matter. How to acquire the prescribed book, study guide, recommended books, additional reference material and software is explained in Tutorial Letter 101 of the module. If your module is online, use myUnisa specifically the Lessons to obtain more information about the module study material. Software is required in some modules. In some cases, it will be provided to you on a DVD as part of your study package and in other cases you will have to acquire it yourself. Full details are given in Tutorial Letter 101 or Lessons on myUnisa of the relevant module. If it is indicated that you should use software that is provided on a DVD and if you, for any reason whatsoever, do not receive the DVD in your study package, you need to download the software on the DVD from osprey (refer to Section 6.2 in this tutorial letter). You may, for example, copy the software onto a memory stick (flash disk) and install it from there onto your computer. 11. ASSIGNMENTS 11.1. THE PURPOSE OF ASSIGNMENTS Although examination admission and the semester or year mark for a module are determined by assignments, this is not their main purpose. We consider the completion of assignments an essential part of the educational and learning process. By doing an assignment you get the opportunity to determine your own understanding of the tutorial matter and we get the chance to ascertain whether your knowledge and understanding are adequate (in order to be able to give you better guidance). Since Unisa is an Open Distance Learning University, we have no other way to attain this goal. Assignments are therefore primarily intended to help you to understand the tutorial matter. Some modules use assignments to ascertain whether or not you are able to apply the theory because examination questions may be more theoretical. The purpose of assignments is not achieved when you do not submit your own work. For this reason, lecturers are strict about due dates. The solutions are sent out after those dates. 11.2. STUDYING IN GROUPS You are welcome to work together in small groups. This can be very useful and stimulating, and may result in greater enjoyment of your studies as compared with studying in isolation. You may phone the University to obtain the names of other students in your area. Refer to Tutorial Letter 101/myUnisa of the relevant module: some lecturers may expect you to list the names and student numbers of the members if you work in groups. We expect, however, that each member of the group to do his or her own assignments and will write and submit his or her own programs. The purpose of assignments, as explained above, is not achieved when you do not submit your own work. So, discuss problems, find solutions, etc., in the group but then do the assignments yourself. It is dishonest and unethical to submit the work of somebody else as your own. 11.3. PLAGIARISM Plagiarism is the act of taking words, ideas and thoughts of others and passing them off as your own. It is a form of theft which involves a number of dishonest activities (see www.unisa.ac.za > Register > Student policies & rules > Policy for Copyright Infringement and Plaigarism.pdf). Please refer to Student Disciplinary Code available at www.unisa.ac.za > Register > Student policies & rules > Student’s Disciplinary Code.pdf SOCALL0/301 19 (https://www.unisa.ac.za/static/corporate_web/Content/Apply%20for%20admission/Documents/Policy_copyright_i nfringement_plagiarism_16November2005.pdf). N.B.: Note that copyright exists on Unisa tutorial matter. You are, for example, not allowed to use any Unisa solutions when you do assignments. 11.4. EXAMINATION ADMISSION You will find information about the list of criteria for examination admission in Tutorial Letter 101/MO001 or on myUnisa of the relevant module. The following is also important:  Please make note of your examination dates and arrange with your employer for leave in good time.  Make sure that there are no clashes on your examination timetable. Contact the department of Student Administration if clashes do occur. 11.5. SEMESTER / YEAR MARK The marks that you obtain by submitting assignments will contribute to the final mark obtained for a specific module. For most modules the marks that you obtain for the contributing assignments will be converted to form 20% of the final mark for the module. This is the ‘semester mark’ or ‘year mark’. The weight of the contribution of every assignment to the semester or year mark differs from assignment to assignment and from module to module. In some cases, the assignments have identical weights and in other modules not. You will find the details in Tutorial Letter 101 or on myUnisa of a specific module. An example: Suppose a specific module has 4 assignments with weights of 20%, 25%, 25% and 30%, respectively. Now suppose that your marks for the four assignments are 20%, 80%, 60% and 50%, respectively. Your semester/year mark will be calculated as follows: (0.20 x 0.20) + (0.80 x 0.25) + (0.60 x 0.25) + (0.50 x 0.30). This gives us 0.04 + 0.2 + 0.15 + 0.15 = 0.54. Thus your semester or year mark is equal to 54%. If we convert this to 20% of your final mark, it will be 10.8%. It should be clear that it is to your advantage to complete and submit as many assignments as possible and to do your best in every one of them. N.B.: For most of the modules, the year mark only contributes if you obtain 40% or more for the examination. Please note that in general the year mark or semester mark is not considered for supplementary exams but for aegrotat exams. 11.6. DOING AND SUBMITTING ASSIGNMENTS We are aware of the very difficult conditions under which many students study, and that unforeseen circumstances may occur. We therefore advise you to start your studies well in advance, after carefully planning the time you have SOCALL0/301 20 available for studying, to suit your circumstances. This planning should be done using the due dates of the assignments as a guideline. Due dates for all assignments are specified in Tutorial Letter 101 or on myUnisa of every module. Please note that it is your responsibility to make sure that your assignments reach the University. You may check this by using myUnisa. We try to mark assignments within 4 weeks of the due date. Please make enquiries if you have not yet received a mark six weeks after the due date. Assignments may not be sent directly to the School of Computing since every assignment must first be registered at the Assignment section. Remember that your assignment must have precisely the same number as the one specified in Tutorial Letter 101, or on myUnisa of the module. Even though Assignment 2 may be the first assignment done by you, it must be numbered 02 and not 01. Consult myUnisa for detailed information regarding the submission of assignments. Electronically submitted assignments should be in one of the formats specified on myUnisa. If such an assignment contains diagrams and figures, we recommend that you convert it to PDF format before you upload it to myUnisa. You must submit your assignments electronically via myUnisa. EXTENSION OF DUE DATES In some cases, the due date of an assignment may be extended. Every module has its own procedure for this. Sometimes it is impossible to extend a due date, sometimes an assignment may be submitted a certain number of days after the due date as long as a note is included, sometimes a lecturer has to be contacted, et cetera. The information is given in Tutorial Letter 101 or on myUnisa of a specific module. 11.7. ASSIGNMENT REMARK AND RECHECK A student is welcome to query his/her assignment marks with the primary lecturer, via email, within 14 calendar days from the date that the marked assignment is released to the student. 11.8. PRACTICAL WORK MANY of the modules offered in the School of Computing include a practical component. It is important to recognise the value of the practical assignments. Practical work takes up a great deal of time and you must, therefore, start doing it early. If you do not have access to a computer, it might be possible to use the facilities at one of Unisa’s computer laboratories (see Section 2). You will need software for the practical work. In some cases, you have to buy the software yourself and in other cases it is supplied on a CD as part of your study package. Information regarding this can be found in Tutorial Letter 101 or on myUnisa of the relevant module. NOTE: It is unlikely that you will be able to pass the examination of a programming module unless you have completed the practical assignments during the year. SOCALL0/301 21 12. EXAMINATIONS DEMARCATION OR SCOPING OF EXAMINATIONS Lecturers are not allowed to inform students which parts of the module content are examinable and, which parts are non-examinable. Thus students should be prepared to answer questions that test any aspect included in the syllabus of a module. 13. COMPUTER-ASSISTED LESSONS In the TL101 or on the myUnisa module sites of COS1501 and COS2601 you will find information regarding computer- assisted lessons. 14. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS We receive many calls from students asking the same questions. We have therefore decided to include a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) in this tutorial letter. Please read through the FAQs before contacting the school. 14.1 WHAT IS TUTORIAL LETTER 101 (TL101)? You will receive a TL101 for every module for which you are registered. The TL101 contains essential information such as information on administrative matters, assignment details as well as the prescribed textbook for that specific module. It is essential that you read carefully through the TL101 for each module. Do note that you will not receive any tutorial letters if you are registered for fully online modules offered by School of Computing. To obtain the study material, scheme of work, study resources and assignments for such modules you need to login to myUnisa. 14.2 ARE THERE ASSIGNMENTS THAT I NEED TO COMPLETE? DO I HAVE TO SUBMIT THE ASSIGNMENTS? Each module has at least one compulsory assignment that you need to complete and submit by the due date mentioned in your TL101 or on myUnisa. Please check carefully under the assignment section of your TL101 or on myUnisa how many assignment(s) you need to complete, what kind of assignment(s) they are and what the submission date(s) are. 14.3 DO I HAVE TO BUY THE PRESCRIBED TEXTBOOKS? CAN YOU RECOMMEND ANY FURTHER READING MATERIAL? If you are required to buy any textbook(s) for your module, particulars will be given in the TL101 or on myUnisa. The same applies to recommended reading(s). 14.4 WHAT DO I DO IF I EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH THE CONTENT OF THE STUDY MATERIAL? Contact your teaching assistant or e-tutor or one of the lecturers responsible for the module immediately. Please do not hesitate to contact us. You can phone any of the lecturers (check osprey for staff availability), or send an e-mail (recommended). Most modules have e-tutors and some modules have face-to-face tutors available at regional learning centers on most Saturday mornings. You need to register at the center to attend face-to-face tutoring. SOCALL0/301 22 14.5 I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED MY STUDY MATERIAL. CAN YOU SEND IT TO ME?  The School does not despatch study material. This is done by a different department.  You can also find and download your study material on myUnisa.  If you are registered for a fully online module, you will not be receiving any printed study material. Log on to myUnisa to access your study material. 14.6 WHEN DO CLASSES START AT UNISA? There are no classes; Unisa is a university that offers distance learning, and is not a residential University. We do not, therefore, offer classes to our students on a daily basis; but we do offer selected tutorial classes with a tutor electronically. Be wise and find out more about these (refer to TL101 or myUnisa for more information). 14.7 DO I HAVE GROUP DISCUSSIONS (THAT IS, VISITS FROM LECTURERS AT VARIOUS VENUES)? Information concerning group discussions (or workshops) for individual modules will be provided in TL101 (or on myUnisa), and/or follow up tutorial letters you will receive during the course of the semester/year. Group discussions will also be announced and scheduled on myUnisa. 14.8 WHEN AND WHERE AM I WRITING THE EXAMINATION? Lecturers do not schedule examination dates. This is done by the Examinations department. Should you have any enquiries about the examination date and time, please contact Exams. Note that Unisa has been conducting online examinations since 2020. The details of the online examinations will be communicated to you by the university well before the exam date. 14.9 WHEN WILL THE EXAMINATION RESULTS BE RELEASED? This is a decision taken by the Examinations department. The results are released when all the administration around it is complete. 14.10 WHERE DO I FIND MY EXAMINATION RESULTS? You can find your examination results on myUnisa. 14.11 WHAT DO I DO IF I AM NOT HAPPY WITH MY RESULTS? You can refer to myUnisa and follow the links Assignments & Examinations > Examinations. 14.12 WHERE DO I APPLY FOR MY EXAMINATION SCRIPT TO BE REMARKED OR RECHECKED? You can refer to myUnisa and follow the links Assignments & Examinations > Examinations. 14.13 WHEN DO THE SUPPLEMENTARY EXAMINATION/ AGREOTAT EXAMINATIONS TAKE PLACE? It will be available on myUnisa. SOCALL0/301 23 14.4 WHAT IS MYUNISA? myUnisa is the online learning management system of the University. If you are registered for a fully-online module you will be using myUnisa extensively. For non-fully online modules, you can find your study guides and tutorial letters in PDF format on the website for your module. You can communicate with your lecturers, with other students and with the administrative departments of Unisa – all through the computer and the Internet. You need to have Internet access to use myUnisa. 14.15 WHAT IS RPL? Recognition of prior learning (RPL) is the recognition by Unisa of any non-accredited learning of tertiary level related to a Unisa discipline which occurred before you decided to register for an academic qualification.  The RPL programme at Unisa enables you to gain recognition and credit for what you already know and are able to do at a level equivalent to University study.  You receive credit for what you have learned from experience, training courses, etc. RPL makes it possible for you to earn credits towards a UNISA qualification, thereby shortening your study time, and decreasing your study fees. For more information, go to www.unisa.ac.za and follow the links Colleges > Science, Engineering & Technology > Qualifications > Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) (https://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/corporate/default/Apply-for-admission/Undergraduate-qualifications/Recognition- of-Prior-Learning-(RPL)/RPL-for-module-credit ). 14.16 I WANT TO TRANSFER CREDITS FROM ANOTHER UNIVERSITY. HOW DO I DO THIS? You need to fill in an exemption application form, which is available on Unisa’s website and submit the form with all the relevant documents to the university as stated in the form. 14.17 WHAT CAN AN E- TUTOR DO FOR ME? Most modules offer electronic tutoring. A tutor can assist you to understand your study material, approach your assignments correctly, offer you more opportunities for practicing skills, etc. 14.18 WHAT CAN I DO IF I AM NOT A CONFIDENT READER OR WRITER? The Directorate for Counselling and Career Development can assist you to improve your study skills. Go to myUnisa, then follow the links Student support & Regions > Counselling and Career Development > About DCDD. 14.19 WHAT IF I HAVE RECEIVED A CD OR DVD AND I DON’T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO PLAY IT? Many regional learning centers have computers that students may use. You can also make use of the Telecentres as well. See how to contact regional centers and Telecentres in Section 2. SOCALL0/301 24 14.20 WHAT HAPPENS IF I NEED A PLACEMENT FOR WORK-INTEGRATED LEARNING (WIL)? Most WIL courses have a questionnaire in Tutorial Letter 101 or on myUnisa as well. Regional offices should also be able to assist you. 14.21 HOW MUCH CONTACT CAN I EXPECT? Distance education relies on independent self-study so the study material on its own should enable you to complete the module successfully. However, the University also offers some forms of contact besides letters, phone calls, e- mail or visits to lecturers in their offices. Most of the modules offer e-tutoring and electronic classes/discussions. The Directorate for Counseling and Career Development has counselors, literacy centers, peer collaborative learning facilitators, etc. 14.22 WHERE CAN I OBTAIN FINANCIAL AID? Go to Unisa’s Web page and follow the link Contact Us. 14.23 HOW DO I COMMUNICATE MODULE SUGGESTIONS, COMPLIMENTS AND COMPLAINTS? If you have module suggestions, compliments or complaints, please send a detailed e-mail to your module lecturer. Should you wish to escalate your complaints or compliments, use the e-mail address computing@unisa.ac.za. © UNISA 2022","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
