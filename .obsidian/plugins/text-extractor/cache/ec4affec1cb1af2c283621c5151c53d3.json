Briefly explain usability goals and user experience goals in the context of interaction design? Distinguish the difference between them. [1] 2. What makes the design of an interactive product good or bad? Use practical example to explain your answer. [1] 3. What is meant by the term learnability and how is it essential as a design goal of interactive design. Illustrate your argument with an example. [1] 4. In practice, Interaction Design is a process aimed at bringing usability to interactive products. Identify and briefly explain the four steps involved in this process. [1] 5 Effectiveness and efficiency are two of four usability goals identified by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015). With an example explain and distinguish these two goals. [1] Long questions (5) 1. Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) have asserted that that for interaction design to succeed many disciplines need to be involved from engineering, computer science, information sciences, to social sciences or even graphic design. Give the importance and downside of this assertion. [20] 2. Refer to Question 1, explain how experts such as psychologists, graphic designers and teachers would be required in the development of a kids computer learning game. [20] 3. Consider a Laptop Computer as an interactive product you would apply usability criteria. Identify three user experience amongst those outlined by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) and explain your experience as a user. [20] 4. The disciplines of interaction design and Human-computer interaction are closely related. Discuss the relationship and outline the difference between them particularly with regard to usability. [20] 5. In his seminal book The Design of Everyday Things (1988), Donald Norman coins the concept of Affordance. Explain what affordance means as a design principle essential in the interaction design process. Use a practical case of a website page, a desktop program or a mobile application to support your explanation. [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. Both explain usability goals and user experience goals are essential elements for the success of the design of interactive products. The major difference or nuance between them lies principally in the fact that Usability concerns objectively task-based interactions or the ability to do something well and easily hence terms like effectiveness, efficiency, learnerability, safety..While User experience refers subjectively to how a user feels when they interact with a product, their emotional connection with it; that is why adjectives like fun, enjoyable, cool, and so on are used for user experience goals. 2. As argued by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015), what makes an interactive product good or bad is primarily its Usability. This is viewed the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness,efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. the ease of use and learnability of an interactive product by its end-users. In other words, a product is good or bad first from the perspective of its users or consumers, the degree to which can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use. This is true for instance for websites, software applications as well as devices such as computers, TVs or mobile phones. 3. The concept learnerability refers to how the interactive product or system is easy to learn how to use. This is one of the essential usability criteria. Take for example a fancy looking TV set with a remote control full of buttons that the user would not understand nor manipulate. The TV becomes useless to them. 4. Indeed, Interaction Design is a process that consists in bringing usability to interactive products. The four steps that make up this process are: - Identifying needs and establishing requirements. - Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements. - Building interactive versions of the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed. - Evaluating what is being built throughout the process. 5. The terms effectiveness and efficiency are quite related. Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) have identified them as two of four usability golas/criteria - Effectiveness: The accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals. How a product/system is at doing what it is meant to do. - Efficiency: The resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals. How many steps are required to perform tasks. Answers long questions (5) 1. As indicated by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) nowadays more than before, the success of interaction design relies on the contribution of skills from various relevant disciplines be it engineering, computer science, information sciences, to social sciences or even graphic design. This allows everyone in such a team has different skills, and brings unique specialist knowledge or expertise to the table, thus allowing a very rounded view. A multidisciplinary design approach seeks to integrate the skills and methodology of designersfrom multiple disciplines into a collaborative effort.Multidisciplinary designers need to understand how diverse areas of expertise can come together to solve complex design problems The only downside of multidisciplinary interaction design 2. Referring to Question 1, specialists such as psychlogists, teachers and graphic designers would contributes their expertise in the development of a kids computer learning game as follows:. Psychologist: as a specialist who understands huma behaviour, cognitive and emotional processes, a psychologist would suggest appriopriate, safe and effective ways to combine education and leisure in the games. Teacher: as a professional would propose methods et devices to convey knowledge effectively to children. Graphic Designer: would devise designs that would be appropriate for kids, that would not only entice them but also entertain them and push them to learn by playing. 3. Here the student will choose and explain three user experiences from amongst others : - Satisfying - Enjoyable - Fun - Entertaining - Helpful - Motivating - aesthetically pleasing - supportive of creativity - rewarding - emotionally fulfilling 4. Both Interaction Design and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) are concerned with designing products/systems that usable to users. Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a subset of Interaction Design. Human Computer Interaction (HCI) involves the study, planning, and design of the interaction between people (users) and computers. In other words, HCI is a sociotechnological discipline whose goal is to bring the power of computers and communications systems to people in ways and forms that are both accessible and useful in our working, learning, communicating, and recreational lives Interaction Design is the practice of understanding users' needs and goals. designing tools for users to achieve those goals. Viewed this, Interaction design is much wider than include Human Computer Interaction. While the latter is limited to computer systems, the former includes any interactive products. 5. Affordance means to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use is. It refers to physical cues (eg. Being able to click a button on a mouse). Virtual affordance refers to visual signs (eg. Being able to press a link in a browser – in this case ensuring the link is highlighted in some way. Usually underlined and in a different colour to rest of text). Chapter 2: The process of interaction design (User-centered approaches to interaction design) Short questions (5) 1. Briefly explain the phrase “organizational memory” . [1] 2. What is artifact model? [1] 3. What is meant by the acronym PICTIVE? [1] 4. Explain the Contextual Design as data collection technique. [1] 5. What is CARD as a participatory design method? [1] Long questions (5) 1. Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) argue that users should be involved in the interaction design beyond just eliciting user or system requirements. Why do you think this is important? [20] 2. Identify and explain the four activities involved in the process of interaction Design. [20] 3. Outline and explain the three principles pioneered by Gould and Lewis (1985) regarding user-centered approach to system design. [20] 4. What is ethnography and why is it relevant to design of products and systems? [20] 5. Explain the concept of Contextual Inquiry and outline its constituent principles. [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. [pages 326] Organizational memory refers to the collective ability by an organization or a company to accumulate, store, and retrieve knowledge and data. Human memory is all about our ability to gain, store, and retrieve data Organizational memory has two principal repositories: the archives of the organization, and individual people’s memories. With the term archives, we also include the organization’s electronic databases. 2. [pages ] An artifact model shows how tangible elements (physical or electronic) are used and structured in the business process flow of doing the work. Work artifacts are one of the most important entities that get passed from one work role to another within the flow model. Examples include paper memos, email messages, correspondence templates, product change orders, and other things people create and use while working. 3. [pages 338] PICTIVE stands for Plastic interface for collaborative technology initiatives through video exploration. It is a paper mock-up technique that permits users to take part in the development process. A PICTIVE is an illustration of a Web page or a graphical user interface (GUI) on paper. The PICTIVE prototype helps users get an idea of how a system will look and act when it is finished. In PICTIVE, non-technical persons get the opportunity to contribute their ideas to the development process. 4. [pages 326] Contextual Design is a customer-centered design method that uses extensive field data as the foundation for understanding users’ needs, tasks, intents, and processes in order to design products and systems that meet both users’ and business’ needs. 5. [pages 340-341] CARD is an acronym for Collaborative Analysis of Requirements and Design. It is a design method where users are actively involved in the design process. Similar to PICTIVE it explores work flow not detailed screen design at a much higher level of abstraction. It uses playing cards with pictures of computers and screen dumps. Answers long questions (5) 1. [pages 311-313] Indeed as argued by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) , users should be involved in the interaction design process not just for eliciting user or system requirements. This is for two important reasons: Expectation management is the first reason is user involvement in design process. This consists in making sure that the users7 views and expectations of the new product or system are met without unpleasant surprises. It is better to exceed users' expectations than to fall below them. Therefore involving users throughout the development process helps with expectation management because they can see from an early stage what The system or product's capabilities are and what they are not. They will also understand better how it will affect their jobs and what 'they can expect to do with the product; they are less likely to be disappointed. Users can also see the capabilities develop and understand, at least to some extent, why the features are the way they are. Ownership is the second reason for user involvement. Users who are implicated and feel that they have contributed to a product's development, are more likely to feel a sense of \"ownership\" towards it and to be receptive to it when it finally emerges. 2. [pages ] The four activities involved in Interaction Design include: - First, identifying users’ needs and establishing system requirements - Second, Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements - Third, Building interactive versions of the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed - Four, Evaluating what is being built throughout the process 3. [pages 316-317] - Early Focus on Users and Tasks First: designers must understand who the users will be. This understanding is arrived at in part by directly studying their cognitive, behavioral, anthropometric, and attitudinal characteristics, and in part by studying the nature of the work expected to be accomplished. - Empirical Measurement Second: early in the development process, intended users should actually use simulations and prototypes to carry out real work, and their performance and reactions should be observed, recorded, and analyzed. - Iterative Design Third: when problems are found in user testing, as they will be, they must be fixed. This means design must be iterative: There must be a cycle of design, test and measure, and redesign, repeated as often as necessary. 4. [pages 319-322] Ethnography can be viewed as a scientific discipline concerned with studying and describing a culture, customs, beliefs, and behavior of a people based on information collected through fieldwork. As such ethnography is amply relevant in interaction design for several reasons amongst others: Ethnography is relevant to design for several reasons: 1. To gain insight on the user's environment First, since designers often create artifacts for work settings they know little about, some understanding of those settings is needed so that the technologies suit the situations of their use. 2. To eliminate the designers’ worldview Second, because technologies help shape the work practices of their users, it is important that the designers' worldview not be imposed inappropriately on users. If designers have little information regarding the situations in which technologies are used, the best they can do is rely on their own experiences and imagination thus running the risk of designing technologies better suited to their needs than those of the actual users. 3. To optimize technologies even when there is uncertainty regarding use Third, there are situations where designers create technologies whose possible uses are unknown. Such situations might be described as technology in search of an application. Some understanding of the work in which potential users are engaged can help identify possible uses and refine the original technology design. 4. To better understand the context of use 8 Fourth, in understanding that the utilization of technology is inextricably linked to the conditions of the user’s environment, technology that is tested in a more traditional [human machine dyad] may fail to capture important nuances. 5. To create (provide) a fuller (thorough; more comprehensive) picture (vision; visualization; representation) of the technology for the user. Fifth, when designing radically new technologies, users often are unable to give meaningful responses to queries about how they might use such technologies. They need to be provided with a way of envisioning and experiencing the technology in the context of their own work practices before they can contribute to such a discussion. To create the context for such a discussion and to be useful partners in the joint exploration of the relation between work and technology, designers must have some understanding of the user's work. 6. To shift design from single task focus in order to account for a more holistic understanding of outside influences on the users. Finally, the singletask focus of some technology design efforts is ill-suited to design of technologies that support task integration. Simply focusing on a single task or the tasks of the single user ignores how the work of one individual articulates with that of many others. For example, a print shop operator's work may rely on the work of document creators, word processing specialists, graphic artists, sales representatives and many others. Systems that support the print shop operator's work should be designed with some larger understanding of how the work of these others impinges upon the work of the print shop operator. Great designs don't just appear overnight – they take time to get right. UX designers and, in fact, all other kinds of designer know that they don't get one try to make a product the best it can be, it takes many iterations to get the product the way that it best suits the user. Iterative design processes are used across all design disciplines to produce results that count. A UX designer should ensure that they understand how iteration works and how to best use it in their own work. 5. [pages] [pages] Contextual Inquiry is an approach to ethnographic study where user is expert, designer is apprentice. It is a form of interview, but at users’ workplace The four main principles of a contextual inquiry are: — Context: see workplace & what happens — Partnership: user and developer collaborate — Interpretation: observations interpreted by user and developer together — Focus: project focus to help understand what to look for Chapter 3-Conceptualizing Interaction Short questions (5) 1. Why is important to understand the problem space before attempting the design of an interactive system? [1] 2. Succinctly explain conversing as conceptual model activity: [1] 3. What is meant by Storyboarding of designing a conceptual model of a system. [1] 4. Formulating a conceptual model is a process. What steps make up this process? [1] 5 Why is a conceptual model important and crucial for the success of an interactive design project? [1] Long questions (5) 1. With regard to conceptual models based on activities, Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) identify four major activities that users are likely to be engaged in when interacting with a system. Identify those and briefly explain each with an illustration [20] 2. Conceptual models are principally categorized according to the activity or object they are based on. Differentiate these two categories with examples. [20] 3. Identify the benefits and potential problems with interface metaphors [20] 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Direct manipulation as a conceptual design activity? [20] 5. After the analysis of various conceptual models, in your opinion which one is the best? [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. There are many practical benefits to thoroughly understanding the problem space. The first one is That this can highlight problematic concerns. In so doing, it can identify ideas that need to be reworked, before it becomes too late in the design process to make changes. Having a good understanding of the problem space can also help greatly in formulating what it is you want to design. Another key aspect of conceptualizing the problem space is to think about the overall structure of what will be built and how this will be conveyed to the users. In particular, this involves developing a conceptual model. 2. Conversing: It is an underlying model of having a conversation with another human. It ranges from simple voice recognition menu driven systems to more complex ‘natural language’ dialogs. Examples include timetables, search engines, advice-giving systems, help systems. Also virtual agents, toys and pet robots designed to converse with users. 3. As a method to design a conceptual model, storyboarding consists in representing of how the system will function, screen by screen much like shots of a video. Typically a number of squares with illustrations or pictures representing screen/shot, with notes about what's going on in the screen. 4. Steps in formulating a conceptual model include: - What will the users be doing when carrying out their tasks? - How will the system support these? • -What kind of interface metaphor, if any, will be appropriate? - What kinds of interaction modes and styles to use? always keep in mind when making design decisions how the user will understand the underlying conceptual model 5. A conceptual model is: a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates”. It enables – designers of interactive products and systems to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets. This not only minimize errors but it also makes the process of designing more manageable. Answers long questions (5) 1. The most common types of activities identified by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) are: 1. instructing: This kind of conceptual model describes how users carry out their tasks through instructing the system what to do. Examples include giving instructions to a system to perform operations like tell the time, print a file, and remind the user of an appointment. 2. conversing: This conceptual model is based on the idea of a person conversing with a system, where the system acts as a dialog partner. Examples include advisory systems, help facilities, and search engines. The proposed tourist application described earlier would fit into this category. 3. manipulating and navigating: This conceptual model describes the activity of manipulating objects and navigating through virtual spaces by exploiting users' knowledge of how they do this in the physical world. For example, virtual objects can be manipulated by moving, selecting, opening, closing, and zooming in and out of them. 4. exploring and browsing: This conceptual model consists in allowing people to explore and browse information, exploiting their knowledge of how they do this with existing media (e.g., books, magazines, TV, radio, libraries, pamphlets, brochures). 2. The first category of conceptual models based on activities prototype systems to design based on activities or functions that they per including instructing, conversing with, manipulating and navigating or exploring and browsing the system. While the second category of conceptual models is based on an object or artifact, such as a tool, a book, or a vehicle. These tend to be more specific than conceptual models based on activities, focusing on the way a particular object is used in a particular context. They are often based on an analogy with something in the physical world. An example of a conceptual model based on an object is the Accounting systems that mimic manual bookkeeping systems with pen and account books. 3. Benefits of interface metaphors - Makes learning new systems easier - Helps users understand the underlying conceptual model - Can be very innovative and enable the realm of computers and their applications to be made more accessible to a greater diversity of users Problems with interface metaphors: - Break conventional and cultural rules – e.g. recycle bin placed on desktop - Can constrain designers in the way they conceptualize a problem space - Conflict with design principles - Forces users to only understand the system in terms of the metaphor - Designers can inadvertently use bad existing designs and transfer the bad parts over - Limits designers’ imagination in coming up with new conceptual models 4. Advantages of Direct Manipulation: - Novices can learn the basic functionality quickly - Experienced users can work extremely rapidly to carry out a wide range of tasks, even defining new functions - Intermittent users can retain operational concepts over time - -Error messages rarely needed - Users can immediately see if their actions are furthering their goals and if not do something else - Users experience less anxiety - Users gain confidence and mastery and feel in control 1 Disadvantages of Direct Manipulation - Some people take the metaphor of direct manipulation too literally - Not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be done directly - Some tasks are better achieved through delegating – e.g. spell checking - Can become screen space ‘gobblers’ - Moving a mouse around the screen can be slower than pressing function keys to do same actions 5. [here the answer of each student should be properly analyzed] After the analysis of various conceptual models we came to the following conclusion: Direct manipulation is good for ‘doing’ types of tasks, e.g. designing, drawing, flying, driving, sizing windows. Issuing instructions is good for repetitive tasks, e.g. spell-checking, file management. Having a conversation is good for children, computer-phobic, disabled users and specialized applications (e.g. phone services). Hybrid conceptual models are often employed, where different ways of carrying out the same actions is supported at the interface - but can take longer to learn Chapter 5 Short questions (5) 1. What are collaborative technologies. Illustrate with examples. [1] 2. Explain the term telepresence. [1] 3. What is meant by situational awareness and how is critical for collaboration in a team? [1] 4. Explain the phrase adjacency pairs as postulated by Shegloff and Sacks(1973). [1] 5. What is meant by the term copresence? [1] Long questions (5) 1. Explain the phrase Computer mediated communication (CMC) and outline few of its benefits. [20] 2. Explain the concept of Distributed Cognition as developed by Ed Hutchins et Alii (1995) developed a paradigm for conceptualizing human work activities . [20] 3. Provide the theoretical grounding that underpins the language/action framework and briefly outlines its five categories. [20] 4. Demonstrate how an ethnographic analysis is important for the interaction design of a of collaboration and communication system. [20] 5. Differentiate between Verbal and non-verbal communication. [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. Collaborative technologies are all types of technologies that facilitate communication, collaboration, coordination, and learning at various throughout an organization. They allow people to interact effectively in virtual environments. Includes messaging and discussion forums, audio and video conferencing, knowledge portals, business directories, and Web cams. 2. Telepresence refers to the use of technologies including virtual reality and telerobotics to allow a person to feel as if they were present, to give the appearance of being present at a place other than their true location. 3. Situational awareness refers to being aware of what is happening around you in order to understand how information, events, and your own actions will affect ongoing and future events. Having good situational awareness is critical in technology-rich work domains, such as air traffic control or an operating theater, where it is necessary to keep abreast of complex and continuously changing information. 4. In conversation analysis, an adjacency pair is a two-part exchange in which the second utterance is functionally dependent on the first, as exhibited in conventional greetings, invitations, and requests. It is also known as the concept of nextness. Each pair is spoken by a different person. 5. The state or condition of being present along with others; associated presence. Answers long questions (5) 1. Computer-mediated communication CMC) refers to any form of communication between two or more individual people who interact and/or influence each other via separate computers through the Internet or a network connection - using social software. Some of the benefits of computer mediated communication include: - Computer mediated communication breaks down geographical barriers to communication enabling collaboration through communication over distance. - People can exchange, store, edit, broadcast, and copy any written document. They can send data and messages instantaneously, easily, at low cost, and over long distances. Messages can be sent to groups of any size and can be programmed for such special functions as automatic copying to a pre-specified distribution list. Two or more people can look at a document and revise it together, consult with each other on critical matters or ask for and give assistance . 2. Distributed cognition is the theory that knowledge lies not only within the individual but in the individual's social and physical environment. It refers to a process in which cognitive resources are shared socially in order to extend individual cognitive resources or to accomplish something that an individual agent could not achieve alone. Human cognitive achievements are based on a process in which an agent's cognitive processes and the objects and constraints of the world reciprocally affect each other. 3. The language/action framework is based on the understanding that people act through language . It was developed to inform the design of systems to help people work more effectively through improving the way they communicate with one another. It is based on various theories of how people use language in their everyday activities, most notably speech act theory. There are five categories of speech acts: Assertive-commit the speaker to something being the case Commissive--commit the speaker to some future action Declarations-pronounce something has happened Directives-get the listener to do something Expressive-express a state of affairs, such as apologizing or praising someone 4. Ethnography is a qualitative research method used to study people and cultures. It is largely adopted in disciplines outside software engineering, including different areas of computer science. Ethnography can provide an in-depth understanding of the socio-technological realities surrounding everyday software development practice. It can help to uncover not only what practitioners do, but also why they do it. In other words, as an observational and non-interventionist research technique ethnography identified as a useful tool to software design because it observes and analyses the social context in which the applications are to be used by the target population. Ethnography being the framework and based in the experiences found in the literary review, participant observation and a semi-structured questionnaire were the tools chosen to implement this remote user study. 5. Communication can be viewed as a natural phenomenon; it is an act of interacting with people and sharing information with them. Verbal Communication is communication in which the sender uses words, whether spoken or written, to transmit the message to the receiver is known as Verbal Communication. It is the most effective form of communication that leads to the rapid interchange of information and feedback. There are fewer chances of misunderstanding as the communication between parties is clear, i.e., the parties are using words for saying anything. The communication can be done in two ways (i) Oral – like face-to-face communication, lectures, phone calls, seminars, etc. (ii) Written – Letters, E- mail, SMS, etc. Non-verbal communication is based on the understanding of the parties to communication, as the transmission of messages from the sender to receiver is wordless i.e., the communication uses signs. So, if the receiver understands the message completely and proper feedback is given afterwards, then the communication succeeds. It complements the verbal communication many times, to understand the mindset and the status of the of the parties, which is not spoken by them, but it is an act of understanding. Chapter 6 Emotional Interaction Short questions (5) 1. What is meant by phrase Affective Computing? [1] 2. Explain the term User experience(UX) as used interaction design. [1] 3. Mention three ways embodied conversational interface agents can emulate human conversation. [1] 4. What is meant by Believability ? [1] 5. What is meant by emotional agent ? [1] Long questions (5) 1. From the usability point of view, identify sources of frustration for a user with a system, website or application. Explain how they would emotionally affect a user. [20] 2. Explain three ways expressive interfaces can be implemented in interactive systems like websites or desktop applications. [20] 3. What is the difference between anthropomorphism and zoomorphism and how they relate to interaction design? [20] 4. Demonstrate how appearance of an interactive system such as a website can affect a user and provide a remedy. [20] 5. Explain the concept the concept anthropomorphism as design approach in Human Computer interaction and outline its pros and cons. [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. Affective Computing refers to the approach in computer engineering that suggests that computers be designed to recognize and express emotions in the same way humans do. 2. User experience (UX) refers to a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. 3. Three ways embodied conversational interface agents can emulate human conversation include conversational mechanisms such as: -recognizing and responding to verbal and non-verbal input generating verbal and non-verbal output -coping with breakdowns, turn-taking and other conversational mechanisms -giving signals that indicate the state of the conversation as well as contributing new suggestions for the dialog. 4. Believability is meant the extent to which users interacting with an agent or virtual character come to believe that it has its own beliefs, desires and personality\" 5. Answers long questions (5) 1. The following factors are the source of user frustration with a system, a website or application. - When the user is overburdened the for-instance upgrading software results in extended fixing session tweaking preferences, restoring settings, or also for example missing Plugins on the Web - when an application doesn't work properly or crashes - when a system doesn't do what the user wants it to do - when a user's expectations are not met - when a system does not provide sufficient information to let the user know what to do - when error messages pop up that are vague, obtuse, or condemning - when the appearance of an interface is too noisy, garish, gimmicky, or patronizing - when a system requires users to carry out many steps to perform a task, only to discover a mistake was made somewhere along the line and they need to start all over again 2. Expressive interfaces can be implemented in interactive systems like websites or desktop applications in the following three ways: — visually such as expressive icons , user generated emoticons such as happy : ), Sad : (, Great job :Y, I 1 2 CU 2nite. — audio visually e.g., using interface agent — audio e.g., You’ve got mail! Welcome!, Goodbye, action that cannot be performed 3. Anthropomorphism signifies ascribing human qualities to other objects, animals, and inhuman creatures in order to give an insight into their functions. Zoomorphism, on the other hand, means assigning a person, event, or a deity with animalistic characteristics. 4. An unpleasant appearance of a website does affect users and its usability in many ways for instance : - websites that are overloaded with text and graphics, making it difficult to find the information desired and slow to access - flashing animations, especially banner ads, which are very distracting the copious use of sound effects and Muzak, especially when selecting options, -carrying out actions, starting up CD-ROMs, running tutorials, or watching website demos -featuritis-an excessive number of operations, represented at the interface as banks of icons or cascading menus -childish designs that keep popping up on the screen, such as certain kinds of helper agents -poorly laid out keyboards, pads, control panels, and other input devices that cause the user to press the wrong keys or buttons when trying to do something else As a remedy,websites Interfaces should be designed to be simple, perceptually salient, and elegant and to adhere to usability design principles, well-thought-out graphic design principles. 5. The anthropomorphic approach to human-computer interaction involves designing a user interface to possess human-like qualities. For instance, an interface may be designed to communicate with users in a human-to-human manner, as if the computer empathizes with the user. Interface error messaging in often written this way, such as, “We’re sorry, but that page cannot be found.” Another example is the use of avatars in computer-based automation, as can be found in automated telephony systems. For example, when a voice-response system cannot understand what the user has spoken, after several attempts it may reply in an apologetic tone, “I’m sorry, I can’t understand you.” Pros As pros anthropomorphism: - makes system more interactive and fun - strong factor in human motivation - harmless bit of fun Cons As cons anthropomorphism: - could make people feel anxious or inferior e.g., screen characters that wave their fingers at the user. - poor anthropomorphic designs can trigger user frustration and anger Chapter 8: Data gathering (Identifying needs and establishing requirements) Short questions (5) 1. What is meant by naturalistic observation? [1] 2. Briefly explain the concept of Hierarchical Task Analysis. [1] 3. How can scenarios used as system requirement method? [1] 4. What is task analysis and does it differ from other methods? [1] 5. What is document analysis as a data gathering technique? [1] Long questions (5) 1. Compare and contrast Interviews and Questionnaires as data gathering methods. Outline advantages of each method. [20] 2. Explain the concept Functional Requirements and outline typical examples. [20] 3. In your opinion, what would be the adavantages of a Focus Group as a data gathering technique? [20] 4. Explain Use Cases as a system design technique and outline its potential benefits. [20] 5. Outline the difference between user requirements, business requirements and system requirements. [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. Naturalistic observation is a research method that consists in observing subjects (users) in their natural environment. This type of research is often utilized in situations where conducting lab research is unrealistic, cost prohibitive or would unduly affect the subject's behavior. 2. Hierarchical Task Analysis is a detailed examination of the tasks users must do to achieve particular aims. In its simplest form, a hierarchical task analysis has a comprehension of the tasks users must do to achieve particular goals. It lets you break jobs down into multiple levels of subtasks. It thus describes an activity in terms of its specific goals, sub-goals, operations, and plans. 3. A scenario is an \"informal narrative description\" (Carroll, 2000). It describes human activities or tasks in a story that allows exploration and discussion of contexts, needs, and requirements. Used this way scenario can be a powerfull tool to elicit knowledge about the system to build. 4. Task analysis A process of analysing the way people perform their tasks. It covers techniques for investigating cognitive processes and physical actions, at a high level of abstraction and in minute detail. Task analysis is used mainly to investigate an existing situation, not to envision new systems or devices. It is used to analyze the underlying rationale and purpose of what people are doing: what are they trying to achieve, why are they trying to achieve it, and how are they going about it. 5. Document analysis is a qualitative research in which documents are interpreted by the researcher to give voice and meaning around an assessment topic . Analyzing documents incorporates coding content into themes similar to how focus group or interview transcripts are analyzed. Answers long questions (5) 1. Both Interviews and questionnaires are data collection methods wherein people respond to questions. The interview is a data gathering method consisting in a direct conversation between interviewer and respondent takes place. It is carried out with a purpose like a survey, research, and the like, where both the two parties participate in the one to one interaction. Questionnaire refers to a research instrument, in which a series of questions, is typed or printed along with the choice of answers, expected to be marked by the respondents. The respondents are supposed to read, comprehend and give their responses, in the space provided. The major difference between questionnaires and interviews is the presence of an interviewer. In questionnaires, responses are limited to answers to predetermine questions. In interviews, since the interviewer is present with the subject, there is an opportunity to collect nonverbal data as well and to clarify the meaning of questions if the subjects do not understand. Advantages of questionnaires over interviews include: they are likely to be less expensive, particularly in terms of the time spent collecting the data. They can be given to large numbers of people simultaneously; they can also be sent by mail. Therefore, it is possible to cover wide geographic areas and to question large number of people relatively inexpensively. Also subjects are more likely to feel that they can remain anonymous and thus may be more likely to express controversial opinions. This is more difficult in an interview, where the opinion must be given directly to the interviewer Advantages of interviews over questionnaires are: questioning people who cannot write their responses. This category also includes illiterate subjects or subjects who do not write as frequently as they speak. Oral responses from these individuals will contain much more information than would their written responses. Another advantage of the interview method is that is actually results in a higher response rate than does the questionnaire. Many people who would ignore a questionnaire are willing to talk, with an interviewer who is obviously interested in what they have to say. Another advantage of the interview technique is that you can plan to ask questions at several levels to get the most information from the subject. 2. Functional requirements can be defined as those requirement which specify what the system should do. In other words, a functional requirement will describe a particular behaviour of function of the system when certain conditions are met, for example: “Send email when a new customer signs up” or “Open a new account”. A functional requirement for an everyday object like a cup would be: “ability to contain tea or coffee without leaking”. Typical functional requirements include: - Business Rules - Transaction corrections, adjustments and cancellations - Administrative functions - Authentication - Authorization levels - Audit Tracking - External Interfaces - Reporting Requirements 3. A focus group is a small group discussion in which participants respond to a series of questions focused on a single topic. In practice, a facilitator would meet with five to twelve people to collect in-depth qualitative information about the group's ideas, perceptions, attitudes, or experiences on the defined topic. The advantages of focus groups include: - they are useful to obtain detailed information about personal and group feelings, perceptions and opinions - they can save time and money compared to individual interviews - they can provide a broader range of information - they offer the opportunity to seek clarification - they provide useful material eg quotes for public relations publication and presentations 4. A use case is a written description of how users will perform tasks on a system. It outlines, from a user’s point of view, a system’s behavior as it responds to a request. Each use case is represented as a sequence of simple steps, beginning with a user's goal and ending when that goal is fulfilled. Use cases present some benefits as a design method. They add value because they help explain how the system should behave and in the process, they also help brainstorm what could go wrong. They provide a list of goals and this list can be used to establish the cost and complexity of the system. Project teams can then negotiate which functions become requirements and are built. 5. Business requirements describe why the organization is undertaking the project. They state some benefits that the developing organization or its customers expect to receive from the product. Business requirements may be delineated in several documents such as a project charter, business case, or in a project vision and scope statements. User requirements, also referred to as user needs, describe what the user does with the system, such as what activities that users must be able to perform. User requirements are generally documented in a User Requirements Document (URD) using narrative text. User requirements are generally signed off by the user and used as the primary input for creating system requirements. System requirements are the building blocks developers use to build the system. These are the traditional “shall” statements that describe what the system “shall do.” System requirements are classified as either functional or non-functional requirements. A functional requirement specifies something that a user needs to perform their work. For example, a system may be required to enter and print cost estimates; this is a functional requirement. Non-functional requirements specify all the remaining requirements not covered by the functional requirements. Chapter 14: Introducing Evaluation Short questions (5) 1.

What is Heuristic Evaluation and what are its benefits to the design process? [20] 5. Explain Cognitive Walkthrough with practical examples to substantiate your answer. [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. Heuristics are rules that are used to inform the evaluation or inspection of an interactive product or design. 2. Triangulation is a term that describes how different perspectives are used to understand a problem or situation. In practice, Triangulation involves using combinations of techniques in concert to get different perspectives or to examine data in different ways. 3. Mockup products are products or prototypes used to test its usability by users. Often, the product being developed may be a brand-new product or an upgrade of an existing product. If the product is new, then considerable time is usually invested in market research. Designers often support this process by developing mockups of the potential product that are used to elicit reactions from potential users. 4. The five reasons Tognazzini presents for investing in user testing are: - Problems are fixed before the product is shipped, not after. - The team can concentrate on real problems, not imaginary ones. - Engineers code instead of debating. - Time to market is sharply reduced. - Upon first release, the sales department has a rock-solid design it can sell without having to pepper their pitches with how it will all actually work in later releases. 5. The ten heuristics provided by Jakob Nielsen are: 1. Visibility of system status: 2. Match between system and the real world: 3. User control and freedom: 4. Consistency and standards: 5. Error prevention: 6. Recognition rather than recall: 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design: 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: 10. Help and documentation: Answers long questions (5) 1. Usability testing involves measuring the performance of typical users on typical tasks. It is a way to see how easy to use something is by testing it with real users. Users are asked to complete tasks, typically while they are being observed by a researcher, to see where they encounter problems and experience confusion. If more people encounter similar problems, recommendations will be made to overcome these usability issues. Some of benefits of usability testing include: - feedback direct from the target audience to focus the project team - internal debates can be resolved by testing the issue to see how users react to the different options being discussed - issues and potential problems are highlighted before the product is launched - it increases the likelihood of usage and repeat usage - it minimises the risk of the product failing - users are better able to reach their goals, which results in the business meeting its targets 2. Evaluation is the process of examining a system or product to determine what's working, what's not, and why Formative evaluation is a type of usability evaluation that helps to \"form\" the design for a product or service. Formative evaluations involve evaluating a product or service during development, often iteratively, with the goal of detecting and eliminating usability problems. One important aspect of formative evaluation is that the audience for the observations and recommendations is the project team itself, used to immediately improve the design of the product or service and refine the development specifications. Results can be less formal than in summative evaluation, as suits the needs of designers, developers, project managers, and other project participants. A summative evaluation is Usability evaluation of a complete or near-complete design under realistic conditions that can be used to determine if the design meets specific measurable performance and/or satisfaction goals, or to establish a usability benchmark or to make comparisons. This approach is in contrast to a formative evaluation which is used to find and eliminate problems during the design and development process, rather than judge a completed product against specific goals. 3. Evaluation assesses the extent to which an interactive system is easy and pleasant to use. Evaluation is needed to check that users can use the product and like it. Furthermore, nowadays users look for much more than just a usable system, as the Nielsen Norman Group 4. Heuristic evaluation is a technique that evaluates a design based on its compliance with recognized usability principles. A heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method for computer software that helps to identify usability problems in the user interface (UI) design. Heuristic evaluations have the benefit of being very efficient and focused (for example, an accessibility evaluation is focused on accessibility problems.) However, most practitioners prefer user-based testing because they have more confidence in the results. Ideally, teams should use both, as effective heuristic evaluations make user-based testing more productive by focusing on hard-to-find problems. 5. The cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method in which one or more evaluators work through a series of tasks and ask a set of questions from the perspective of the user. The focus of the cognitive walkthrough is on understanding the system's learnability for new or infrequent users. The cognitive walkthrough was originally designed as a tool to evaluate walk-up-and-use systems like postal kiosks, automated teller machines (ATMs), and interactive exhibits in museums where users would have little or no training. However, the cognitive walkthrough has been employed successfully with more complex systems like CAD software and software development tools to understand the first experience of new users.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
