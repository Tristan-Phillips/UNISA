Interaction design is designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives. It is about creating user experiences that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate, and interact. 1.2 Give a brief job description for an interaction designer The role of the Interaction Designer is to create the best possible user experience for the users. Interactive designers use technology to create desired user experiences. They work primarily with navigation structures and interface functions. Interaction Designer work on the foundational to the business application or product being developed; their focus is on how the design will actually work. The interaction designer spends most of their time with user research, testing and psychology. 1.3 What is the difference between interaction design (ID) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI)? The difference between Interaction Design (ID) and Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) is that Interaction Design (ID) is concerned with the theory, research, and practice of designing user experiences for all manner of technologies, systems, and products, whereas Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) has traditionally had a narrower focus, being “concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them”. 1.4 List different things that interaction designers need to know about interactions between users and technologies in order for them to create effective user experience. - Designers need to understand how people act and react to events - How people communicate and interact with each other. To be able to create engaging user experiences, - They also need to understand how emotions work, what is meant by aesthetics, desirability, and the role of narrative in human experience. - Developers also need to understand the business side, the technical side, the manufacturing side, and the marketing side. Page 3 INF3720 Assignment 1 Stu No: 34759050 1.5 What are the aspects of user experience that can be considered when designing interactive products? List any five. i. the usability, ii. the functionality, iii. the aesthetics, iv. the content, v. the look and feel, vi. the sensual and emotional appeal. 1.6 Discuss McCarthy and Wright’s (2004) core threads that make up holistic experiences McCarthy and Wright core threads that make up our holistic experiences: sensual, emotional, compositional, and spatiotemporal: i. The sensual thread. This is concerned with our sensory engagement with a situation and is similar to the visceral level of Norman's model. It can be equated with the level of absorption people have with various technological devices and applications, most notable being computer games, smartphones, and chat rooms, where users can be highly absorbed in their interactions at a sensory level. These can involve thrill, fear, pain, and comfort. ii. The emotional thread. Common examples of emotions that spring to mind are sorrow, anger, joy, and happiness. In addition, the framework points out how emotions are intertwined with the situation in which they arise – e.g. a person becomes angry with a computer because it does not work properly. Emotions also involve making judgments of value. For example, when purchasing a new cell phone, people may be drawn to the ones that are most cool-looking but be in an emotional turmoil because they are the most expensive. They can't really afford them, but they really would like one of them. iii. The compositional thread. This is concerned with the narrative part of an experience, as it unfolds, and the way a person makes sense of it. For example, when shopping online, the options laid out to people can lead them in a coherent way to making a desired purchase or they can lead to frustrating experiences resulting in no purchase being made. When in this situation, people ask themselves questions such as: What is this about? Where am I? What has happened? What is going to happen next? What would happen if . . .? The compositional thread is the internal thinking we do during our experiences. iv. The spatio-temporal thread. This refers to the space and time in which our experiences take place and their effect upon those experiences. There are many ways of thinking about space and time and their relationship with one another: for example, we talk of time speeding up, standing still, and slowing down, while we talk of space in terms of public and personal places, and needing one's own space. Page 4 INF3720 Assignment 1 Stu No: 34759050 Question 2 2.1 What do you understand by the term conceptual model? Conceptual model refers to High-level description of how a system is organized and operates. It is an abstraction that outlines what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand interacting with it. 2.2 What are the benefits of conceptualizing the design space? i. Orientation – enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the targeted users. ii. Open-mindedness – preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focused early on. iii. Common ground – allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on. 2.3 Why are interface metaphors important in interaction design? Metaphors are considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. They provide a structure that is similar in some way to aspects of a familiar entity (or entities) but also have their own behaviours and properties. 2.4 Briefly describe the interface metaphor behind the desktop computer The Interface metaphors are intended to provide familiar entities that enable users to easily understand the underlying conceptual model and know how to interact with a system. The desktop metaphor is an interface metaphor which is a set of unifying concepts used by graphical user interfaces to help users interact easily with the computer. The desktop metaphor treats the computer monitor as if it is the user's desktop, upon which objects such as documents and folders of documents can be placed. A document can be opened into a window, which represents a paper copy of the document placed on the desktop. Small applications called desk accessories are also available, such as a desk calculator or notepad. The desktop metaphor contravenes people’s expectations since access and usability are more important. The recycle bin sits on the desktop, as well as disks (storage areas which in real world are not found on a desktop. Other features such as menu bars, task bars, or docks have no counterpart on a real-world desktop. Page 5 INF3720 Assignment 1 Stu No: 34759050 2.5 As an interaction designer, briefly describe the main interaction types that you would use to design a train-booking system for a semi-illiterate community. The main interaction types that would be used to design a train-booking system for a semi-illiterate community are Instructing and Conversing. 1. Instructing – For the semi-illiterate community this can be done in many ways, including: speaking aloud commands, gesturing, pressing buttons, or using a combination of function keys. 2. Conversing – User has a dialogue with the system by means of speech-based or typed-questions-based interface. Examples include: when booking train ticket and train-times inquiries. Text-free user interfaces for illiterate and semiliterate users’ guidelines will be used. i. Use static hand-drawn representations with voice annotations ii. Avoid text - Less text will make it easier for subjects who cannot read. However, numerals can be included in the UI to represent currency when purchasing train tickets (at least for certain target users). iii. Pay Attention to Subtle Graphical cues: User Response may depend on Psychological, cultural or Religious biases iv. Provide Help on All Screens v. Use Semiabstract Graphics and Increase Photorealism with Deeper Interaction The Train Booking system must be in graphical form since the target users are semi illiterate. vi. Provide Voice Feedback for All Functional Units Question 3 Discuss how social media have changed the way in which students keep in touch, make contact, and manage their social and learning life. Social media have changed the way in which students interact with each other. Students who live far from each other, in different cities, countries and continents can communicate quickly and easily through social media. Before the emergence of social media communication was through telephone calls or letters, in most cases communication was delayed. Below is how social media has changed the way students interact with each other 1. Social Collaboration refers to processes that help students to interact and share information to achieve common educational goals for example, LinkedIn and Facebook 2. Communication forms of electronic communication through which students create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other educational content (such as videos) for example websites for social networking skype and dropbox. Page 6 INF3720 Assignment 1 Stu No: 34759050 3. Interaction, a platform where students actively interact with one another. There are different forms of interactions on each social network. The most common kinds of interactions are likes, comments and shares. Different platforms might have slightly different names and symbols. 4. Social Media Groups a feature in social networking which allows students with common background and interests to establish and join online discussion groups. Examples include Social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and LinkedIn. 5. Sharing of Resources social media facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. Question 4 4.1 What is emotional interaction and what does it entail? Emotional interaction is concerned with how we feel and react when interacting with technology. It covers different aspects of the user experience, from how we feel when first finding out about a new product to getting rid of it. It also looks at why people become emotionally attached to certain products (for example virtual pets), how social robots might help reduce loneliness, and how to change human behaviour using emotive feedback. 4.2. In interaction design, explain the term anthropomorphism and its disadvantages. Anthropomorphism is attributing human qualities to object. It has been used in interaction design to design applications that have human-like qualities. Examples include virtual characters and robot pets that have been developed to motivate people to learn, buy, and listen. Disadvantages i. Make people feel inferior ii. Make people anxious iii. Studies have shown that personalized feedback is considered to be less honest and makes users feel less responsible for their actions (for example Quintanar, 1982) iv. Lack the ability to follow a conversation and fail to suggest appropriate help. v. Speech recognition systems incorrectly may translate people say. vi. If the technology is targeted for novice users, experts may become frustrated. vii. Giving users no control over the system frustrates users. viii. The systems deceive users because they think that computers have all human capabilities, hence they blame them when something goes wrong. ix. Agents cannot give some common examples that are not related to the current problem Page 7 INF3720 Assignment 1 Stu No: 34759050 Question 5 5.1 What type of interview would you conduct with the child? Please justify your choice. The type of interview would be unstructured interview, questions will be asked face to face with the children giving explanations to all questions. Children between the ages of 6 and 9 think and react to situations differently from adults, the interview will rely on images, chat, a set of smileys will be developed so that the children can select the one that most closely represents their feelings A set of Robotic Toys images or words on them (e.g. pictures of media) will be used to ask the children to demonstrate their understanding and questions will be asked to explain their classification. Blank cards will be included in case the children want to add something or draw a functionality they would like included in a Robotic Toy. 5.2 Formulate at least five appropriate interview questions. 1. Do you like Robotics toys and why? 2. Do you have a Robotics toys and what is your favourite toy? 3. What do you like most about robotic toys? Why? 4. What do you like least about robotic toys? Why? 5. What functionality would you like from this Robotics Toy? 5.3 Conduct the interview and discuss your findings with regard to emerging design ideas. Based on the results of the unstructured interview, the following findings with regard to emerging design ideas were formulated. - The Robotic Toy must be easy to use - The Toy must be genderless, cross-cultural, any child, from any background, must be able to use it - Kids enjoy the educational benefits that comes with robotic toys? Toys that can introduce hands-on learning - The design should focus on themes this means that the child has greater independence, and is therefore more likely to benefit from creativity, self- reflection, social interaction - Toys that can promote interactive learning and provide information beyond the scope of the teacher’s knowledge base","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
