Note: Your answers per question should be short. Submit your assignment through myUnisa. Question 1 Explain the difference between usability goals and user experience goals. (2 marks) Answer Usability is concerned with the “effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which specified users achieve specified goals in particular environments” (ISO 9241-11) User experience is concerned with “all aspects of the user’s experience when interacting with the product, service, environment or facility” (ISO 9241-210) . Question 2 a. What is a conceptual model? (2 marks) b. Briefly describe the four components that make up a conceptual model. (8 marks) Answer Allocate 2 mark for the definition - High-level description of how a system is organized and operates. - An abstraction that outlines what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand interacting with it. Allocate 2 marks for discussing each component Core components of a conceptual model: - Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity. - The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes and the operations that can be performed on them. - The relationship between those concepts. - The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke. Question 3 (18 marks) In HCI we consider how interactive systems can be designed to provoke or avoid emotional responses within users. Choose the following three aspects of emotional interaction or affective computing as subheadings and explain how interfaces and interaction experiences can engender emotions in the user. In each subsection, use your mobile phone to give examples of specific techniques or objects that elicit various kinds of emotional responses. The subheadings are: expressive interfaces, frustrating interfaces, and persuasive technologies. Answer i. Expressive interface forms like: emoticons, sounds, icons, visual agents, animations, vibration feedback, spoken messages have been used to: • convey emotional states; and / or (both the user and the interface) • Elicit certain kinds of emotional responses in users, such as feeling at ease, comfort, and happiness. 4 Icons and animations have been used to indicate the current state of a mobile phone, notably when it is booting up or being rebooted. The icon conveys a sense of friendliness, inviting the user to feel at home. The appearance of the icon on the screen is also very reassuring to users, indicating that their mobile phone is working correctly. (only explaining and providing examples of expressive interfaces, 3 marks) Examples of mobile phone expressive interfaces: (providing examples of expressive interfaces based on mobile phone experience, 3 marks) • Dynamic icons (e.g.: recycle bin expanding when a file is placed in it); • Animations (e.g.: battery icon showing how far the battery is charging, icons for the various apps making it easy to see what you choosing without thinking); • Spoken messages, using various kinds of voices, telling the user what needs to be done (e.g.: GPS); • Various sonifications indicating actions and events (eg: pop up messages that remind you to change your mobile phone password or to upgrade apps) • Vibrotactile feedback (eg: Cell phone buzzes for certain types of calls). • Users can also express their emotions e.g. - by using emoticons in Whatsapp messages. • Personalization of graphical user interfaces of mobile phones, e.g a picture in the background. • Good looking interfaces are often more satisfying and pleasurable to use. A key concern is therefore to strike a balance between designing aesthetic and usable interfaces. (E.g. with most mobile phone what the user would like to see and shortcut icons can all be changed to suit the user preference) ii. Frustrating: application not working or crashing, user expectations not met, application does not do what the users wants, vague error messages, gimmicky, patronizing, interface, too many steps to do a task, insufficient info. (Listing frustrations only without giving examples 3 marks) Typical reasons for frustration when using a mobile phone: (giving examples of frustrations based on their mobile phone experiences, 5 marks). 1. Application does not work properly e.g. when you want to use certain apps the mobile phone freezes and you have to reboot the phone. 2. Doesn't do what users want it to, e.g. the auto correct when typing messages, if you do not double check before sending messages, you would send meaningless messages. 3. Not sufficient information, e.g. help documentation on mobile phone apps does not usually provide sufficient instructions for a user to successfully configure an application. 4. Vague/obtuse error messages, e.g. error messages such as “system not available, try later” are meaningless because they do not specify a time period after when a user can try again. It would be more helpful to provide information about how to resolve / overcome the problem. Threatening error messages can also cause users to become anxious. The use of bold red letters and exclamation marks can be counter-productive. Ideally, error messages should be treated as \"how to fix it\" messages. They should state the cause of the problem, and what the user needs to do to fix it. 5. Frustration can happen with voice commands. Sometimes voice commands fail to recognise some people’s accents. 6. Websites or software apps that take a long time to download can be frustrating. Links that hang and eventually do not load can also be very annoying. 7. Another common frustration is upgrading software. More often than not it is time-consuming, and requires a range of things such as resetting preferences, checking configurations, and learning new ways of doing things. 8. Mobile websites that are overloaded by text and graphics, making it difficult to find and access information, too much scrolling; 9. Typing on a phone's default on-screen keyboard can be frustrating due to errors. iii. Persuasive technologies currently being used to change people’s behavior includes pop-ups, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, etc. Persuasive strategies include: Just in time persuasion, Simulating experience, Personalizing, Recommendation, Monitoring and tracking, Competition and recognition. (only explaining and giving examples of persuasive technologies, 3 marks) 4 Mobile phone persuasive technology experience (Students are expected to give a variety of technologies that are based on their experiences, 3 marks). Question 4 (30 marks) This question involves a practical data gathering exercise. Suppose you have to design a robotic toy that looks just like a normal doll or toy car, but displays some intelligent interactive behaviour towards a child playing with it. Your aim is to find out from a child what functionality they would like such a toy to have. You have to conduct an interview with at least one child from pre-school to grade three (ages 6 to 9 years). 4.1 What type of interview would you conduct with the child? Please justify your choice. (5 marks) 4.2 Formulate at least five appropriate interview questions. (5 marks) 4.3 Conduct the interview and discuss your findings with regard to emerging design ideas. (10 marks) 4.4 Discuss the interview process, mentioning any difficulties you experienced in conducting the interview. (10 marks) Answer Students would provide a variety of answers and would be evaluated accordingly Question 5 (20 marks) Assume that you are involved in developing a new mobile phone e-learning site for a high school mathematics course. Suggest ways of applying the user-centered principles in this task. Answer Early focus on users and tasks (8 marks) Students are expected to contextualize the answers to their mobile phone experiences) Understand the high school students by directly studying their cognitive, behavioural, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics. In this case we know that our users are going to be high school students. • The syllabus and outcomes have to be studied, and subject matter experts consulted, and it should be determined how technology can be used to improve the learning experience. This requires observing higher school students doing their normal tasks, studying the nature of those tasks, and then involving the students in the design process. (explaining the main principle, 3 marks) Students are expected to expand on the above to discuss the design of mobile phone e-learning site under the following sub principles (5 marks). • User tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development - Technology should not be the driving force • User’s behavior and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them. • User’s characteristics are captured and designed for. • Users are consulted throughout the development from the earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account. • All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment. Empirical measurement (6 marks) (Students are expected to contextualize this to the design of a mobile phone e-learning site. Without contextualizing students lose marks) At the beginning of the project, identify and document the targeted usability and user experience goals. This enables the mobile phone e-learning site to be empirically evaluated at regular stages as it is developed. The insights gathered from these measurements can guide the designers to choose between alternative designs. Iterative design (6 marks) (Students are expected to contextualize this to the design of a mobile phone e- learning site. Without contextualizing students lose marks) Feedback is essential to the iterative design process. Iteration is required because designers never get the solution right the first time. 4 When problems are found in user testing, they are fixed and then more tests and observations are carried out to see the effects of the fixes. This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of design-test- measure-redesign being repeated as often as necessary.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
