Conceptualizing design • Proof of concept – conceptualize what the proposed product will do • Why the need to conceptualizing design? • to scrutinize vague ideas and assumptions about the benefits of the proposed product in terms of their feasibility • how realistic is it to develop? • how desirable and useful? www.id-book.com Assumptions and claims • Write down your assumptions and claims when coming up with a new design • Try to defend and support them by what they will provide • Those that are difficult to articulate – can highlight what ideas are vague or unrealistic – identify human activities and interactivities that are problematic • Iteratively work out how the design ideas might be improved www.id-book.com What is an assumption? • Taking something for granted when it needs further investigation – e.g. people will want to watch TV while driving http://www.ibiblio.org/jlillie/cooltown/lillie.htm www.id-book.com What is a claim? • Stating something to be true when it is still open to question – e.g. “a multimodal style of interaction for controlling GPS — one that involves speaking while driving — is safe” www.id-book.com Activity: How will enabling robot waiters to speak to customers enhance their experience? www.id-book.com Source: Xinhua/Guo Cheng, www.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-12/23/c_134945262.htm What is the problem being addressed? • The benefits: – the robot could take orders and entertain customers by having a conversation with them – could make recommendations for different customers, such as restless children or fussy eaters • But just assumptions • The real problem being addressed: “It is difficult to recruit good wait staff who provide the level of customer service to which we have become accustomed.” www.id-book.com Working through assumptions • Many unknowns need to be considered in the initial stages of a design project – where do your ideas come from? – What sources of inspiration were used? – Is there any theory or research that can be used to inform them? • During the early ideation process – ask questions, reconsider assumptions, and articulate concerns www.id-book.com A framework for analysing the problem space • Are there problems with an existing product or user experience? If so, what are they? • Why do you think there are problems? • How do you think your proposed design ideas might overcome these? • If you are designing for a new user experience how do you think your proposed design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of doing things? www.id-book.com Activity • What were the assumptions and claims made about watching 3D TV? www.id-book.com Figure 3.2 A family watching 3D TV Source: Andrey Popov/Shutterstock.com Assumptions and claims: how realistic? • There was no existing problem to overcome – what was being proposed was a new way of experiencing TV • An assumption – People would really enjoy the enhanced clarity and color detail provided by 3D • A claim – People would not mind paying a lot more for a new 3D-enabled TV screen because of the new experience www.id-book.com Benefits of conceptualising • Orientation – enables design teams to ask specific questions about how the conceptual model will be understood • Open-minded – prevents design teams from becoming narrowly focused early on • Common ground – allows design teams to establish a set of commonly agreed terms www.id-book.com From problem space to design space • Having a good understanding of the problem space can help inform the design space – e.g. what kind of interface, behavior, functionality to provide • But before deciding upon these it is important to develop a conceptual model www.id-book.com Conceptual model • A conceptual model is: “…a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates” (Johnson and Henderson, 2002, p26) • Enables “…designers to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets” (Johnson and Henderson, 2002, p28) • Provides a working strategy and framework of general concepts and their interrelations www.id-book.com Components • Metaphors and analogies – understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity • Concepts that people are exposed to through the product – task–domain objects, their attributes, and operations (e.g. saving, revisiting, organizing) • Relationship and mappings between these concepts www.id-book.com First steps in formulating a conceptual model • What will the users be doing when carrying out their tasks? • How will the system support these? • What kind of interface metaphor, if any, will be appropriate? • What kinds of interaction modes and styles to use? - always keep in mind when making design decisions how the user will understand the underlying conceptual model www.id-book.com Conceptual models • Many kinds and ways of classifying them • The best conceptual models are often those that appear – obvious and simple – the operations they support are intuitive to use www.id-book.com Interface metaphors • Interface designed to be similar to a physical entity but also has own properties – e.g. desktop metaphor, web portals • Can be based on activity, object or a combination of both • Exploit user’s familiar knowledge, helping them to understand ‘the unfamiliar’ • Conjures up the essence of the unfamiliar activity, enabling users to leverage this to understand more aspects of the unfamiliar functionality www.id-book.com Examples of interface metaphors • Conceptualizing what users are doing, – e.g. surfing the web • A conceptual model instantiated at the interface, – e.g. the desktop metaphor • Visualizing an operation, • e.g. an icon of a shopping cart for placing items into www.id-book.com The card metaphor • The card is a very popular UI • Why?: Has familiar form factor • Can easily be flicked through, sorted, and themed • Can structure content into meaningful chunks – similar to how paragraphs are used to chunk a set of related sentences into distinct sections • Material properties giving appearance of surface of paper www.id-book.com Figure 3.5 Google Now card for restaurant recommendation in Germany Source: Johannes Shonning: schoening@uni-bremen.de. Benefits of interface metaphors • Makes learning new systems easier • Helps users understand the underlying conceptual model • Can be very innovative and enable the realm of computers and their applications to be made more accessible to a greater diversity of users www.id-book.com Problems with interface metaphors • Break conventional and cultural rules – e.g. recycle bin placed on desktop • Can constrain designers in the way they conceptualize a problem space • Conflict with design principles • Forces users to only understand the system in terms of the metaphor • Designers can inadvertently use bad existing designs and transfer the bad parts over • Limits designers’ imagination in coming up with new conceptual models www.id-book.com Activity • Describe the components of the conceptual model underlying most online shopping websites, e.g. – Shopping cart – Proceeding to check-out – 1-click – Gift wrapping – Cash till www.id-book.com Interaction types • Instructing – issuing commands and selecting options • Conversing – interacting with a system as if having a conversation • Manipulating – interacting with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them • Exploring – moving through a virtual environment or a physical space • Responding – the system initiates the interaction and the user chooses whether to respond www.id-book.com 1. Instructing • Where users instruct a system and tell it what to do – e.g. tell the time, print a file, save a file • Very common conceptual model, underlying a diversity of devices and systems – e.g. word processors, VCRs, vending machines • Main benefit is that instructing supports quick and efficient interaction – good for repetitive kinds of actions performed on multiple objects www.id-book.com Which is easiest and why? www.id-book.com 2. Conversing • Underlying model of having a conversation with another human • Range from simple voice recognition menu- driven systems to more complex ‘natural language’ dialogs • Examples include timetables, search engines, advice-giving systems, help systems • Also virtual agents, chatbots, toys and pet robots designed to converse with you www.id-book.com Pros and cons of conversational model • Allows users, especially novices to interact with a system in a way that is familiar to them – can make them feel comfortable, at ease and less scared • Misunderstandings can arise when the system does not know how to parse what the user says – e.g. voice assistants can misunderstand what children say www.id-book.com www.id-book.com 3. Manipulating • Involves dragging, selecting, opening, closing and zooming actions on virtual objects • Exploit’s users’ knowledge of how they move and manipulate in the physical world • Can involve actions using physical controllers (e.g. Wii) or air gestures (e.g. Kinect) to control the movements of an on screen avatar • Tagged physical objects (e.g. balls) that are manipulated in a physical world result in physical/digital events (e.g. animation) www.id-book.com Direct Manipulation (DM) • Ben Shneiderman (1983) coined the term DM • 3 core properties: – Continuous representation of objects and actions of interest – Physical actions and button pressing instead of issuing commands with complex syntax – Rapid reversible actions with immediate feedback on object of interest www.id-book.com Benefits of direct manipulation • Novices can learn the basic functionality quickly • Experienced users can work extremely rapidly to carry out a wide range of tasks, even defining new functions • Intermittent users can retain operational concepts over time • Error messages rarely needed • Users can immediately see if their actions are furthering their goals and if not do something else • Users experience less anxiety • Users gain confidence and mastery and feel in control www.id-book.com Disadvantages of DM • Some people take the metaphor of direct manipulation too literally • Not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be done directly • Some tasks are better achieved through delegating, e.g. spell checking • Can become screen space ‘gobblers’ • Moving a cursor using a mouse or touch pad can be slower than pressing function keys to do same actions www.id-book.com 4. Exploring • Involves moving through virtual or physical environments – users can explore aspects of a virtual 3D environment – physical environments can also be embedded with sensors that when detect the presence of someone will trigger digital or physical events to happen • Many examples of virtual environments, including cities, parks, buildings, rooms, and datasets – enable users to fly over them and zoom in and out of different parts www.id-book.com Seeing things larger than life in VR www.id-book.com Reproduced with permission. http://home.comcast.net/~sharov/3d/cave.html Exploring data in VR www.id-book.com Image courtesy of Kalev Leetaru, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois. Responding • System takes the initiative to alert user to something that it “thinks” is of interest • Does this by: – detecting the location and/or presence of someone in a vicinity and notifies them on their phone/watch, – what it has learned from their repeated behaviors • Examples: – alerts the user of a nearby coffee bar where some friends are meeting – user’s fitness tracker notifies them of a milestone reached • Automatic system response without any requests made by the user www.id-book.com This type suggested by Christopher Lueg et al. (2018) Potential cons of system initiated notifications • Can get tiresome or frustrating if too many or the system gets it wrong • What does it do when it gets something wrong? • Apologise? • Allow user to correct the advise or information? www.id-book.com Choosing an interaction type • Direct manipulation is good for ‘doing’ types of tasks, e.g. designing, drawing, flying, driving, sizing windows • Issuing instructions is good for repetitive tasks, e.g. spell-checking, file management • Having a conversation is good for certain services, e.g. finding information, requesting music • Hybrid conceptual models are good for supporting multiple ways of carrying out the same actions www.id-book.com Difference between interaction types and interface styles • Interaction type: – A description of what the user is doing when interacting with a system, e.g. instructing, talking, browsing or responding • Interface style: – the kind of interface used to support the interaction, e.g. command, menu-based, gesture, voice www.id-book.com Many kinds of interface styles available (see chapter 7)… • Command • Speech • Data-entry • Form fill-in • Query • Graphical • Web • Pen • Augmented reality • Gesture www.id-book.com Other sources • Of conceptual knowledge that are used to inform design and guide research are: – paradigms – visions – theories – models – frameworks www.id-book.com Paradigm • Inspiration for a conceptual model • General approach adopted by a community for carrying out research – shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices – e.g. desktop, ubiquitous computing, in the wild www.id-book.com Examples of new paradigms in HCI • Ubiquitous computing • Pervasive computing • Wearable computing • Internet of Things www.id-book.com Visions • A driving force that frames research and development • Invites people to imagine what life will be like in 10, 15 or 20 years time – e.g. Apple’s 1987 Knowledge Navigator – Smart Cities, Smart Health – Human-centred AI • Provide concrete scenarios of how society can use the next generation of imagined technologies • Also raise ethical questions, e.g. privacy, trust www.id-book.com Questions raised by tech visions • How to enable people to access and interact with information in their everyday lives • How to design user experiences where there is no obvious user control • How and in what form to provide contextually relevant information to people • How to ensure that information passed around interconnected devices, and objects is secure www.id-book.com Theory • Explanation of a phenomenon – e.g. information processing that explains how the mind, or some aspect of it, is assumed to work • Can help identify factors relevant to the design and evaluation of interactive products – e.g. cognitive, social, and affective • Can be used to predict what users will do with different interfaces www.id-book.com Models • A simplification of an HCI phenomenon – enables designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs – abstracted from a theory coming from a contributing discipline, e.g. – Don Norman’s (1996) model of the seven stages of action – Marc Hassenzahl’s (2010) model of the user experience www.id-book.com Frameworks • Set of interrelated concepts and/or specific questions for ‘what to look for • Provide advice on how to design user experiences – helping designers think about how to conceptualize learning, working, socializing, fun, emotion • Focus on how to design particular kinds of interfaces to evoke certain responses • Come in various forms: – e.g. steps, questions, concepts, challenges, principles, tactics and dimensions www.id-book.com A classic HCI framework Don Norman’s (1988) framework of the relationship between the design of a conceptual model and a user’s understanding of it • Consists of three interacting components: • The Designer’s Model – The model the designer has of how the system should work • System Image – How the system actually works, which is portrayed to the user through the interface, manuals, help facilities, and so on • The User’s Model – How the user understands how the system works www.id-book.com Summary • Developing a conceptual model involves: – understanding the problem space – Being clear about your assumptions and claims – specifying how the proposed design will support users • A conceptual model is a high-level description of a product in terms of – what users can do with it and the concepts they need to understand how to interact with it • Interaction types provide a way of thinking about how to support user’s activities • Paradigms, visions, theories, models & frameworks – provide ways of framing design and research www.id-book.com","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
