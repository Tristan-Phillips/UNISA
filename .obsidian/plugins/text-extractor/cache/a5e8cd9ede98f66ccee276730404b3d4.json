The interface is neutral and acceptable, and South African art could be used to improve look and feel. 5.5 Cameras, biosensors, sound evaluation, body movement detectors, eye trackers, etc. [p. 179-182] Telegram can use the cell phone’s built-in camera and audio recording function to measure users’ reactions to its interface. Question 6: Chapter 6 10 marks 6.1 From the perspectives of Anthony Ortony model of emotional design, how do you design interactive products that invoke the visceral, behavioural, and reflective senses. (3 marks) Answer • Visceral – Instinctive, first impressions driven by initial sensory inputs such as appearance, feel, and sound. Invocation of opportunity and exploration • Behavioural –Equates to traditional values of usability. Human actions are performed at behavioural level. How you feel when using a particular product. • Reflective – The meaning of personal value of a product in a culture. Reflective emotions are long lasting and influenced by culture, knowledge, and experience. 6.2 Visit the websites for UNISA, Wits and UCT and comment on how the design of their websites’ main page (first page) satisfies each of the components of Anthony Ortony’s model. Which websites persuade you to enrol at the university, support your answer? (3 marks) Answer (Allocate 1 mark per university) I provide a sample answer for UNISA. Students are expected to provide a similar analysis on the other universities. Visceral Behavioural Reflective • UNISA • Dynamic banner that shows informative current affairs of the university. • Vibrant colours and images of happy people. • Pleasing website, makes me like to enrol at the university at first site. • Great user experience. • Website easy to navigate. • Links and buttons are well labelled. • An easy-to-use website. • The website gives a sense of belonging. • Graduating students gives me a sense of achievement. • The picture of former president, T. Mbeki is inspiring and invokes my sense of leadership. Wits xxx xxx xxx UCT xxx xxxx xxx 6.3 Based on the weaknesses that you identified from the above websites, design the front page of UNISA website with features that invokes the visceral emotions of students who seek to enroll at the university in 2023. You can use any application to design a non- interactive main page (MS Word, Power point …or any other web editor). Focus on the design of the page not the functionality. Copy and paste the screenshot of the designed main page. Briefly describe how you incorporated the visceral component of Anthony Ortony model in the design of the website. (4 marks) Answer (allocate 2 marks for the design and 2 marks for the explanation) Students will present their designs and explain how they incorporated the Anthony Ortony’s model. I just copied and pasted UNISA website here. Question 7: Chapter 8 In question 6, you recreated the main page of the UNISA website to improve user experience. Now you are in the process of testing the user experience of the website: 7.1 Who are the stakeholders of the website front page that you recreated? (2 marks) Answer (allocate 1 mark each for any two) Students, lecturers, administrative personnel 7.2 Explain the type of sampling that you would use to select the respondence in your study? (1 mark) Answer (allocate 1 mark) Stratified sampling because data should be collected from different groups of stakeholders to have a balanced view of each group’s needs. 7.3 Explain how each of the following data gathering techniques can be used to collect data when testing the website front page that you recreated. (3 marks) Answer (allocate 1 mark per technique) Technique Explanation • Interview • Structured interview protocol • Small number of participants • Audio record the interviews, transcribe, clean data, analyse, and write a report Questionnaire • Open ended or closed ended questionnaire • To collect data from many users • Collect data, clean it, analyse, and write a report Observation • Observation protocol • Collect data from a small sample • Recruit the participants • Set the test environment, set up recording equipment, carry an activity with each participant, record, moderate and observe the participant. • Analyse the recording and write a report. 7.4 Explain why consent forms are valuable when collecting data. (2 marks) • Potential participants should accept and volunteer to participate in a study • Potential participants should not be coerced or forced to participate • Potential participants should be given time to ask questions • It is ethical 7.5 List any 2 interview questions that you are going to use to collect data from students. (2 marks) Answer • A variety of questions from students. Depends on their creativity and understanding. • For example: ▪ How would you apply for an undergraduate degree from the UNISA main page? ▪ From the UNISA main page, how do you go to the College of Science and Technology? Question 8: Chapter 11 School of Computing have a small library, which is not associated with university’s main library. The library has a collection of information systems and computer science textbooks and journals. The library uses excel spreadsheet to manage the library and the challenge is that when borrowers get books from the library, they return them late or sometimes never return them. The borrowers include students and all school of computing staff. You have been approached by the School of Computing to write a software program that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non-returned books are tracked. 8.1 Identify any two common types of requirements discovery in the context of the library system (2 marks). [p. 398-414] Answer (Allocate 1 mark per point for any two) • Using probes to engage with users • Contextual inquiry • Brainstorming for innovation • Personas • Scenarios • Probes • Contextual inquiry 8.2 Identify any 2 functional requirements of the library system (2 marks). Answer (Allocate 1 mark per point for any two) • A borrower can request to loan a book • Find if the borrower has books that are overdue • If the borrower has books that are overdue, refuse loan • If the borrower does not have any books, loan the book • Set the due date 8.3 Choose one functional requirement of the library systems and present it as an atomic requirement. Use the Volere template (Page 389, prescribed book). (5 marks) 8.4 What are user stories? (2 marks) Answer (Allocate 1 mark per point for any two) • Communicate requirements between team members • Each represents a unit of customer visible functionality • Capture usability and user experience goals • User story represents a small chunk that can be delivered during a sprint. 8.5 Based on the functional requirement that you choose, express it as a user story. (2 marks) Answer (allocate 2 marks) Here are two examples, students would provide a variety of answers • As a <librarian> I want <to know which book loans are overdue> so that <I will refuse to loan other books to the offender> • As a < MSc Student> I want <to have access to electronic books > so that <I do not travel to campus library to borrow or return books> 8.6 Based on the information about potential users, choose a user profile and produce a persona and a scenario capturing how the user is expected to interact with the library system. (7 marks) Answer (see mark allocation in the table) Persona Scenario (2 marks) Name: Peter (1 mark) Age: 25 Degree: MSc Information Systems Campus: Florida Goal (1 marks) • To access online journals • To download journal papers • To access electronic research methodology books Frustrations (1 marks) • Forgets to take back books to library • Travelling to campus to borrow books, 100 kms. • No money to travel to the campus to return books. BIO (2 marks) Peter is a 25-year-old MSc student in the Department of Information Systems. Peter is a full-time student residing in a rural area about 100 kms from Johannesburg. Peter is busy with his literature analysis for his MSc research, which is to have at least twenty references. He visits the online library and searches for journal papers. The search returns several papers, he selects and downloads some papers. He failed to download 3 papers that required subscription. Peter got frustrated and he wrote an email to the librarian to download and email the papers to him. Peter also found that that the library has two books on research methodology that are only in hardcopy. He wrote to the librarian to post the books to his rural address. His research focusses on Africanisation of Information Systems subjects and wants to access research material to support his research. Peter wants to access and download journal papers from the online library. Additionally, he wants to access electronic research methodology textbooks. If the university does not have electronic copies of books, it should deliver and pick up the books from his rural home. Assignment 03 Solution -2022 Question 1 This question takes you through the complete software development lifecycle for an interactive product. You are required to design and evaluate an interactive product for booking tickets online for a cinema. A user is supposed to be able to book a venue for watching a movie. Most cinema venues have an online booking facility already, but it can be awkward and frustrating to identify and book the seats you want. For you to successfully answer this question, you need you talk with some people to understand their requirements, maybe a family member (20 marks). 1.1 Identify users’ needs (requirements) for the online facility. To identify user needs, you should collect data from the users. Record your data in point form (5 marks). Answer The form of data gathering students use, will depend on circumstances that they encounter. There are plenty of people to talk to about how they obtain tickets for an event and gather their requirements needs. Hence, students are expected to provide a variety of answers to this question. For example: • View movies that are showing from the cinema website • Choose the movie • Choose a venue for watching • Choose time that you want to watch • Choose seat, where you want to seat • Order headphones or earphones • Order 3D glasses • Pay • Receive SMS/email confirmation 1.2 Based on the user requirements, choose a user profile, and produce one persona and one scenario, capturing how the user is expected to interact with the product. (Students are expected to provide a user profile and produce one persona, then describe a scenario in detail, capturing how the user is expected to interact with a system, for example, a ticket booking system) (5 marks). Persona (2 marks) Scenario (2 marks) Name: Peter (1 mark) Age: 17 Partially deaf Goal • To watch a movie • To book a movie online • To have hearing aids in the movie house Frustrations • Some movie houses do not have hearing aids • Some websites are difficult to follow to make a booking • payment systems fails to go through BIO Peter is a 17-year-old man who is partially deaf and stays in Centurion, Pretoria. He completed his matric recently and has few friends due to his condition. Peter spends most of his time at his family house and he is lonely. For leisure, he wants to watch movies at a local cinema. Even though he will not be talking other people cinema, he enjoys being amongst other people. Peter enjoys taking part in virtual chat environments. Late one night, he is in conversation with someone who recommends that he go and see the latest James Bond movie that has just come out. It's too late to email the local cinema to see if it's on there, so he decides to use the internet to obtain some tickets for the following weekend. At the cinema website he looks for the film titles currently showing. The James Bond movie is indeed showing. From this page, chooses the 7pm performance, but it is fully-booked and offers him alternatives: the 5.30pm and the 8pm. Dan chose the 8pm booking, confirmed the booking seat, and pays for it. As he is partially deaf, he needs to double-check that the cinema is equipped with suitable sound amplification technology that links in to his hearing aid. 1.3 Perform a task analysis on the main tasks associated with the ticket booking system, i.e booking a ticket (5 marks). The tasks Peter was involved with were: • Finding if the film was on at the cinema • Finding out the times of showing • Choosing the showing • Choosing the seat • Confirming the booking • Paying for the booking • Checking for other facilities at the cinema Note that this is not a complete HTA, but is a starting point. 1.4 Using the data gathered in 1.1 and your subsequent analysis, identify different kinds of requirements for the product under the following headings: environmental, user and usability (5 marks). Answer Some basic considerations and example requirements from this scenario are given below. Your scenarios may be very different, and will hence yield very different requirements: Environmental (the answer should take into consideration physical, social, organisational, technical environments) (2 Marks) The user might be in a variety of physical settings, and at different times of day, e.g. at home, in the street, in the rain, etc. In our scenario Dan was probably sitting at a desktop computer but he could have been using a cell phone. User (2 marks) There are potentially many different kinds of users. You must decide who your website is targeted for: children under 18? only adults with a credit card? What about visually impaired users, or the elderly who may have difficulties controlling their movement? Usability (1 marks) The website should be usable the first time, without any training. This is an expression of the Volere requirement for the functional requirement. Question 2 Go to myUnisa under Additional resources and download the file “Case study – Academic library. pdf”. Read the case study and answer the following questions. (20 marks) 2.1 What was the purpose of the usability evaluation? (2 marks) • To determine whether or not the library’ users could effectively use the web site to perform specific tasks. • To determine how effective the library website worked when used for library research by undergraduates with little or no experience using the website 2.2 Which challenges were encountered in carrying the usability testing of the website? (4 marks) • A range of heterogeneous library participants (users) to choose from • Setting the questions fr usability testing • privacy of the testing room, to allow participants to comfortably talk aloud • Some of the participants were not punctual on appointment time and some did not pitch up • Participants had varying learning abilities and technical proficiency • Difficulties in interpreting the results due to subjective nature of variables such as aesthetics and idiosyncrasies • Presenting tasks to users in a way that the testers would learn the participants’ responses and actions • Designing unambiguous and specific questions that evaluate the usability of the site’s functionalities rather than the technical skills of the participants. • Multiple links of the website confused participants when navigating from one page to the other. 2.3 List any five specific activities/tasks performed by the participants during the usability testing of the website. (5 marks) • Do the University Libraries own the book Alias Grace? • Is the journal Northeast Anthropology available in the UB Libraries? • Can you find a journal article on gospel music? • How would you find a journal article on soap operas? • I am interested in investing in what are referred to as “callable securities.” Where can I find recent articles about them? (You need to see the full article.) • Use the database SocioFile to look for an article about nursing homes and mental illness. What would you have to do to obtain this article? • How would you go about finding the author of this quotation: “And we meet, with champagne and a chicken, at last?” • Assume you are taking a class in a subject you know very little about, for example, psychology, literature, environmental science, architecture or film. If you were assigned a research paper, how would you find information resources on that subject? • Find an encyclopedia article about French wine. • Obtain background information about the “ethnic cleansing” that has taken place in Kosovo. • Does the Libraries’ Web site have a guide to doing research in computer science? 2.4 Which data collection methods were used to collect data? (4 marks) • Think aloud • Direct observation of users being tested • A written log of events that took place during testing • A record of user movements during navigation • Post evaluation user satisfaction questionnaire • Post evaluation report by the tester 2.5 List any five issues discovered by the usability testing. (5 marks) • The “Web Search” and “Need Help” links failed the “easy to learn” measure • Participants confused by the meaning of, “Online Resources” and “Library Catalogues” , which resulted in failing to satisfy the “causes few errors” measure • The process of connecting to the catalog through the “Web-interface link” was unnecessarily unpleasant. • “Online Resources” page was difficult to decipher • Users did not find the “Online Resources” page easy to use when searching an article from a named database. Participants could not identify the database titles. • On finding articles on general topics, the ‘Online Resources” page failed the entire usability test because the participants could not identify the “Quick Start” link. • The participants could not identify “reference Resources” as a logical link to begin exploration of a topic. Question 3 Assume the role of an expert evaluator and do a heuristic evaluation of a single typical student task that you have identified as a possible problem on myUnisa. Use all ten heuristics and complete the table below. (20 marks) Name of the task:_________________ (Provide the name task. You cannot evaluate myUnisa because it is too big. you only have time to evaluate a single task) Heuristic Findings 1. Visibility of the system status 2. Match between system and the real world 3. User control and real world 4. Consistency and standards 5. Error prevention 6. Flexibility and efficiency of use 7. Recognition rather than recall 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 9. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors 10. Help and documentation Answer The answer is dependent on the task chosen and we will provide a few general guidelines. Firstly, the evaluator should consider all ten Nielsen heuristics evaluation. Students may modify some of the heuristics to evaluate some specific aspects of myUnisa system. Secondly, students should consider the format that they will use for the evaluation. The easiest is to construct a fill-in questionnaire listing the heuristics and then giving it to a few other myUnisa users or students (including yourself) to complete. After the evaluation you could compile a list of all the usability problems that have been identified and then sort them according to their impact or severity. You can also sort the list according to how easy (or costly) it will be to fix the usability problems. You will then be able to present to the myUnisa development team a list of usability problems that are rated as severe and easy to fix at the top (i.e. high priority problems) to not severe and difficult to fix at the bottom (or low priority or costly-to-fix problems)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
