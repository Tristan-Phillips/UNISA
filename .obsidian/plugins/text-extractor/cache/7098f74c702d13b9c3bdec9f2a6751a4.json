Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) is a private tutoring company in South Africa that provides tutoring services to students who are enrolled for diplomas and degrees in Information Systems at various colleges and universities. In the past, ITS’s tutors have been using WhatsApp to communicate with their students, but the company has decided to consider other options due to concerns about WhatsApp’s new terms and conditions that will be implemented in 2021. ITS considers the following alternatives: • Developing its own Africanised messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients • Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localise the app for the South African market INF3720 Jan/Feb Please turn over Assume that you have been appointed by Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) as an HCI expert.

The developers of a new e-reader want to find out how appealing an e-reader would be to senior citizens over 65 years of age. To this end, they have asked you to conduct some interviews for them. You are required to answer the following questions in preparation for the interview: 4.1 What is the goal of your data gathering session?

Question 5 (23 marks) The case study is hypothetical. The School of Computing (SoC) have a small library, which is not associated with the university’s main library. The SoC library has a collection of Information Systems and Computer Science textbooks and journals. The library uses an Excel spreadsheet to manage the library. The challenge is that borrowers return books late or don't return them. The borrowers include students and all School of Computing staff. You have been approached by the SoC to design a system that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non-returned books are tracked. 5.1 Identify three functional requirements of the library information systems application.
