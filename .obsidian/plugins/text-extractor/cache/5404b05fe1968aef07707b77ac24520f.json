The time allowed per session will be 25 minutes, and is proportional to the time for the final exam. You may start the mock exam any time between 16h00 and 21h00, but note that at 21h00 the session that you may still be busy with, will automatically save your answered questions and submit them. So make sure you start at least 25 minutes prior to the end time. The first session contains questions about Sections 1,2 and 6 (as in the example exam paper on myUnisa under Additional Resources), and the second session contains questions about Sections 3, 4 and 5. You can do the sessions in any order, provided that you complete and submit the one before opening the next one. For those of you who attempted the previous mock exams, for this one the ‘previous’ button and the table of contents will not be available (as it is not allowed for the final exam due to system overhead). You should still be able to use the ‘Question Progress’ tab on the bottom right of the screen to go back to questions that you did not answer. If you can't see it properly reduce the size of your screen slightly. To access the online assessment tool, click on myModules, then on SITES in the top right of the screen, and then select your module, and click on the online assessment tool. You will then see your two sessions for the mock exam.
