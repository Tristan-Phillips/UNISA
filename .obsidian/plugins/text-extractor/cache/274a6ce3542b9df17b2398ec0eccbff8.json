Past examination papers have been placed on myUnisa for you to review/practice. Remember: you must be able to deﬁne concepts, or discuss them – not every question will be of a practical nature. Don’t make the mistake of only studying the operation of the algorithms: you must understand the theory and concepts relating to them as well. Plan your time when writing the paper. You have two hours to get 100 marks. All the questions are compulsory. This means you have little time to waste. Take your time to determine which questions you are comfortable answering and answer them ﬁrst. Don’t worry about the order in which you answer questions in your script. However, please indicate clearly what answer goes with which question. We don’t mind looking around for an answer, but once we have to start hunting we may miss something. After you have answered the easy questions (the ones you know you know), answer the ones you are less sure of, and ﬁnally answer the diﬃcult ones – since you will know everything the previous sentence is clearly unnecessary. Keep an eye on your watch at all times, and make sure you stick to your plan. Good luck with your exams! COS3751 lecturer(s) 2 Outline of syllabus 2.1 Chapter 1: Introduction Read as background. 2.2 Chapter 2: Intelligent Agents Familiarise yourself with the concepts and terminology. Make sure you can deﬁne the concepts in this chapter, and apply the deﬁnitions in diﬀerent scenarios. 2.3 Chapter 3: Solving Problems by Searching Study everything. You have to be able to formally deﬁne problems and apply the diﬀerent uninformed search strategies to these deﬁned problems. Thus you have to understand all the algorithms and be able to apply them to a given problem statement. You do not need to memorise any pseudo-code. You can omit entirely: Section 5.3: Memory- bounded heuristic search. 2.4 Chapter 4: Beyond Classical Search Study everything except the following sections, which you can omit entirely (they aren’t covered in the syllabus): ‹ Section 2: Local Search in Continuous Spaces ‹ Section 5: Online Search Agents and Unknown Environments 3 You have to understand all the algorithms and be able to apply them to a given problem statement. You do not need to memorise any pseudo-code. 2.5 Chapter 5: Adversarial Search Study sections 1, 2 and 3. You have to understand the minimax and alpha-beta algorithms, and be able to apply them to a given problem statement. Read sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. You have to understand the concepts covered in these sections, but you do not need to be familiar with any particular game such as backgammon, chess or any card game. 2.6 Chapter 6: Constraint Satisfaction Problems Study everything except the following section, which you can omit entirely: Section 5: The Structure of Problems (not covered in the syllabus). You have to understand all the algorithms and be able to apply them to a given problem statement. You do not need to memorise any pseudo-code. 2.7 Chapter 7: Logical Agents Many of the concepts introduced in this chapter should already be familiar to you from COS2661. However, there are some important algorithms in this chapter that you will probably not be familiar with. In particular, you have to understand and be able to apply forward and backward chaining as well as resolution. You also have to be able to use resolution refutation to prove a certain statement. Agents based on propositional logic are important. You may omit the DPLL and WALKSAT algorithms, and you may also omit section 6 (Eﬀective Propositional Model Checking). 2.8 Chapter 8: First-Order Logic Study everything, but you may omit section 4: Knowledge Engineering in First-Order Logic. 2.9 Chapter 9: Inference in First-Order Logic Study only sections 1, 2, 3, 4.1, and 5. You do not have to familiarize yourself with Prolog. 2.10 Chapter 18: Learning from Examples Understand the forms of learning and the concepts of supervised learning. You have to be able to construct a decision tree and reason with the contents thereof. You can omit the following sections: Sections 4 to 11. Make sure that you understand the solutions to the self assessment assignment provided in Tutorial Letter 203. Copyright © UNISA 2020 (v2020.1.0) 4","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
