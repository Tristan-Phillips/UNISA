In response to this charter, we have also placed curriculum transformation high on the agenda. For your information, curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both the programme and module levels, as a phased-in approach. You will notice the implementation thereof in your modules, and we encourage you to fully embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa. 1 INTRODUCTION Welcome to the Databases II (INF3703) module. We trust that you will find it interesting and rewarding. We shall do our best to make your study of this module successful. We recommend that you start studying early in the semester and that you resolve to do all the assignments and self-assessments as early as possible – and not at the last minute just before the assignment due dates. The assignments play a crucial role in preparing you for the final examination, which is the deciding factor in whether you will successfully pass the module or whether you will have to repeat the module. This module is currently being offered online. Only a few or no tutorial letters will be sent to you. Tutorial letters will be uploaded for you on myUnisa for easy and quick access. We shall therefore primarily use myUnisa for facilitating your learning and for supporting your final examination preparations. It is therefore important that you pay attention to all the announcements sent to you and the various self-assessments that will be posted on myUnisa. We urge you to read all the material available for this module and to ask when in doubt, either via the myUnisa discussion forums or via e-mail. Please refer to this tutorial letter and the learning units on myUnisa when working through the study material, preparing assignment(s), preparing for the examination and addressing questions to your lecturers. This tutorial letter provides all the information you need about the prescribed study material and other resources for this module. Please study this information carefully and make sure that you obtain the prescribed material as soon as possible. Take note of the preliminary examination dates and arrange for leave with your employer in good time if you are working full time. We hope that you will enjoy this module and wish you all the best. PLEASE NOTE THIS MODULE IS OFFERED ONLINE, THUS LIMITED TO NO PRINTED MATERIAL WILL BE SENT TO STUDENTS. myUnisa IS THE PRIMARY MEDIUM FOR ALL INTERACTION BETWEEN THE LECTURER AND STUDENTS.

We have not included this information in this tutorial letter as this information changes on a regular basis depending on a number of reasons. Nevertheless, a number of communication channels are at yo u r disposal to communicate with lecturers, namely myUnisa, e-mail, telephone and face-to-face interactions. E-mail is the preferred channel for normal queries as it enables a quick response to students. When contacting your lecturers via e-mail, please make sure that you quote your student number and compose your e-mail with a clear and specific subject related to your query. Please expect your lecturer to respond to your query at least within 48 hours. When calling the lecturers, please take note that they are usually available in their offices from 08:30 to 13:00. Should you prefer to meet the lecturer in person, you need to make an appointment with the lecturer concerned either via e-mail or telephone. The e-mail addresses for this module are as follows: INF3703-21-S1@unisa.ac.za (for students registered for semester 01) INF3703-21-S2@unisa.ac.za (for students registered for semester 02) All queries that are NOT of a purely administrative nature (e.g. registrations) but are about the contents of this module, should be directed to the lecturers of this module. All administrative queries should be directed to the relevant divisions (e.g. registrations). Please do not use the lecturing staff’s personal e-mail addresses – unless agreed upon with the lecturer concerned. The above addresses will ensure that your e-mail will be answered, even if a particular lecturer is not available. Generally, most students experience the same types of problems. In this tutorial letter, we shall address some of the most common student queries, so please take the time to read through this tutorial letter as some of the questions that you may have might be answered in this tutorial letter. We present you with a comprehensive first tutorial letter to assist you in the best possible way to ensure that you have effective interaction with the lecturers of this module and Unisa in general. Some of the worst frustrations that our students have experienced include:  problems that are still unresolved after an effort to contact Unisa  the fact that it is necessary to contact Unisa more than once to solve a problem  the fact that students are passed from one person to another when they call In this module, we shall try to reduce these frustrations to a minimum and to help you to spend time effectively on your studies. To make this possible, it is necessary for you to understand the general regulations and workflow within Unisa and how this affects us all.

Here are some of the questions (with their answers) that students repeatedly ask: Where can I get hold of a copy of the textbook? Carlos Coronel, Steven Morris, Keeley Crockett and Craig Blewett (2020). DATABASE PRINCIPLES: fundamentals of design, implementation, and Management (3th edition) is the new edition of the database textbook that the university uses. You are therefore advised to purchase the book as soon as possible. If the university’s bookstore does not have the book in stock, ask the shop to order it for you. The bookstore will contact you as soon as the book is available. If the university bookstore cannot assist you, call Undergraduate Student Affairs. This department communicates directly with the bookstores and will probably be able to persuade the bookstores to order new stock. Undergraduate Student Affairs might refer you to bookstores that have the book in stock. I have not received some of my study material. What should I do? The Dispatch Department is responsible for distributing printed material. If the study material took longer than expected to reach you, you can visit myUnisa and download the course material from there. How do I go about forming a study group? Students are encouraged to form study groups. This is quite easy if you regularly visit discussion forums and interact with other students. The lecturers may not distribute any personal information about any student. When will I get my assignment back? It takes between four and five weeks to mark an assignment. Only after this period it will be returned to you. If you have not received your assignment after this period, check the discussion forums to see whether there are any delays, or contact the Assignment Department. What mark did I receive for my assignment? As soon as your assignment has been marked, the mark you received will be displayed on the myUnisa system. The multiple-choice assignment marks will be available two to three weeks after the due date for the assignment. The marks for written assignments may take longer. Have you received my assignment? If you used myUnisa to upload your assignment, you should immediately see that the assignment is on the system, next to the applicable assignment in the assignment list. If not, re-enter your answers. If you used the postal system, check myUnisa after two to three days after submitting your assignment. If it is not on the system, make enquiries with the Assignment Department. If it was not received, you will have to resubmit it. What software package should I use to draw the diagrams? Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 You may use any software that you have access to. Microsoft Visio is probably the most popular, but you should be able to do most of the diagrams in Microsoft Power Point. 10 SOURCES CONSULTED Prescribe textbook - Carlos Coronel, Steven Morris, Keeley Crockett and Craig Blewett (2020).
