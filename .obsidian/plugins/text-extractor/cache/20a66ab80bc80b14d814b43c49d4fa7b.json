Usability goals are ef fective, efficiency , safety , utility , learnability and memorability It involves optimizing the interactions people have with interactive products to enable them to carry out their activities at work, at school, and in their everyday lives. 1.2 - User experience The user experience refers to how a product behaves and is used by people in the real world It is about how people feel about a product and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, holding it, and opening or closing it. It includes their overall impression of how good it is to use, right down to the sensual ef fect small details have on them, such as how smoothly a switch rotates or the sound of a click and the touch of a button when pressing it. An important aspect is the quality of the experience someone has, be it a quick one, such as taking a photo; a leisurely one, such as playing with an interactive toy; or an integrated one, such as visiting a museum 1.3 - Metaphors Interface metaphors are intended to provide familiar entities that enable people readily to understand the underlying conceptual model and know what to do at the interface 1.4 - Anthropomorphism Anthropomorphism is the propensity people have to attribute human qualities to animals and objects.Assignment 22 1.5 - Paradigm A paradigm refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices. -Q u e s tio n 2 Read the following hypothetical scenario and answer the following questions School of Computing have a small library , which is not associated with university’ s main library . The library has a collection of information systems, computer science textbooks and journals. The library uses excel spreadsheet to manage the library and the challenge is that when borrowers get books from the library , they return them late or sometimes never return them. The borrowers include students and all school of computing staf f. You have been approached by the School of Computing to design a library information system that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non-returned books are tracked 2.1 - As an interaction designer you are required to be part of a team that develops the library information systems application. What are the duties of an interaction designer ? → Designing interactive products to support people in their everyday and working lives 2.2 - Explain the phases of the Double Diamond of Design in the context of the library information systems. Use the phases to produce an initial design of the library information systems using one or more sketches to show the main functions and the general look and feel of the system. The fourth phase is omitted because you are not expected to produce the final productAssignment 23 Discover → Gather insight about problems What problems exist and how are users solving them within the current system Define → Develop a clear brief that frames the design challenge The library requires a clear way in which they can track the status of each book, either lent out or sitting in inventory as well as the current holder of said book Develop → Solutions or concepts are created, prototyped, testes and iterated Develop a library management system that allows for the librarian to keep track and hold record of current books being lent out, books past their return date, and books that are in inventory . While also being able to connect this information with a user “member”. Iterating through a few design prototypes Deliver → The resulting project is finalized, produced and launched Implement the system and start “real-world” testing In itia l D e s ig nAssignment 24 2.3 - Who are the potential stakeholders of library systems? Identify all of them The borrowers (Students and School staf f) The School of Computing library The organization developing the library management system 2.4 - What is the importance of involving users during the design of the system ? → Involving users in the design process assists with expectation management and feelings of ownership. As well as the design team being able to get immediate feedback to new or changed additions -Q u e s tio n 3 3.1 - What is a conceptual model? A model is a simplified description of a system or process that helps describe how it works. A conceptual model describes an abstraction, outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. The conceptual model is used by the design team as the basis from which they can develop more detailed and concrete aspects of the design. In doing so, design teams can produce simpler designs that match up with users’ tasks, allow Assignment 25 for faster development time, result in improved customer uptake, and need less training and customer support 3.2 - In point form, describe the four components that make up a conceptual model Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is used for and how to use it for an activity The concepts to which people are exposed through the product, including the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes and the operations that can be performed on them The relationships between those concepts The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke 3.3 - The use of a learning management system ( LMS ) creates more opportunities for learning in open distance learning, namely: content creation and sharing, student-student interaction, and student-teacher interaction. This promotes student engagement and improves student learning. The advantages of employing LMS can be summarized as : •Learners have access to online resources such as MOOCs (Accessibility) •Online services are easy to use for most students (Usability) •Learners can connect with other learners at anytime and anywhere (Connectivity) •Students can create, upload and share content (Content) •Students can have synchronous and asynchronous interactions with one another (Interaction) •LMS enables learner/teachers to give feedback ef ficiently (Feedback) As an interaction designer , draw a conceptual model of a learning management system platform. Y our conceptual model should reflect your experiences with myUNISA. The conceptual model should be simple and easy to understandAssignment 26 -Q u e s tio n 4 Download the T elegram App from the Play Store or any other store available on your mobile device and familiarize yourself Evaluate the current version of T elegram from the perspective of social interaction of distance learning students and discuss people’ s social disposition, the ideal of face-to-face conversations and the challenges in this regard, especially during the Covid-19 lockdown. Also discuss remote conversations and co-presence of distance learning students. S o c ia l D is p o s itio n → People have evolved to be social. Communication technologies assist people to be social even if they are not physically in each others presence → T elegram is great for communication with teachers and students. T ext, voice, video chat, and group chats are all available. Id e a l fa c e -to -fa c e c o n v e r s a tio n sAssignment 27 → In person conversations are preferable to talk in a chat room because it allows participants to see each other's body language and read cues like facial expressions. It also makes it easier to correct something if you realize that the message another person is receiving is dif ferent from what you had intended. → T elegram allows for face-to-face video group meetings. This is ideal for distance learning students as they can still communicate through telegram with inaudible, but visual, cues C h a lle n g e s fo r d is ta n c e e d u c a tio n d u r in g C o v id -1 9 lo c k d o w n → Distance education is more dif ficult because there is no group in one place. During the lockdown, smaller groups could not convene. → T elegram does not facilitate screen sharing, as such alternative software will be used for presentations and similar activities R e m o te c o n v e r s a tio n s → In remote conversations, it can be tough to make sure that people have the same understanding of what is being said. Sometimes people behave dif ferently when they're in person or on a call. → T elegram facilitates both audio and video group chats C o -p r e s e n c e → Co-presence refers to technologies that support collaboration between people who are working in the same physical space -Q u e s tio n 5 Do an emotional interaction evaluation of the current version of T elegram App. Download the T elegram App from the Play Store or any other store available on your mobile device and familiarize yourself. 5 .1 - How was the interface of the current version of T elegram designed to persuade users to use it ? Theory ApplicationAssignment 28 Theory Application Persuasive technologies are used to entice users to behave in a certain way . The messages sent through the telegram app are designed to make it attractive for users to reply . The user cannot review but can change a message once they have sent it. However , the interface is very neutral 5 .2 - Do you find the current interface of telegram believable and trustworthy , support your answer ? Theory Application A secure interface ensures privacy will enhance an apps trustworthiness The telegram interface does not use any deceptive methods to change the behavior of its users and lets users comment on its believability as a messaging app. 5 .3 - What annoys you on the design of the telegram interface? Motivate your answer Theory Application Frustrating, annoying or patronizing interfaces can make users angry and despondent as well as irksome, trying, complex, non-intuitive, etc .. It's possible to only pin 5 chats to the top of your contact’ s chat logs. If you have more frequent chats, it can be hard to find them as they may get lost in between all the other open chats. 5 .4 - Is the current version of T elegram aesthetically pleasing for South African users ? Motivate your answer Theory Application W ell designed animated icons, sound effects and vibrotactile feedback can be aesthetically pleasing for users. The current T elegram interface is very neutral. It provides a few options for customization, but the default look should work for most African users 5 .5 - Which technology(-ies) can be used by the app’ s owning company to detect users emotional state? Explain your answer Theory Application Cameras, Biosensors, sound evaluation, body movement detectors, eye tracking, etc … can be used to measure and analyze users emotional states based on their physical reactions Telegram can measure the user's reactions to content through their camera and microphone, with the permission of the user .Assignment 29 Q u e s tio n 6 6.1 - From the perspectives of Anthony Ortony model of emotional design, how do you design interactive products that invoke the visceral, behavioral and reflective senses . Reflective design is the ultimate level of Ortony’ s three-level model of emotional design. → At this stage we utilize data from both visceral and behavioral processing in sequence with out understanding and skills. Unlike the visceral and behavioral stages, reflective processing does no have immediate access to sensory data → Sensory data is sorted through and through the psyche stages of processing which af fect our perspective and ideas consequently The reflective design scheme is the biggest challenge for us as designers, because clients and users have dif ferent opinions, attitudes, memories and life experiences that are necessary when we make value judgments during meditation processing. To successfully enter the level of reflection, we need to explore what consumers want from our products, not only in terms of how they use them, but also how they fit and improve their lives. 6.2 - V isit the websites for UNISA, W its and UCT and comment on how the design of their websites’ main page (first page) satisfies each of the components of Anthony Ortony’ s model. Which websites persuade you to enroll at the university , support your answer?Assignment 210 V isceral Behavioral Reflective UNISA ✔ The website uses a good range of color ✖ The behavioral elements, such as buttons, are badly displayed and designed ✔ The website does a wonderful job at presenting towards an African citizen WITS ✖ The website color scheme, look and feel tend more towards that of a news reporting site than that of an academic website ✔ It is easy to interact with the elements on the website ✖ The website culture does not seem like a good representation of their target culture UCT ✔ The website feels like a traditional academic website ✔ Usability elements function as expected ✔ The website takes cultural elements into good consideration • V isceral design refers to making products look, feel, and sound good • Behavioral design is about use and equates to the traditional values of usability • Reflective design is about considering the meaning and personal value of a product in a particular cultureAssignment 211 → The website I would enroll in from my above assessment, would be either UCT or UNISA. UNISA because once you get through the rather unintuitive navigation and usability , it provides and of fers a rich experience that feels tailored to a distance learning student from South Africa UCT would be a consideration due to the cleanliness and ease of use of the website, however the rich feel of the South African culture is lacking somewhat within the website 6.3 - Based on the weaknesses that you identified from the above websites, design the front page of UNISA website with features that invokes the visceral emotions of students who seek to enroll at the university in 2023. Y ou can use any application to design a non-interactive main page (MS W ord, Powerpoint …or any other web editor). Focus on the design of the page not the functionality . Copy and paste the screenshot of the designed main page. Briefly describe how you incorporated the visceral component of Anthony Ortony model in the design of the website . → Incorporating the visceral component of the Anthony Ortony model, I made the ‘Registration’ more visible and made it stand out, allowing any first time user to immediately know how they could become one of the UNISA students and clearly signaling to the user that they can do all of this from the comfort of their homeAssignment 212 Q u e s tio n 7 In question 6, you recreated the main page of the UNISA website to improve user experience. Now you are now in the process of testing the user experience of the website : 7.1 - Who are the stakeholders of the website front page that you recreated ? Current and future students The designers of the website The University 7.2 - Explain the type of sampling that you would use to select the participants in your study ? Convenience sampling since the people who visit the website are most likely to be potential students or parents looking to enroll their children. 7.3 - Explain how each of the following data gathering techniques can be used to collect data when testing the website front page that you recreated . Technique Explanation Interview I will perform a user interview with the potential students who visited the website. After that with the website design team. Then with the University proof everything and suggest or recommend potential changes Questionnaire Set of questions including everything that is to be inquired by the different stakeholders for the main page recreation Observation W e will watch our potential students interact with the new main page. What do they like, love, hate and don't even notice? Based on the answers, we create a new questionnaire, then conduct interviews and continue the cycle 7.4 - Explain why consent forms are valuable when collecting data Consent forms are significant while gathering information. It involves the morals of the specialist and the client experience master and assessors. W e are informing information providers what we will do, and with their information and assuming that they are alright with everything, we go on with the overview 7.5 - List any 2 interview questions that you are going to use to collect data from studentsAssignment 213 1 . When visiting the website, what element first drew your attention ? 2 . How likely are you to enroll into the university after your initial contact with the website ? Q u e s tio n 8 School of Computing have a small library , which is not associated with university’ s main library . The library has a collection of information systems and computer science textbooks and journals. The library uses excel spreadsheet to manage the library and the challenge is that when borrowers get books from the library , they return them late or sometimes never return them. The borrowers include students and all school of computing staf f. You have been approached by the School of Computing to write a software program that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non- returned books are tracked 8.1 - Identify any two common types of requirements discovery in the context of the library system Functional Requirements Data Requirements 8.2 - Identify any 2 functional requirements of the library system Inventory management Customer relation management 8.3 - Choose one functional requirement of the library systems and present it as an atomic requirement. Use the V olere templateAssignment 214 8.4 - What are user stories ? User stories connect requirements among team members. They represent a component of customer-visible functionality and provides a starting point for a discussion to develop and simplify requirements. User stories can be used to obtain usability and user experience goals. 8.5 - Based on the functional requirement that you choose, express it as a user story As a < UNISA staff member > I want < to manage the inventory of books and their respective statuses > so that < I can correctly identify the status of each book and pull reports on overdue books > 8.6 - Based on the information of potential users, choose a user profile, and produce a persona and a scenario capturing how the user is expected to interact with the library systemAssignment 215 → Jack works for the school of computing’ s library . Until recently he had to use memory and excel spreadsheets to keep track of inventory and book statuses. Once the university implemented the new library management system, Jack is able to check in and out books while the system automatically assigns due dates and generates reports of the users with overdue books.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
