This is a year module offered by the School of Computing as from 2021. If you are repeating the module, please study this letter carefully, as there are changes from the semester module to the year module regarding examination admission. Because this is a fully online module, you will need to use myUnisa to study and complete the learning activities for this module. Visit the website for COS1521 on myUnisa frequently. The website for your module is COS1521-22-Y. This module provides you with a background to computers. Computers play such a major role in our daily lives that we accept their use as a matter of course. In COS1521 we introduce you to number systems, data storage and operations on data. Furthermore, the basics of logic gates and Boolean algebra will help you to draw simple combinational logic circuits when given a problem statement. We also investigate the fundamentals of sequential logic circuits. You will become better acquainted with numerous concepts and properties of the hardware and software components of computer systems. We explain the concept of software engineering and introduce you to concepts relating to data structures, databases and database management. We also look at the role that computers play in data communication in the modern world. This is an online module, so ALL learning content and ALL tutorial letters are available on myUnisa. As from 2021 you will not receive any tutorial matter in printed form.

COS1521/101/0/2022 5 2 OVERVIEW OF COS1521 2.1 Purpose COS1521 is one of a number of first-level Computer Science modules offered by the School of Computing at Unisa. The purpose of this module is to introduce you to the computer as a system. The module covers hardware concepts such as internal representation of numbers and characters and basic computer architecture, as well as software concepts such as systems software and applications software. It also includes a brief introduction to databases and to systems analysis and design. Qualifying students can apply the principles of computer systems, hardware and software to solve everyday computing problems through some fundamental introductory knowledge including historical developments, specific skills and underpinning values. This module will support further studies and applications in the sector of Computing, in the fields of Computer Science, Information Systems or Multimedia (either in a BSc, BCom or BA degree). These competencies can contribute to the expansion of the role of computers in the modern data communication world and as a component of an information system in an organisation. 2.2 Outcomes For this module, you will have to master several outcomes: Specific outcome 1 Demonstrate how data is represented, manipulated and stored in a computer by means of number systems, Boolean algebra, Karnaugh maps, truth tables and basic logic circuit drawings, in the context of given problem statements. Specific outcome 2 Demonstrate an understanding of the basic functions of computers, the software development process and units of hardware and software components. Specific outcome 3 Demonstrate an understanding of the basics of data communications and networks. Specific outcome 4 Describe data structures and how different databases function. 3 CURRICULUM TRANSFORMATION Unisa has implemented a transformation charter based on five pillars and eight dimensions. In response to this charter, we have placed curriculum transformation high on the teaching and learning agenda. Curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both programme and module levels as a phased- in approach. You will notice a marked change in the teaching and learning strategy implemented by Unisa, together with how the content is conceptualised in your modules. We 6 encourage you to embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa in a responsive way within the framework of transformation. 4 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 4.1 Lecturer(s) The primary lecturer for this module is Ms Drina du Plessis Department: School of Computing Telephone: 011 670 9109 / 0607666031 E-mail: dpleshw@unisa.ac.za Whenever you contact a lecturer via e-mail, please include your student number in the subject line to enable the lecturer to help you more effectively. 4.2 Department You can contact the School of Computing as follows: Telephone number: 011 670 9200 E-mail: computing@unisa.ac.za 4.3 University To contact the University, follow the instructions on the Contact us page on the Unisa website.

This is also true for first-time students to Unisa. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e-learning institution. Unlike face-to-face/contact institutions, Unisa is somewhat different. It is a mega university and all our programmes are offered through a blended learning mode or fully online learning mode. It is for this reason that we thought it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support so that you can seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. In this regard we offer a specialised student support programme to students entering Unisa for the first time. We refer to this programme as Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme. The FYE is designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE programmes are currently offered: • FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE • FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated. • FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (eg videos on how to submit assignments online). • FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e-mail to fye@unisa.ac.za 6.2 E-tutors With effect from 2013, Unisa offers online tutorials (e-tutoring) to students registered for modules at NQF level 5, 6 and 7, this means qualifying undergraduate modules. Once you have been registered for a qualifying module, you will be allocated to a group of students with whom you will be interacting during the tuition period as well as with an e-tutor who will be your tutorial facilitator. Thereafter you will receive an sms informing you about your group, the name of your e-tutor and instructions on how to log onto myUnisa in order to receive further information on the e-tutoring process. Online tutorials are conducted by qualified e-tutors who are appointed by Unisa and are offered free of charge. All you need to be able to participate in e-tutoring is a computer with internet connection. If you live close to a Unisa regional center, please feel free to visit this center to access the internet. E-tutoring takes place on myUnisa where you are expected to connect with other students in your allocated group. It is the role of the e-tutor to guide you through your study material during this interaction process. To get the most out of online tutoring, you need to participate in the online discussions that the e-tutor will be facilitating. Please make use of this opportunity. The e-tutor is also available if you need any help with questions from old exam papers – post your questions on the discussion forum of your e-tutor group, and the e-tutor and your fellow students will comment and assist. There are modules that students have been found to repeatedly fail, these modules are allocated face-to-face tutors and tutorials for these modules take place at the Unisa regional 12 centers. These tutorials are also offered free of charge, however, it is important for you to register at your nearest Unisa regional center to secure attendance of these classes. 6.3 Free computer and internet access Unisa has entered into partnerships with establishments (referred to as Telecentres) in various locations across South Africa to enable you (as a Unisa student) free access to computers and the Internet. This access enables you to conduct the following academic related activities: registration; online submission of assignments; engaging in e-tutoring activities and signature courses; etc. Please note that any other activity outside of these is for your own costing e.g. printing, photocopying, etc. For more information on the Telecentre nearest to you, please visit www.unisa.ac.za/telecentres. 7. HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 7.1 What does it mean to study fully online? Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa. • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office. • All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you via e-mail and SMS, and use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these platforms to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 7.2 myUnisa tools The main tool that we will use is the Lessons tool. This tool will provide the content of and the assessments for your module. The lessons contain many videos that you may watch, should you battle to understand certain concepts in the textbook. Please note that these videos are not compulsory to watch, and that you will not be examined on them. However, they are quite helpful if you need to refresh your memory about specific topics in the textbook. It is very important that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you log in at least once a week to do the following: • Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife e-mail account so that you receive the announcement e-mails on your cellphone. • Do the Discussion Forum activities. When you do the activities for each lesson, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you will need to go online to post your messages. Your e-tutor will post the activities on the Discuusion Forum. COS1521/101/0/2022 13 • Do other online activities. For some of the lesson activities you might need to complete a Self-Assessment exercise. Do not skip these activities because they will help you complete the assignments and the activities for the module. We hope that by giving you extra ways to study the material and practise all the activities, this will help you succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module, you MUST go online regularly to complete the activities and assignments on time. 8.

This means that your final mark is based not only on your examination mark, but also on your performance during the year. Assignments do not only provide you with an opportunity to evaluate your understanding of the prescribed material (or to give you feedback on your readiness for the examination), but also make a contribution towards your year mark. COS1521/101/0/2022 17 You will be awarded a year mark based on the percentages you achieve for Assignments 01 to 04. The year mark will contribute 20% towards your final mark for this module. You have to submit at least one assignment by the due date of assignment to obtain exam admission. Contribution percentages are as follows: Assignment 01: 20% Assignment 02: 30% Assignment 03: 30% Assignment 04: 20% We illustrate by an example. Assume that you marks for the assignments are as follows: Assignment 01: 70% Assignment 02: 80% Assignment 03: 50% Assignment 04: 60% Your year mark will be calculated as follows: (70 × 0.2) + (80 × 0.3) + (50 x 0.3) + (60 x 0.2) = 65%, Now suppose you achieve an exam mark of 70%. Your final mark will be calculated as follows: (65 × 0.20) + (70 × 0.80)% = (13.0 + 56.0)% = 69%. Please note that your year mark will not be taken into consideration if you are writing a supplementary exam. If myUnisa is down on the last submission date, the DSAA and lecturers will be notified. Try to resubmit the assignment as soon as myUnisa is up again. Please do not contact lecturers if a problem of this kind occurs, since system problems will be taken into consideration. If you have queries with regards to the submission of assignments, please contact the Assignments section of the DSAA.
