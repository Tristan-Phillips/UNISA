Means: If NOT crashed, then braked. If NOT braked, then Crashed. Say we let Q be ‘applied the breaks’ and P be ‘you crash’ Then Unless Q, then P If NOT P, then Q If NOT Q, then P Sequent structure: How to show if a sequent is valid or not valid: A valuation of a formula is an assignment of each propositional atom to a truth table.  Identify the premises and the conclusion  Construct a truth table showing the truth values of the premises and the conclusion  Look for all the rows where the premises are all true - we call such rows critical rows. If the conclusion is false in a critical row, then the argument Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace is invalid. Otherwise, the argument is valid (since the conclusion is always true when the premises are true). e.g. HORN formula steps are: 1. Mark all T’s true if it occurs in the list 2. If everything on the left of the → is marked then mark the right as well and also mark all instances of what was on the right and then go to step 2 again. Otherwise go to 3. 3. If contradiction is marked then Horn formula is unsatisfiable. Otherwise go to 4. 4. Print out Horn formula is satisfiable and stop. e.g. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Step 1: Step 2: Step 2: Step 2: Step 3: Contradiction is marked, thus Horn formula is not satisfiable. Terms and WFF (Well formed formulas): Variables, constants and functions are terms. Well formed formulas (WFF) To be well formed Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace  statements inside the brackets needs to be a term (variables, constants or functions)  variables can’t stand alone without a capital letter/predicate. E.g. y instead of P(y)  Not all variables need to be bound by a quantifier, i.e. a well formed formula can have free variables.  Can’t use constant with quantifiers  WFF must have a predicate in them to be a WFF. e.g. Note you also have to take into account the information given like Q, S and P are predicates with 2 variables. If they give those predicates with one argument then it is not well formed. Answers: i) Not a WFF, because a quantifier can’t be inside the brackets of a predicate. ii) Not a WFF, because a predicate can’t be inside another predicated brackets. iii) It is a WFF. iv) Not a WFF, because you can’t have quantifiers with constants. v) Not a WFF (You are not allowed to have variable without predicate) Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Natural deduction Rules: Disjunction elimination  We have 2 sub proofs Disjunction Introduction If P is present then you can deduce that Universal Quantifier Elimination: Example: Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace - WE assume variable inside block. - Anywhere in this block we allowed to eliminate with the variables becoming the variable chosen. WORDING: If it is true for any variable then it must be true for a certain variable. Universal quantifier introduction: Example: - Introduce a variable - Then if we find a WFF for that variable then we can introduce for that WFF. - Note the introduction happens outside the block where you introduced the variable. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace We say for any arbiter variable chosen and we find that a WFF is true, then WFF must be true for all variables Existential quantifier introduction: Example: - If you have WFF with a variable inside the block then you can introduce inside the block for that WFF. - It can be introduced outside the block as well Here we saying that if an variable exist for WFF then it is true for some (∃) variable. Existential quantifier elimination This is the longest one. Example: Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Note: - You make an assumption of premise (or statement) that you want to remove by replacing variable with arbitrary variable. Black arrow in picture - Then from the assumption you get to any WFF. Blue line in picture Then you allowed to introduce that WFF using elimination rule. Red line in picture. Example showing proof by contradiction and also how to do negation elimination. i.e. contradiction intro. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace For proof by contradiction you need to assume the opposite you want to prove. So we want to prove ‘q’ so we assumed ‘¬q’. Then we proved a contradiction which allowed us to introduce q. Another way of using contradiction is : Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Here when we arrived at a contradiction we allowed to introduce anything. Conditional introduction Proof: You assume left side of the → and then you prove the right side which allows you to introduce it. Rules box intro and box elim: No rules for ♢, thus you have to convert it using ♢ = ¬☐¬ Note: Cannot do before . SO 1st do box elim to do box intro. If you have eliminated box somewhere and at the end you can prove Φ then you can introduce box to Φ. Only allowed to use BOX intro if you have used BOX elim WE say: If it has be proved for Φ then Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace If you are given box somewhere then you can just eliminate it. We say that if Agent knows Φ then in the scope of the agent Φ is true. The dotted line represents the scope of the agent. Example: Only allowed to use BOX intro if you have used BOX elim Axiom rules that you can use: The top ones are replaced by the bottom ones. These rules state: Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace - When you have a box you can either remove it (T stands for Take it away) or add another box (4) - When you have negation Box then you can add another box (5) infront of it Parse tree We will explain with an example: Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Parse tree: Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace The next image explains why variables are free and why they are bound: Explanation: If you go up the path then for the x you will reach a quantifier with an x attached to it. But for y you will not reach a quantifier that has a y attached to it. Example explaining if a function is free for a variable in Φ Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace This question asks us can we replace free occurring y’s with f(x). No, because f(x) is not free for y in Φ, since f(x) becomes bound upon introduction. Explanation: Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace See if you replace the y with a function of y then it will be bound by the top quantifier since the quantifier has an x attached to it and the function is a function of x. These only apply to parse trees if there isn’t brackets: The highest precedence to the least (Most bound to least bound): ¬, ∀, ∃ ᴧ v → ↔ So if you have the expression: p ᴧ q → r v s ↔ q Then to put brackets around this you start with the most binding and work your way to the least binding: 1. (p ᴧ q) → r v s ↔ q 2. (p ᴧ q) → (r v s) ↔ q 3. ((p ᴧ q) → (r v s)) ↔ q Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Models Types of models:  Mathematical Model -> Functions  Arithmetic -> Number sets  Non Arithmetic -> Non number sets like people and stuff like that Unary predicates -> descriptive, i.e. describing a set. E.g. S(x) n-ary predicates -> -relational (compare) . e.g. Q(x,y) -Functional Meaning if I put something in something else comes out. E.g. x input then y outputs. x,y,z, etc. are variables. Using symbols/predicates we can specify a meaning for them: Note that names are not important, e.g. : So for models we are given the symbols, variables and a WFF and then we have to give meaning to it. i.e. we are given and we have to give meaning (maybe ) to either make the model true or false. Examples of models: e.g. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace You read this as if 2 elements are related to each other then they are not related to themselves. The will ensure that x and y are compared but they are not equal. i.e. one will always be bigger than the other one. This would then say if x is greater than y than x is not great to itself AND y is not greater to itself. The model says: All positive integers cannot be greater than themselves. Or another solution: This would say if x-y is not equal to 0 then x minus itself is NOT not equal to 0, i.e. it is equal to 0 AND y minus itself is equal to 0. Now for non-mathematical model with values a,b,c It works since it says a and b is related to one another and b and c are related to one another BUT a is not related to itself, b is not related to itself and c is not related to itself. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace ii) proving they not valid we changed x = y Or also since if both they are 1 then x and y will be equal which is not allowed. You can give counter example to prove why it is not working. For non-mathematical model: Example: i) Mathematical model: Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace This says that for all positive integers if there is a integer say b which is bigger than another integer (say a) and also there is another integer bigger than b (say c) then c is bigger than a. Non-mathematical model ii) Mathematical model: Counter example: Say y =4, then x = 8, then z = ±sqrt(4) = ±2. Then x = z^2 = x=(±2)^2 ≠ 8 OR: Non-mathematical model Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Example: If x is related to y then x is related to a function of y. i) So a function of y can be: X is related to a function of y: 1: y = x+1 and 2: f(y) = y +1, Sub 1 in 2: f(y) = x+1 +1 so now here x is related to a function of y. SO function needs to be reversible basically ii) This doesn’t work since the function is not reversible. Also if you put negative 1 in x then y is omcplex number and we only dealing with integers e.g. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace A = set of all real numbers 𝑆𝑀 = S(a,b) = a is smaller than b. Here we gave S the meaning Smaller than. This works for both. : It works for this because it says if x is smaller than y and y is smaller than z THEN x is smaller than z. TRUE : It works for this one because it says x is not smaller than x which is True. e.g. e.g. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace e.g. e.g. You can transform this to: They saying if this exist, Px, then all of them are that. Also say if y is the input then it leads to some z. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace If we have P as integers this says: If there exist an integer in the universal set then all elements are integers (THIS IS FALSE) OR if we plug all intgeres into a formula we get some z which is also an elements of the universal set. So the formula if you plug in integers and square it then it will become z and zet will be real number so it is true. Model that doesn’t work: Does not work since if y is -4 then z is complex number which is not a part of the universal set. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Modal logic We introduce two new connectives (connectives are like v or →): ☐ which means necessarily true. This means it is guaranteed to happen. FOR THE Purpose OF UNDERSTANDING IT BETTER WHEN WORDING IT OUT instead of necessarily use DEFINITELY. True for all cases. ♢ which means possibly true. This means it might happen. There only have to be one case where it can be true/happen. Important rules to know: Note: With these you will have to transform modal logic formulas into English and transform them from English into modal logic formulas. e.g. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace i) Change it using the rule: Note: Sometimes you have to change the formulas using the rules. If it is necessarily true that John takes an umbrella, then it is necessarily true that the weather isn’t bad ii) q ᴧ ♢p Formula schemes: Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Note: They will ask you to say whether it is valid for a certain types of meanings of box and diamond and then you have to explain. These are very difficult to explain and also there isn’t a lot of these in the exams (only 6 marks) so I suggest to leave them out. Agent modal logic: 𝐾𝑖 = “Agent I knows that” Note difference between Agent 1 does not know p: ¬𝐾1𝑝 Agent 1 knows not p: 𝐾1¬𝑝 Example: i) Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace If all the agents knows not q, then either Agent 3 or Agent 4 knows p. ii) 𝐾1𝐾2(pᴧq) v 𝐾3𝐾4(pᴧq) Kripke Models If we have x ☐p then this says: All worlds that x goes to must contain p. (i.e. all world that x points to must contain a p for that to be true) If we have x ♢ p then this says: AT least one world that x goes to (or points to) must contain p. Note: So if you have ☐ or ♢ then you look at other worlds (i.e. worlds that is being pointed to. E.g. x ♢ p here we will look at the worlds that world x points to (so other worlds than x) BUT If you have something like this: then you look at the world itself. Here it asks us do x1 contain ‘p’ and a ‘q’? Lets look at examples which will make things more clear: Examples: e.g. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace So we have ♢¬p. So it means which world contains at least 1 path that goes to a world that contains ¬p (not a p). ♢ means at least 1. So x1 it goes to a world that does not contain a ‘p’. x2 goes to a world that does not contain a p. x4 there is a world which it goes to which does not contain a p. (remember ♢ means at least) Even though it does go to a world that does contain a P. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace So options 1, 2 and 3 are correct. So option 4 should have said all of the above cause all of options 1,2 and 3 are correct. e.g. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Option 1: This says all worlds that x1 points (or goes to) to must contain a p. It is FALSE. X1 points to x2 and x2 do not contain a p. Option 2: It says all worlds that x2 points to contain a p and a q. FALSE Option 3: Says all worlds that x3 point to contain a ‘p’ AND(ᴧ) at least one of the worlds that x3 points to must contain a q. 1st part: All worlds that x3 point to contain a ‘p’ : This part is true since it doesn’t go to any world (with ☐ if the world don’t point to any worlds then it is automatically true) OR you can’t give counter example to disprove it. 2nd part: at least one of the worlds that x3 points to must contain a q: This part is false since it says there needs to exist at least 1 world that contains a q that x3 is pointing towards and there isn’t . So False ᴧ True = False Option 4: Correct e.g. Note: Here we don’t have any references to any worlds. What the question is asking if each option would be true for all worlds. A formula is true for a model if it satisfies all it worlds. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace 1: So we have to see if ♢p satisfies all the worlds, i.e. does each world at least point to 1 world which contains a ‘p’. False, since x1 doesn’t point to at least 1 world containing a p 2: For each world is it true that all worlds that it point to must contain a q? False, since x1 points to x2 and x2 doesn’t contain a q. 3: This one says if the world contain q then it will/must contain p. False, example is x3. IT contain q, but doesn’t contain p. 4: Correct Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Downloaded by: YeNahGetThat | likewise52@protonmail.com Distribution of this document is illegal","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
