Seiden (2016) Lean UX, 2nd edition, O’Reilly. Aligning work practices • Designing a complete product upfront causes problems because of re-prioritisation • Some upfront work is needed (technical & UX) • Use a parallel tracks approach: – create product vision before development starts – do design work one iteration ahead of development – some teams work two iterations ahead www.id-book.com 8 Parallel tracks approach to AgileUX www.id-book.com 9 Source: Sy, D. (2007) Adapting usability investigations for development, Journal of Usability Studies 2(3), May, 112–130. User Experience Professionals Association Aligning work practices • Advantages of parallel tracks approach: – no design time wasted on features not implemented – usability testing and contextual inquiry could be done on the same customer visit, saving time – timely feedback on the designs was received from developers and customers – Agile flexibility supports schedule changes if a problem is found • Parallel tracks is commonly used www.id-book.com 10 Documentation • Common communication approach for UX designers • Agile encourages minimal documentation so more time can be spent on design and discussion • Only use documentation where needed. Ask: – Can the amount of time spent on documentation be reduced? – Who uses documentation? – What is the minimum needed by customers? – How efficient is the sign-off process? – Is there duplication anywhere? – How polished does documentation need to be? www.id-book.com 11 Documentation: how polished? www.id-book.com 12 Source: Ratcliffe, L. and McNeill, M.

Design Patterns • Capture design experience: – a solution to a problem in a context – can be instantiated in many ways: generative • Patterns may be individual, in languages, in catalogues, galleries or libraries • Patterns often are associated with software components, e.g. Github or platform websites • Carousel pattern as example: www.id-book.com 14 Design Patterns www.id-book.com 15 Design Patterns • Capture design experience, but that doesn’t necessarily mean good design: – anti-patterns: don’t do it this way! – dark patterns: deliberate tricks www.id-book.com 16 Open Source Resources • Components, frameworks, systems available free of charge • Community-driven • Available for interaction design: – design pattern libraries – Bootstrap framework www.id-book.com 17 Open Source Resources www.id-book.com 18 Source: Didier Garcia/Larson Associates Tools for Interaction Design • Tools support all aspects of the design process: – creativity, sketching, simulation, brainstorming, library search, mindmapping, video capture • Tools integrate together to speed up prototyping • Tooling landscape changes all the time • Interactive wireframes or mockups can be produced using, e.g. – Moqup© – Balsamiq© – Axure© • Higher fidelity prototypes can be produced by linking interactive wireframes to design pattern library with software components www.id-book.com 19 Summary • AgileUX refers to approaches that integrate UX design and agile development – needs a balance between research and reflection, and rapid iterations – requirements are repeatedly re-prioritised, which aims to avoid wasted effort – UX design activities need careful planning: when, how much, and how to take forward • Design patterns and implementation libraries support good user experience design • Open source resources, e.g. on Github, make development of standard applications easier and quicker • A range of automated tools to support interaction design in practice is available www.id-book.com 20","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
