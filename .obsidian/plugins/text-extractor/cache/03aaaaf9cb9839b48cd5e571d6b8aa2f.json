Word of Welcome - Welcome to tutorials for MAT1503. Unisa recognizes the importance of tutorials as one way we can provide you with quality teaching to increase your chances of succeeding in your studies. In order to make it easier for you to take advantage of the tutorials, you have the choice of attending tutorials in face-face classes at the learning center, or participating in e-tutoring on myUnisa. Before you start your tutorials, please read carefully through this Tutorial Resource and through Tutorial Letter 101 for MAT1503. The Tutorial Resource contains the week-by-week activities which you will go through in the tutorials. The activities are designed to pace your studies in order to help you to complete your assignments, and to prepare you for the final examination. Remember, this tutorial resource does not replace your study guide for module MAT1503, but complements it by providing interactive activities around the more difficult concepts in the module. Under MAT1503/102 5 the guidance of your tutor, you will go through some of the activities on your own, and some in collaboration with your fellow students. Please use the resource with close reference to other study materials in your study pack. It is important for you to understand the rules and your responsibilities with regard to the tutorials and to your assessment. We wish you the best in your studies, and hope that the tutorials will enrich your learning experience. Signed…………………Ali ZA IDRISS ……………………… Dr ZI. Ali Lecturer for MAT1503 MAT1503/102 6 5. Word of caution Your choice to study by distance is commendable because of the many advantages that studying by distance offers to you. However, although studying through distance learning should motivate you to learn to study independently, independent study may not be easy for you. Studying alone can at times be indeed a lonely experience, which may affect your success. This is because in the distance education environment, minimal, yet vital interaction takes place between yourself and your lecturers and between yourself and other students in the same module. This is the main reason why we consider tutorials as a vital element of your learning. Tutorials give you the opportunity to interact with others to exchange knowledge, with guidance by a mentor who understands the subject. You must therefore make every effort to participate in the tutorials. Please note also that tutors mark your assignments, discuss the feedback with you, and use the formative assessment to help you to prepare for the final examination. Therefore, given also that the assignments contribute 20% to your final mark, it is extremely important that you participate in the tutorials and seize every opportunity to get assistance from the tutor. Before and during each tutorial, ask yourself the following questions;  Have I prepared adequately for the tutorial by reading around the subject?  Have I thought critically about my question or comment before I post it on myUnisa or before I pose it to others in a face-face class?  Will I or have I completed (at the prescribed times) all the activities that are linked to the tutorial?  Am I willing to share information, and not shy to engage in conversation with others?  Am I using the correct language to communicate by writing or speaking formally, and not using shorthand or slang?  Will I be known by others in the tutorial group for being a critical thinker?  Will I be known by others to be respectful and considerate of their opinions? 6. The choice between face-face and e-tutoring In this module, we have given you the choice to attend face-face tutorials which are delivered by a tutor at a learning centre, or to participate in e-tutorials on myUnisa. You can opt for face-face or e-tutoring, or both. However, we strongly recommend that you opt for e-tutoring for the following reasons;  Face-face tutors are not always available for the module at all centers, particularly at the small centers.  There may be very few students to constitute a meaningful tutorial group, particularly in the small learning centers. MAT1503/102 7  Online tutorials have large groups with more interactive opportunities and access to online resources.  Online tutorials give you flexible access times.  It is easier, quicker and more secure to complete and submit your assignment on the online platform.  Upon registration, you are automatically allocated to an e-tutorial group, which gives you more time to be active in the tutorials. On the other hand, you have to book for face-face tutorials by completing the tutorial booking form (Annexure 1) and submitting at the Unisa learning centre nearest to you, or book online on http/www.f2ftutorialbooking… 7. Time Frames for tutorials One of the reasons why MAT1503 is offered over a year is to create ample time for you to access tutorials. Tutorials are delivered over a period of 30-40 weeks during the year, depending on the date on which you register for the module (for online tutorials) and on the date on which you enrol for tutorials at a learning centre. Once a tutorial site is created on myUnisa, e-tutorials are open all the time, although the tutor is only live on specific days and times, depending on availability. Depending on the subject content of the tutorial, a tutorial session typically takes approximately 2-3 weeks in an e-tutorial. You can be on the tutorial site myUNISA at any time. However, you are encouraged to maintain a regular presence on myUnisa (even if sometimes you do not do much more than browse through announcements and, or other students’ conversations). The ideal is to spend an average of 2-3 hours per week on myUnisa MAT1503/102 8 8. Navigating through the tutorial resource Figure 1 shows the structure of a tutorial session. Figure 1: Structure of a tutorial Different icons are used to guide you through the different activities in a tutorial (Figure 2). The purpose of each segment of the tutorial is also explained. It is important that you understand the importance and purpose of each activity in the tutorial so that you can plan to make the best of each experience. Once you are used to the tutorial routine, you will find it easy to follow the tutorial schedule, which is important for you to prepare for the tutorials according to the different activities. Ice breaker This icon draws your attention to a social activity which is intended to loosen you and warm you up to the discussion.

Figure 2: Signposts used for navigation through the tutorials 9. Guidelines for online participation and netiquette In order for the tutorials to be effective, exciting and meaningful, we all need to follow certain ground rules. Before starting on tutorials, the tutor will ask you to discuss and agree on a set of rules to be followed by everybody in the group. This is important for the tutorials to be a pleasant and useful experience for everyone. We refer to good behavior in tutorials as netiquette. You must therefore sincerely to commit to the netiquette, and respect it at all times! Misconduct during tutorials can lead to expulsion from the tutorial group. MAT1503/102 10 Commitment by the student During tutorials, I undertake to do my best to; Share information with others. Prepare to engage in meaningful discussions with others by prior study around the concept. Complete all the recommended learning activities within the prescribed times. Attend 75 % of the face-face tutorials or maintain a regular presence on myUnisa, an average of 3-4 hours per week Pose at least three relevant questions in each face-face class or post at least one question or comment in appropriate sites every time I visit the tutorial site on myUnisa Respect the university policy on communication which, (among other things) encourages the use of appropriate language, courtesy and respect for others. Commitment by the Tutor During Tutorials, I undertake to do my best to; Nurture your independent and group learning skills Create and maintain a friendly learning environment Respond to your questions within 48 hours Respect the confidentiality of any personal information Conduct assessment without fear or favour Respect the university policy on communication In addition, for our mutual benefit, each of us needs to participate actively and make meaningful contributions during the tutorials. If you prefer online tutorials, your participation is considered satisfactory only if you are active in 75% of all discussions and complete the same percentage of the compulsory related learning MAT1503/102 11 activities and tasks. A minimum of 3 postings per discussion, plus responses to a minimum of 3 other students are required for a student to be recorded as active in a discussion. If you opt to attend face-face tutorials, your participation is considered satisfactory only if you attend with participation in a minimum of 30 (75%) of the 40 hours allocated for tutorial in the module. You also need to complete the same percentage of the learning activities and tasks as students in the e-tutorials. During the tutorials, always reflect on whether you are meeting your obligations as a member of a learning community. Table 1 provides a summary of these obligations; your tutor will explain more on what you need to do during the tutorials. Table 1: Active Participation in tutorials MAT1503/102 12 Focus of the tutorial Actions that describe meaningful participation in the tutorial Foundation content Foundation content is meant to refresh the basic knowledge you may need to understand higher concepts. Do not assume you know, read though all the recommended resources and test yourself using the self-assessment exercises. Remember, it is important to read and understand additional resources for you to score high in the journal of tutorial reflections. Common mistakes misconceptions Identifying the common mistakes and misconceptions around a concept helps to ensure that everybody in the tutorial group starts off at the same level of understanding. Clearing misconceptions and avoiding common mistakes helps us to narrow discussions to key issues, and thereby accelerate learning. Therefore, before each tutorial, clear your mistakes and any misconceptions using the list provided. Thereafter, be prepared to make other mistakes or expose other misconceptions. Others may in fact share the same, and you can help each other in correcting them. Frequently asked questions (FAQ) Identifying the FAQ around a concept similarly helps to ensure the tutorial group starts off at the same level of understanding. Clearing your question against the list of FAQ also saves tutorial time. Before you ask a question, clear it by looking at the FAQ. We encourage you to ask questions in the public domain in the hope that it may help others too. However, questions you may not feel comfortable to ask in an open discussion such as in a face-face class or in the discussions forums on myUnisa can be asked in private consultations with a face-face tutor, or by posting in the Q & A tool on myUnisa. Discussions Read around before engaging in a discussion so that you can engage in meaningful conversations with others. In the discussions on myUnisa, posting your own topics [only when invited to open a discussion topic] is a good way to direct the discussion in your favour. Expressing your comments or opinions allows the tutor to identify gaps in your knowledge. The tutor does not always give you a straight answer, but will ask you probing or prompting questions to help you to think through the question. Stay on a discussion until it’s closed by the tutor. Be known as a critical thinker. Remember, it is important for you to make the required minimum number of contributions in each discussion for you to score high in the journal of tutorial reflections. Assignments & feedback As a rule, except if they are group activities, assignments are not discussed before the due date, but after. Once the discussion on an assignment is open, look critically at the feedback to your assignments regardless of the mark you get, and ask more questions if necessary. The tutor will always probe your mastery of concepts through more questions. Self-assessment/ Learning activities Do as many of the learning activities provided in the tutorials as possible. Do them as well as if you are doing an assignment. This helps the tutor to identify knowledge gaps and to suggest appropriate additional learning activities tailor-made to address your specific needs. Remember, it is important to do the activities diligently for you to score high in the journal of tutorial reflections. Reflection on the tutorial session Do not go out of a tutorial session with unanswered questions. Use the checklist, and further test your knowledge in the reflective discussions with your peers. Additional (including online) learning resources Look at all recommended learning resources and take notes. It is important to read and understand all the resources recommended for further reading for you to score high in the journal of tutorial reflections MAT1503/102 13 We believe the tutorials are most meaningful if members of the group all believe in the power of interactive or collaborative learning; 1The Power of Interactive Learning What I hear, I forget. What I hear and see, I remember a little. What I hear, see, and ask questions about or discuss with someone else I begin to understand. What I hear, see, discuss, and do, I acquire knowledge and skill. What I teach to another, I master.” 1 Silberman, M. 1996. Active learning: 101 Strategies to Teach any Subject. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. MAT1503/102 14 10. Tutorial Sessions This section onwards contains your tutorials. The resource contains an orientation session, [inset number] subject-based tutorial sessions, and an exam preparation session. Please note that the module MAT1503 is very important and practical. The module is an introduction of linear algebra which is an indispensable tool in many areas of science. To make it a real-life learning experience and therefore make easier for you to master the practical skills, the tutorials are designed to assist you to apply the knowledge on practical level. The tutorial resource is therefore structured around questions from a recommended book. 10.1 Orientation 10.1.1 Tutorial 0: Orientation – Linear Algebra [1 = weeks)] [2 = hours) Ice breaker Introduce yourself, and tell us the following things about yourself: 1.
