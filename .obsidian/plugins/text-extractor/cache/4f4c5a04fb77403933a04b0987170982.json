The comprehensiveness of our curricula encapsulates a range of offerings, from strictly vocational to strictly academic certificates, diplomas and degrees. Unisa's \"openness\" and its distance eLearning character result in many students registering at Unisa who may not have had an opportunity to enrol in higher education. Our CODeL character implies that our programmes are carefully planned and structured to ensure success for students ranging from the under-prepared but with potential to the sufficiently prepared. Teaching and learning in a CODeL context involve multiple modes of delivery ranging from blended learning to fully online. As a default position, all post graduate programmes are offered fully online with no printed study materials, while undergraduate programmes are offered in a blended mode of delivery where printed study materials are augmented with online teaching and learning via the learner management system – myUnisa. In some instances, undergraduate programmes are offered fully online as well. Furthermore, our programmes are aligned with the vision, mission, and values of the University. Unisa's commitment to serve humanity and shape futures combined with a clear appreciation of our location on the African continent, Unisa's graduates have distinctive graduate qualities which include • independent, resilient, responsible, and caring citizens who are able to fulfil and serve in multiple roles in their immediate and future local, national and global communities • having a critical understanding of their location on the African continent with its histories, challenges and potential in relation to globally diverse contexts • the ability to critically analyse and evaluate the credibility and usefulness of information and data from multiple sources in a globalised world with its ever- increasing information and data flows and competing worldviews • how to apply their discipline-specific knowledges competently, ethically and creatively to solve real-life problems • an awareness of their own learning and developmental needs and future potential The INF1511 module is online (all information is available via the internet). We use myUnisa as our virtual campus. This is an online system that is used to administer, document and deliver educational material to you and support engagement with you. Look out for information from your lecturer as well as other Unisa platforms to determine how to access the virtual myUnisa module site. Information on the tools that will be available to engage with the lecturer and fellow students to support your learning will also be communicated via various platforms. Because this is a fully online module, you will need to use myUnisa to study and complete the learning activities for this module. Visit the website for INF1511 on myUnisa frequently. The website for your module is INF1511-23-Y. We wish you every success with your studies! INF1511/101/0/2023 5 2 MODULE OVERVIEW 2.1 Purpose Qualifying students as first-time programmers obtain introductory knowledge, skills, and competencies to apply visual programming concepts, techniques and strategies using problem solving, programming logic, as well as the design techniques of an object-oriented, event-driven language, Python.

This is also true in the case of students enrolling at Unisa for the first time. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e- learning institution, and it is very different from face-to-face/contact institutions. It is a mega university, and all our programmes are offered through either blended learning or fully online learning. It is for this reason that we thought it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support to help them seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. We therefore offer a specialised student support programme to students enrolling at Unisa for the first time – this is Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme, designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE services are currently offered: • FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE • FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated. • FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (e.g. videos on how to submit assessments online). • FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e- mail to fye@unisa.ac.za . 7. STUDY PLAN See Tut Letter 102 for a proposed schedule to pace you through the eight units of INF1511. INF1511/101/0/2023 9 8 HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 8.1 What does it mean to study fully online? Studying fully online modules means that: • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office. • All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you via e-mail and SMS, and use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these platforms to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 9. ASSESSMENT 9.1 Assessment criteria Each of the 8 units of INF1511 has a theory MCQ quiz (for self-assessment), a discussion session (to review the examples and learning materials), and a practical MCQ quiz (based on the examples reviewed during the discussion session). 9.2 Assessment plan • To complete this module, you will be required to submit 8 assessments. • All information about when and where to submit your assessments will be made available to you via the myModules site for your module. • Due dates for assessments, as well as the actual assessments are available on the myModules site for this module. • The assignment weighting for the module is 30%. • You will receive examination information via the myModules sites. Please watch out for announcements on how examinations for your registered modules will be conducted. • The examination will count 70% towards the final module mark. 9.3 Assessment due dates • There are no assignment due dates included in this tutorial letter. • Assignment due dates will be made available to you on the myUnisa landing page for this module. We envisage that the due dates will be available to you upon registration. • Please start working on your assessments as soon as you register for the module. • Log on to the myUnisa site for this module to obtain more information on the due dates for the submission of the assessments. 10 9.4 Submission of assessments • Unisa, as a comprehensive open distance e-learning institution (CODeL), is moving towards becoming an online institution. You will therefore see that all your study material, assessments and engagements with your lecturer and fellow students will take place online. We use myUnisa as our virtual campus. • The myUnisa virtual campus will offer students access to the myModules site, where learning material will be available online and where assessments should be completed. This is an online system that is used to administer, document, and deliver educational material to students and support engagement between academics and students. • The myUnisa platform can be accessed via https://my.unisa.ac.za. Click on the myModules 2023 button to access the online sites for the modules that you are registered for. • The university undertakes to communicate clearly and as frequently as is necessary to ensure that you obtain the greatest benefit from the use of the myModules learning management system. Please access the announcements on your myModules site regularly, as this is where your lecturer will post important information to be shared with you. • When you access your myModules site for the module/s you are registered for, you will see a welcome message posted by your lecturer. Below the welcome message you will see the assessment shells for the assessments that you need to complete. Some assessments may be multiple choice, some tests, others written assessments, some forum discussions, and so on. All assessments must be completed on the assessment shells available on the respective module platforms. • To complete quiz assessments, please log on to the module site where you need to complete the assessment. Click on the relevant assessment shell (Assessment 1, Assessment 2, etc.). There will be a date on which the assessment will open for you. When the assessment is open, access the quiz online and complete it within the time available to you. Quiz assessment questions are not included in this tutorial letter (Tutorial Letter 101) and are only made available online. You must therefore access the quiz online and complete it online where the quiz has been created. • It is not advisable to use a cell phone to complete the quiz. Please use a desktop computer, tablet or laptop when completing the quiz. Students who use a cell phone find it difficult to navigate the Online Assessment tool on the small screen and often struggle to navigate between questions and successfully complete the quizzes. In addition, cell phones are more vulnerable to dropped internet connections than other devices. If possible, please do not use a cell phone for this assessment type. 9.5 The assessments As indicated in section 9.2, you need to complete 8 assessments for this module. There are no assignments included in this tutorial letter. Assignments and due dates will be made available to you on myModules for this module. We envisage that the due dates will be available to you upon registration. INF1511/101/0/2023 11 9.6 Other assessment methods The module uses MCQs, the theory is self-assessment, and the practical is assignment. 9.7 The examination Examination information and details on the format of the examination will be made available to you online via the myUnisa site. Look out for information that will be shared with you by your lecturer and e-tutors (where relevant) and for communication from the university. 9.7.1 Invigilation/proctoring Since 2020 Unisa conducts all its assessments online. Given stringent requirements from professional bodies and increased solicitations of Unisa’s students by third parties to unlawfully assist them with the completion of assignments and examinations, the University is obliged to assure its assessment integrity through the utilisation of various proctoring tools: Turnitin, Moodle Proctoring, the Invigilator App and IRIS. These tools will authenticate the student’s identity and flag suspicious behaviour to assure credibility of students’ responses during assessments. You may encounter any or all of these in your registered modules: Turnitin is a plagiarism software that facilitates checks for originality in students’ submissions against internal and external sources. Turnitin assists in identifying academic fraud and ghost writing. Students are expected to submit typed responses for utilisation of the Turnitin software. The Moodle Proctoring tool is a facial recognition software that authenticates students’ identity during their Quiz assessments. This tool requires access to a student’s mobile or laptop camera. Students must ensure their camera is activated in their browser settings prior to their assessments. The Invigilator “mobile application-based service does verification” of the identity of an assessment participant. The Invigilator Mobile Application detects student dishonesty-by-proxy and ensures that the assessment participant is the registered student. This invigilation tool requires students to download the app from their Play Store (Google, Huawei and Apple) on their mobile devices (camera enabled) prior to their assessment. IRIS Invigilation software verifies the identity of a student during assessment and provides for both manual and automated facial verification. It can record and review a student’s assessment session. It flags suspicious behaviour by the students for review by an academic administrator. IRIS software requires installation on laptop devices that are webcam enabled. Students who are identified and flagged for suspicious dishonest behaviour arising from the invigilation and proctoring reports are referred to the disciplinary office for formal proceeding. Students must refer to their module assessment information on their myModule sites to determine which proctoring or invigilation tool will be utilised for their formative and summative assessments. It is mandatory to have one of the formative assessments utilise the proctoring tool that will be utilised in the summative assessments to alleviate pressures associated with lack of examination unreadiness by students. The Quiz assessment utilises the Moodle Proctoring tool. 12 9.8 Supplementary Students may qualify for supplementary exams in the next year. 10. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY 10.1 Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of taking the words, ideas and thoughts of others and presenting them as your own. It is a form of theft. Plagiarism includes the following forms of academic dishonesty: • Copying and pasting from any source without acknowledging the source. • Not including references or deliberately inserting incorrect bibliographic information. • Paraphrasing without acknowledging the original source of the information. 10.2 Cheating Cheating includes, but is not limited to, the following: • Completing assessments on behalf of another student, copying the work of another student during an assessment, or allowing another student to copy your work. • Using social media (e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram) or other platforms to disseminate assessment information. • Submitting corrupt or irrelevant files, this forms part of examination guidelines • Buying completed answers from so-called “tutors” or internet sites (contract cheating). 10.3 For more information about plagiarism, follow the link below: https://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/myunisa/default/Study-@-Unisa/Student-values-and-rules 11. STUDENTS LIVING WITH DISABILITIES The Advocacy and Resource Centre for Students with Disabilities (ARCSWiD) provides an opportunity for staff to interact with first-time and returning students with disabilities. If you are a student with a disability and would like additional support or need additional time for assessments, you are invited to contact the primary lecturer of the module to discuss the assistance that you need. 12.
