To do this assignment, you need access to the JustLee books database Question 1: Chapter 5 Currently, the contents of the Category column in the BOOKS table are the actual names for each category. This structure presents a problem if one user enters COMPUTER for the Computer category and another user enters COMPUTERS. To avoid this and other problems that might occur, the database designers have decided to create a CATEGORY table containing a code and description for each category. The structure for CATEGORY table should be as follows: Column Name Datatype Width Constraints CATCODE VARCHAR2 3 PRIMARY KEY CATDESC VARCHAR2 11 NOT NULL The data for the CATEGORY table is as follows: CATCODE CATDESC BUS BUSINESS CHN CHILDREN COK COOKING COM COMPUTER FAL FAMILY LIFE FIT FITNESS SEH SELF HELP LIT LITERATURE INF3707/101/3/2018 15 1.1 Create the CATEGORY table (3 marks) 1.2 Populate the Category table it with the given data. Save the changes permanently (8 marks). 1.3 Add a column to the BOOKS table called Catcode. Add a FOREIGN KEY constraint that requires all category codes entered in the BOOKS to be the same as those in the CATEGORY table (4 marks). 1.4 Set the Catcode values for the existing rows in the BOOKS table, based on each book’s current Category value (8 marks). 1.5 Verify that the correct categories have been assigned in the BOOKS table, and save changes permanently (1 marks). 1.6 Delete the Category column from the BOOKS table (1 marks). Question 2: Chapter 8 Give SQL statements for the following requests. 2.1 Which customers live in Georgia or New Jersey? Put the results in ascending order by last name. List each customer’s customer number, last name and the state.(5 marks) 2.2 List authors whose last name contains the letter pattern “IN”. Put the results in order of last name, then first name. List each author’s last name and first name. (5 marks) Question 3 Chapter 9 To perform this activity, refer to the tables of the JustLee Books database The marketing Department of JustLee Books is preparing for its annual sales promotion. Each customer who places an order during the promotion will receive a gift with each book purchased. Each gift will be based on the book’s retail price. JustLee Books also participates in co-op advertising programs with certain publishers. If the publisher’s name is included in the advertisements, JustLee Books is reimbursed a certain amount of the advertisement cost. 3.1 To determine the projected cost of this year’s sales promotion, the marketing Department needs the publisher’s name, profit amount and the gift description for each book in the JustLee Books inventory. Give SQL statements for the above request. (3 marks) 3.2 The Marketing Department is analysing books that do not sell. List ISBN for books with no sales recorded. Use a set operator to complete this task. (2 marks). Question 4: Chapter 10 Give SQL statements for the following requests. 4.1 Determine the amount of total profit generated by the book purchased on order 1002. Display the book title and profit. The profit should be formatted to display a dollar sign and two decimal places. Take into account that the customer might not pay the full retail price and each item ordered can involve multiple copies. (5 marks) 4.2 Display a list of all book titles and percentage of mark-up for each book. The percentage of mark-up should be displayed as a whole number (that is, multiplied by 100) with no decimal position, followed by a percent sign (for example, 0.2793 = 28%). The percentage of mark-up should reflect the difference between the retail and cost amounts as a percent of the cost.). (5 marks) 16 Question 5: Chapter 11 Give SQL statements for the following requests. 5.1 Determine which books cost less than the average cost of other books in the same category. Use subqueries to answer the question. (5 marks) 5.2 Determine which books were shipped to the same state as order 1014. Use subqueries to answer the question.
