States because if we start with an empty board we can choose to place any of the 16 tokens in the position and we can choose any 15 of the remaining if we place one digit. (ii) The branching factor is the number of successors generated by a given node. (iii) put (p,I,j) with p∑ {1,2,3,4} and 1≤I,j,≤4. This allows us to put a 1 or 2 in the appropriate place given the row and Colum (iv) suppose we put a 1 in the first column of the board that is {1 ,4, 0 ,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,1,0 } you can also represent the results in matrix form (v) it is based on the rules of the game result from a row and a column or the diagonals. You can estimate a goal as all numbers computed are different.by merely estimating the game by computing value of 4 and 2 at the bottom it leads to the solving of the game see below {1,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,3,1,2} Question 2 a) An admissible heuristic function never over-estimates the cost to the goal b) Step Node Expanded Frontier 1 A(20) 2 A(20) B(17), E(19) 3 B(17) E(19),C(14) 4 C(14) E(19),D(16), F(10) 5 F(10) E(19),D(16),G(6) 6 G(6) E(19),D(16),D(14), H(5) 7 H(5) The goal is reached b) Because for every edge you need to verify the distance plus the length it holds Question 3 a)Utility Function o Provides an indication of the apparent numerical value of a state S for player P. o It is used to find the best available move for a player Whereas An evaluation function, also known as a heuristic evaluation function or static evaluation function, is a function used by game-playing programs to estimate the value or goodness of a position in the minimax and related algorithms Similarities The evaluation function is typically designed to prioritize speed over accuracy; the function looks only at the current position and does not explore possible moves (therefore static).and The Utilty function is also used to find the best available move for a player b) (i) A=3 B=3 C=2 D=3 E=5 F=7 G=8 H=2 I=9 (ii) at B because B has higher utility value than c (iii) A=(3,∞) , B= (−∞,3), C=(3,∞) , G=(3,∞) (iV) alpha cut below C, H and I are prunned Question 4 NC NW FS MP KZ LP KZ EC WC GP (b) Using the MRV Choose NC and Assign Red Domain FS,NW,KZ,MP,LP,GP ={Red,Blue,Green, Yellow} Domain NC,BC = {Blue,Green, Yellow} Choose NC and assign Blue Domain FS,NW,KZ,MP,LP,GP ={Red,Blue,Green, Yellow} Domain NC,BC = {Green, yellow} (C) NC NW FS MP KZ LP KZ EC WC GP Question 5 (a) Brother(x,y) : x is the brother of y (b) 1.Brother (Huey,Louie) 2.
