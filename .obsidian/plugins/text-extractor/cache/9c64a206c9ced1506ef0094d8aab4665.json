The values shoutd be assigned to the cells In such a way that the values for each row adds up to 6, the values for each column adds up to 6, and at least one of the diagonals should add up to 6 This problem can be presented as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (a) Define the vanables for this problem. Provide appropriate notation for your answer @) (b) Define the domains for the vanables of this puzzle. 2) (c) Provide the constraints for this problem 7) (d) If the value 2 is assigned to entry My, (.6 My = 2), make the remaining variables domain consistent (don’t solve the square!) 4)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
