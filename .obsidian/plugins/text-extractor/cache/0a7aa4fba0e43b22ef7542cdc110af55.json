Horn Formula Definition • H = (p  q) ^ (t^r  T) ^ (p^r^s  ) • In other words: – 1 or more clauses separated by AND – Each clause must have: • NO negations • One implication • The left hand side of implication: – can be one or more of ( | T | atom) separated by an AND • The right hand side of implication: – must be one of ( | T | atom) Horn Formula – other definition • A formula is a Horn formula if it is in CNF and every disjunction contains at most one positive literal. • Horn clauses are clauses, which contain at most one positive literal. • H=(p V ~q) ^ (~c V ~p V q) ^ (~t V ~r) ^ d • H =(q  p) ^ (c^p  q) ^ (t^r  ) ^ (T d) Horn Formula – cont. • Horn formula allows to efficiently compute satisfiability. • If a set of formulas is not satisfiable – There is a contradiction / inconsistency in the rules • Useful to build a knowledge base The Algorithm to test for Satisfiability Function HORN () //precondition:  is a Horn formula //postcondition: HORN () decides the satisfiability for  { mark all occurrences of T in  while there is a conjunct p1 ^ p2 ^ … pn  P of  such that all pj are marked but P is not mark P end while if  is marked return ‘unsatisfiable’ else return ‘satisfiable’ end if } Exercises • (T q) ^ (T  s) ^ (w ) ^ (p^q^sv) ^ (vs) ^ (Tr) ^(rp) • Mark: q, s, r through (Tq),(Ts),(Tr) • (T q) ^ (T  s) ^ (w ) ^ (p^q^sv) ^ (vs) ^ (Tr) ^(rp) • Mark: p through (rp) • (T q) ^ (T  s) ^ (w ) ^ (p^q^sv) ^ (vs) ^ (Tr) ^(rp) • Mark: v through (p^q^sv) • (T q) ^ (T  s) ^ (w ) ^ (p^q^sv) ^ (vs) ^ (Tr) ^(rp) • Return? – Satisfiable Exercises • (p^q^sp) ^ (q^rp) ^ (p^ss) • No occurrences of T in  • Nothing is marked • Returning: Satisfiable Exercises • (p^q^sp) ^ (q^rp) ^ (p^ss) • Remember that a formula  is satisfiable if there is an interpretation that makes the formula  true. • Let p, q, r, s be false, then – (p^q^sp) is True (false implying anything is True), – (q^rp) is True – (p^ss) is True – The formula is True Exercises • (p^q^s) ^ (q^r) ^ (s) • No occurrences of T in  • Nothing is marked • Returning: Satisfiable • When p, q, r, s are false, the formula is True","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
