We trust that you will find this module stimulating and interesting and wish you a successful year. The focus of this module is on advanced object-oriented programming aspects using C++ as the implementation language and the Qt 5 framework for developing object-oriented applications. Do not hesitate to contact your lecturer (by email or telephone; the details are on the home page of the COS3711 myUnisa site) if you are experiencing problems with the content of this tutorial letter or any aspect of the module. We sincerely hope that you find this module, as well as your online learning experience, interesting and rewarding and trust that you will complete the module successfully. Because this is a fully online module, you will need to use myUnisa to study and complete the learning activities for this module. Visit the website for COS3711 on myUnisa frequently. 1.1 Getting started Owing to the nature of this module, you can read about the module and find your study material online. Go to the website at https://my.unisa.ac.za and log in using your student number and password. Click on \"myModules\" at the top of the web page and then on the module that you want to access. All study material for this module will be available on myUnisa. It is thus very important that you register on myUnisa and access the module site on a regular basis. You must be registered on myUnisa to be able to access your learning material, submit your assignments, gain access to various learning resources, “chat” to your lecturer/e-tutor and fellow students about your studies and the challenges that you might encounter, and to participate in online discussion forums. Importantly, myUnisa contains the lessons which contains the study material for this module. Some of the study materials are provided in PDF format for downloading from myUnisa. This will allow you to read the study materials, even if you are not online. You can find a copy of the online lessons on myUnisa in PDF format (TL102). While the PDF materials may appear slightly different from the online study materials, the content is exactly the same. Note that no tutorial matter will be printed and these will only be available on myUnisa. Please activate your myLife email address as well as obtain access to the myUnisa module site. Remember that the University will use your myLife email account to contact you, and we will also use it to send you important updates to material in COS3711. It may be a good idea to set up forwarding of emails sent to your myLife account to your primary email account or some other account that you access regularly. 4 1.2 e-Tutors Once you have been registered for this module, you will be allocated to a group of students under the support of an e-tutor who will be your tutorial facilitator. We strongly encourage you to use your e-tutor – do the exercises that are posted online, attend the online workshops, email the e- tutor when you have problems, and discuss the module content on the e-tutor’s discussion forums. The point of the e-tutor is to help you, and it would be a pity if you were not to use this valuable resource. Of course, you can still contact the module lecturer if you need to. We wish you every success with your studies! 2 OVERVIEW OF COS3711 2.1 Purpose COS3711 is a final year undergraduate module. We are obliged to offer a course that is comparable in standard to what other universities in the world offer in advanced programming concepts at this level. In the School of Computing, we opted for an advanced programming course using the public domain framework Qt 5. This module teaches a selection of design patterns to improve your existing object-oriented programming knowledge, new programming aspects such as concurrency, XML handling, and regular expressions as well as the reuse of open-source libraries and tools, using the Qt 5 framework. In addition, some network programming and cloud computing concepts will be included. The topics covered in this module require a good working knowledge of C++ as well as object- oriented programming knowledge as covered in the first- and second-level programming modules. A more detailed list of what you are expected to know can be found on the home page for this module. After completing this module, you should have a deeper understanding of both the C++ language and the Qt libraries, as well as of the design patterns used in developing applications with them. 2.2 Outcomes After completing this module you should be able to:  Understand, recognise and implement a number of design patterns  Understand and reuse libraries  Understand and implement concurrent programming techniques  Use regular expressions in an application environment  Generate and parse XML files  Understand and implement reflective programming COS3711/101/0/2022 5  Write programs that connect to a network  Describe cloud computing concepts and tools 3 CURRICULUM TRANSFORMATION Unisa has implemented a transformation charter based on five pillars and eight dimensions. In response to this charter, we have placed curriculum transformation high on the teaching and learning agenda. Curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both programme and module levels as a phased-in approach. You will notice a marked change in the teaching and learning strategy implemented by Unisa, together with how the content is conceptualised in your modules. We encourage you to embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa in a responsive way within the framework of transformation. 4 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 4.1 Lecturer(s) You are welcome to contact the COS3711 lecturer.

This is also true for first-time students to Unisa. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e-learning institution. Unlike face-to-face/contact institutions, Unisa is somewhat different. It is a mega university and all our programmes are offered through a blended learning mode or fully online learning mode. It is for this reason that we thought it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support so that you can seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. In this regard we offer a specialised student support programme to students entering Unisa for the first time. We refer to this programme as Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme. The FYE is designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE programmes are currently offered:  FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE  FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated.  FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (eg videos on how to submit assignments online).  FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e-mail to fye@unisa.ac.za 7 HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 7.1 What does it mean to study fully online? Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa.  All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa.  All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office.  All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you via e-mail and SMS, and use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these platforms to ask questions and contact your lecturers. COS3711/101/0/2022 9 7.2 myUnisa tools The main tool that we will use is the Lessons tool. This tool will provide the content of and the assessments for your module. At times you will be directed to join discussions with fellow students and complete activities and assessments before you can continue with the module. It is very important that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you log in at least once a week to do the following:  Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife e-mail account so that you receive the announcement e-mails on your cellphone.  Do the Discussion Forum activities. When you do the activities for each learning unit, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you will need to go online to post your messages.  Do other online activities. For some of the learning unit activities you might need to post something on the Blog tool, take a quiz or complete a survey under the Self-Assessment tool. Do not skip these activities because they will help you complete the assignments and the activities for the module. We hope that by giving you extra ways to study the material and practise all the activities, this will help you succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module, you MUST go online regularly to complete the activities and assignments on time. 8 ASSESSMENT 8.1 Assessment plan The following is a breakdown of the formal assessment activities as they become due during the year:  There will be 3 assignments during the course of the year.  There will be 1 exam at the end of the year. The assignments are not provided in this tutorial letter; they will be provided online as they become due. You will see them when you go online. 8.2 Year mark and final examination weights Assessment Year mark Final mark Assignment 1 35% 20% Assignment 2 35% Assignment 3 30% Examination 80% 10 The three assignments together count 20% of the overall final mark, with the exam counting the remaining 80% to the final module mark. 9 ACADEMIC DISHONESTY 9.1 Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of taking the words, ideas and thoughts of others and presenting them as your own. It is a form of theft which involves several dishonest academic activities, such as the following:  Cutting and pasting from any source without acknowledging the source.  Not including or using incorrect references.  Paraphrasing without acknowledging the original source of the information. 9.2 Cheating Cheating includes, but is not limited to, the following:  Completing assessments on behalf of another student, copying from another student during an assessment or allowing a student to copy from you.  Using social media (e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram) or other platforms to disseminate assessment information.  Submitting corrupt or irrelevant files.  Buying completed answers from “tutors” or internet sites (contract cheating). 9.3 More information More information about plagiarism can be downloaded on the link below https://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/myunisa/default/Study-@-Unisa/Student-values-and-rules 10 STUDENTS WITH DISABILITY The Advocacy and Resource Centre for Students with Disability (ARCSWiD) provides an opportunity for staff to interact with new and returning students with disabilities.  If you are a student with a disability and would like additional support or need additional time for assessments, you are invited to contact your lecturer so that you can be assisted. 11 IN CLOSING Do not hesitate to contact us by e-mail if you are experiencing problems with the content of this tutorial letter or with any academic aspect of the module.
