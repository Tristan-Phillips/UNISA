Question 1 [20 marks] Assume that you have been asked to plan the lifecycle of the interactive design for a local town’s electronic library system. 1.1 List and define the four basic but essential activities of interaction design. (8) 1.2 Draw a diagram that shows the flow between the activities in a typical interaction design lifecycle model. (8) 1.3 Apply these activities to the electronic library system mentioned above. (4) Answer: See Preece, Rogers, Sharp, 4th ed., Chapter 9, p. 330-333. 1.1 a) Establishing requirements: what kind of support an interactive product should provide to the target users. (2) b) Designing alternatives: exploring different alternative activities to meet the requirements, e.g. conceptual design and concrete design options. (2) c) Prototyping: paper-based prototypes/models; or a basic piece of software; role-playing using a model. (2) d) Evaluating: determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design with a high level of user involvement. (2) 1.2 The diagram should show the iterative and intertwined nature (connecting lines: 4) of the four activities (4) – see Figure 9.3 in the textbook (p. 332). INF3720/103/02/2019 3 1.3 a) Librarians’ and library users’ needs should underpin the subsequent design, e.g., would users have to be able to view the catalogue online? (1) b) After data gathering regarding the library users’ needs, the interaction designer should compile a conceptual design that shows the various activities (such as lending a book, returning a book, browsing the catalogue, etc.) and the relations between these facilities. (1) c) The programming team could be asked to design examples of the various screens for the planned system (without any functionality). (1) d) Users can be asked to give feedback on the conceptual model or prototype before detailed coding of the functionality starts. (1) Question 2 Total: 20 marks 2.1 Develop a scenario, use case and essential use case for buying a DVD online. (10) 2.2 Discuss hierarchical task analysis (HTA) (5) and design a graphical representation of the task analysis for buying a DVD online. (5) 2.1 Answer (See Preece, Rogers, Sharp, 4th ed., Chapter 10, p. 370-380.) A scenario defines when, where and how the story of a persona (main character whom the story is about) takes place. In this case, the persona is the online shopper who wants to buy a DVD. The buyer would like to have a simple and straight-forward system allowing her to log on to an online DVD shop, select her favourite category of films (e.g. romance, comedy or action), pick one or more DVDs and finalise the order. (2) A use case focuses on the user-system interaction rather than the user’s task itself. The scenario above is rendered in more technical terms as follow: the user logs on to the online DVD shop, browses to the required category of films (e.g. romance, comedy or action), selects one or more DVDs and puts it in the shopping basket, moves to the payment facility, enters her credit card details and finalises the transaction. (2) This can be shown in a use case diagram (2), e.g.: INF3720/103/02/2019 4 Log on Shows user’s stored profile Browse to required category Show menu of film categories Actor: DVD buyer Select DVDs Show films in selected category alphabetically Show tickboxes next to selected DVDs Actor: Online DVD shopping system Put selected DVDs in shopping basket Display shopping list, prices, tax and total due Enter credit card details Send security code for safe payment Finalise payment Confirm receipt of payment and delivery details INF3720/103/02/2019 5 An essential use case represents a generalised use case that avoids assumptions about the software system. It shows the name of the user intention and stepped descriptions of user actions and system responsibilities. (2) The scenario and use case above can be represented by an essential use case as follows (2): byDVD USER INTENTION SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITY Specif y favourite category Show menu of various categories Identify required DVD Show DVDs in selected category Finalise transaction Show items in shopping basket with prices Show sales tax and total due Send payment and delivery confirmatio n 2.2 Answer: (See Preece, Rogers, Sharp, 4th ed., Chapter 10, p. 380-382.) HTA involves breaking a task down into subtasks and sub-subtasks. (1) Pros: It allows an objective comparison of alternative designs. / It provides a good understanding of the appropriate level of interaction facilitating good design. / Supports design reuse. (Any two: 2) Cons: The notation of a complex task may become unwieldy. (1) / An HTA cannot show parallel tasks and interruptions. (1) Diagram (5) – any four of the tasks and the connecting lines. See Figure 10.15 in the textbook (p. 381). INF3720/103/02/2019 6 Question 3 Total: 20 marks 3.1 Assume that you have been contracted by Unisa to do a usability testing of its online learning management system, myUnisa, within a controlled setting involving users. Give some guidelines with examples to facilitate such an evaluation process (10). 3.2 Discuss how you would inform the participants in this project (see 3.1 above) about their rights. (10) Answer: (See Preece, Rogers, Sharp, 4th ed., Chapter 13, p. 456-458) 3.1 a) Usability testing in a controlled setting reduces outside influences and distractions (1) – I will get lecturers, students and e-tutors in a University lab and give them certain predefined activities to do on myUnisa – this will allow me to observe certain behaviours (1). b) Other data collection methods can be used, such as interviews and questionnaires (1) – I will confirm my observations and analysis using structured interviews with a second group of myUnisa users (1). c) Users are required to perform typical tasks to test whether the system does what it is supposed to (1) – I will ask users to access study ma ssions and submit assignments while terial, participate in discu evaluating how efficient the system facilitates these tasks (1). d) Users’ reactions to the interactive product can reveal usability issues that could be missed in other experiments and reports (1) – I will ask a team of postgraduate researchers to observe the myUnisa users’ body language and to ask follow-up questions when they express joy or frustration (1). e) When there is more than one way to conduct a certain task, participants could be asked to perform all of these in order to evaluate which one is the best or the fastest (1) – I will ask the myUnisa users to use different ways to contact an e-tutor and to reflect on these activities. I will then ask the myUnisa users which of the these approaches they prefer and why (1). 3.2 Answer: ( See Preece, Rogers, Sharp, 4th ed., Chapter 13, p. 469-470). Participants should be protected to ensure that they are not endangered physically or emotionally. (1) Their right to privacy should also be protected. (1) For this project, I would get ethical clearance from Unisa to involve its employees and students for the study. (1) My ethical clearance application will clarify how the participants (myUnisa users) and the collected data will be treated (1), how the data will be analysed (1) and stored (1), and how anonymity will be ensured (1). The participants (myUnisa users) will be informed about what they will be asked to do (1), the conditions under which they will participate (1) and what will be done with the collected data (1). They should be told their rights (1), e.g. that they may withdraw at any time using an informed consent form (1). (Max. 10). Question 4 Total: 20 marks Compare usability testing, experiments and field studies under the following headings: 4.1 The environment in which the evaluation is conducted (6 marks) 4.2 The number and type of the participants (6 marks) 4.3 The focus, scope and approach of data collection (8 marks) Answer (Chapter 14, pp 474-495): 4.1 The environment in which the evaluation is conducted  Field studies are conducted in the natural environment where the system or product is used, for example, at a company where the product would be used. (2)  Experiments can be conducted in a laboratory or in the real-life world depending on the goal of the experiment, for example, in a student computer lab at a university library. (2)  Usability testing is conducted in a laboratory where the conditions are controlled during the experiment, for example, in a usability laboratory. (2) INF3720/103/02/2019 7 4.2 The participants  For usability testing, 5 to12 users are an acceptable number. The testing is performed by typical users for which the system was designed. (2)  Participants in experiments should be selected carefully in order to avoid any bias. There are three different designs: different-participant design, same-participant design and matched-pairs design. (2)  Field studies may include thousands of participants or even just one participant. It may include typical users or users who would not use the system. (2) Data collection Usability testing (3)  The focus is mainly on the product being tested and its usability problems.  Data collection includes user testing, interviews and user satisfaction questionnaires, which are lab-based.  Variables are controlled during data collection.  Data is captured through video recording of body gestures, thinking aloud, observations, completing questionnaire surveys and structured or semi-structured interviews. Experiments (2)  Experiments are used to test hypotheses that are based on a specific theory.  Variables can be dependent or independent.  Experiments are often reductionist (it focuses on one specific aspect).  Statistical tests are often used to analyse specific measurements. Field testing (3)  The focus is on the user, the environment and the product.  Data collection is mostly done by qualitative approaches, involving observation, focus groups and interviews.  Variables are not controlled during data collection.  Data is captured through audio and video recording, taking field notes, or filling diaries. Question 5 Total: 20 marks Assume the role of an expert evaluator and do a heuristic evaluation of a single typical student task that you have identified as a possible problem on myUnisa. List ten heuristics and apply each one to a related possible problem, using the table format below. (20) Heuristic Findings (possible problems related to myUnisa)(allocate 1 mark per finding) 1-10.
