Only ninjas can see Bob. 󰇛ࡂ   ࡂ    ㄮ  ¬ ㄮ 󰇜 Not well formed, a quantifier is not a term. Not well formed, a predicate is not a term Well-formed formulae Not well formed, quantifiers are used with variables (definition 2.3) Well formed formulae G(x) is not free for y in phi since after replacing some free occurring y with g(x), they become bound. A M = {n|n }  PM = {2n} QM = {y = } A M = {n|n }  PM = {2n} QM = {y =  } since x3 contains p and q it means that there exists a world that x1 goes to such that if it contains p the it also contains q. Since all worlds that x2 goes to contain q the formulae therefore holds. Since x3 only goes to x1 and it contains p and q the formula holds Formulae says that all worlds that x3 go to in turn go to some world that contains p, this is true since x3 goes to x1 only which in turn back to x3 which contain p The formula does not hold, it reads that either the agent believes in phi or the agent believes in not phi. This means that the agent only believes, there is no instance which he does not believe which make it not valid Agent does not believe in something false, this is not valid as in the instance of the agent not knowing that what they believe in is false. It is possible that Sarah does not expect thunderstorms and necessarily the weather is reliable. If all the agents do nit know q then agent 3 or agent 4 know p K (p^q)1K2(p^q) v K3K4","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
