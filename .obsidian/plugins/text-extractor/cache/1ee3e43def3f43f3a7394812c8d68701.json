In this chapter, we have looked at what interaction design is and its importance when developing apps, products, services, and systems. To begin, a number of good and bad designs were presented to illustrate how interaction design can make a difference. We described who and what is involved in interaction design and the need to understand accessibility and inclusiveness. We explained in detail what usability and user experience are, how they have been characterized, and how to operationalize them to assess the quality of a user experience resulting from interacting with an interactive product. The increasing emphasis on designing for the user experience and not just products that are usable was stressed. A number of core design principles were also introduced that provide guidance for helping to inform the interaction design process. Key Points • Interaction design is concerned with designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives. • Interaction design is multidisciplinary, involving many inputs from wide-ranging disciplines and fields. • The notion of the user experience (how a product behaves and is used by people in the real world) is central to interaction design. (one cannot design a user experience, only design for a user experience) 3 • Optimizing the interaction between users and interactive products requires consideration of a number of interdependent factors, including o context of use, o types of activity, o UX goals, o Accessibility (extent to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible), o cultural differences, o and user groups. • Identifying and specifying relevant usability and user experience goals can help lead to the design of good interactive products. o Usability Goal (concerned with meeting a usability criteria/goal): 1. Effective to use (effectiveness) - how good system is at doing what it is supposed to 2. Efficient to use (efficiency) - the way a system supports users in carrying out their tasks 3. Safe to use (safety) - protecting the users from dangerous conditions / undesirable situations 4. Having good utility (utility) - extent to which the system provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to do 5. Easy to learn (learnability) - how easy a system is to learn to use 6. Easy to remember how to use (memorability) - how easy a system is to remember how to use, once learned o User Experience (what the interaction with the system feels like to the users (subjectively): 4 • Design principles, such as feedback and simplicity, are useful heuristics for informing, analyzing, and evaluating aspects of an interactive product. o Design principles: 1. Visibility – functions can be seen 2. Feedback – necessary part of interaction – sending information back on what has been done and achieved – different types: audio, tactile, verbal, visual and combinations of these. 3. Constraints – ways of restricting what kinds of interaction can take place 4. Consistency – similar operations/use similar elements for achieving similar goals 5. Affordance – attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it 5 Chapter 2: The Process of Interaction Design In this chapter, we looked at user-centered design and the process of interaction design. That is, what is user-centered design, what activities are required in order to design an interactive product, and how are these activities related? A simple interaction design lifecycle model consisting of four activities was introduced, and issues surrounding the involvement and identification of users, generating alternative designs, evaluating designs, and integrating user centered concerns with other lifecycles were discussed. Key Points • Different design disciplines follow different approaches, but they have commonalities that are captured in the double diamond of design. o Discover: Designers try to gather insights about the problem. o Define: Designers develop a clear brief that frames the design challenge. o Develop: Solutions or concepts are created, prototyped, tested, and iterated. o Deliver: The resulting project is finalized, produced, and launched. • It is important to have a good understanding of the problem space before trying to build anything. 6 • The interaction design process consists of four basic activities: o discover requirements, o design alternatives that meet those requirements, o prototype the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed, o and evaluate them. • User-centered design rests on three principles: o early focus on users and tasks, 1. Users’ tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development. 2. Users’ behavior and context of use are studied, and the system is designed to support them. 3. Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for. 4. Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to the latest. 5. All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their activities, and their environment. o empirical measurement, o and iterative design. These principles are also key for interaction design. • Involving users in the design process assists with expectation management and feelings of ownership, but how and when to involve users requires careful planning. • There are many ways to understand who users are and what their goals are in using a product, including rapid iterations of working prototypes. • Looking at others’ designs and involving other people in design provides useful inspiration and encourages designers to consider alternative design solutions, which is key to effective design. 7 • Usability criteria, technical feasibility, and users’ feedback on prototypes can all be used to choose among alternatives. • Prototyping is a useful technique for facilitating user feedback on designs at all stages. • Interaction design activities are becoming better integrated with lifecycle models from other related disciplines such as software engineering. 8 Chapter 3: Conceptualizing Interaction This chapter explained the importance of conceptualizing the problem and design spaces before trying to build anything. It stressed throughout the need to be explicit about the claims and assumptions behind design decisions that are suggested. It described an approach to formulating a conceptual model and explained the evolution of interface metaphors that have been designed as part of the conceptual model. Finally, it considered other ways of conceptualizing interaction in terms of interaction types, paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks. Key Points • A fundamental aspect of interaction design is to develop a conceptual model. • A conceptual model is a high-level description of a product in terms of what users can do with it and the concepts they need to understand how to interact with it. • Conceptualizing the problem space in this way helps designers specify what it is they are doing, why, and how it will support users in the way intended. Benefits of conceptualizing the design space: o Orientation - Enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the targeted users. o Open-Mindedness - Allowing the team to explore a range of different ideas to address the problems identified. o Common Ground - Allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later. • Decisions about conceptual design should be made before commencing physical design (such as choosing menus, icons, dialog boxes). • Interface metaphors are commonly used as part of a conceptual model. o Metaphors provide a structure that is similar in some way to aspects of a familiar entity (or entities), but they also have their own behaviors and properties. More specifically, an interface metaphor is one that is instantiated in some way as part of the user interface, such as the desktop metaphor • Interaction types (for example, conversing or instructing) provide a way of thinking about how best to support the activities users will be doing when using a product or service. Types: 1. Instructing: Where users issue instructions to a system. This can be done in a number of ways, including typing in commands, selecting options from menus in a windows environment or on a multitouch screen, speaking aloud commands, gesturing, pressing buttons, or using a combination of function keys. 9 2. Conversing: Where users have a dialog with a system. Users can speak via an interface or type in questions to which the system replies via text or speech output. 3. Manipulating: Where users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them (for instance, opening, holding, closing, and placing). Users can hone their familiar knowledge of how to interact with objects. 4. Exploring: Where users move through a virtual environment or a physical space. Virtual environments include 3D worlds and augmented and virtual reality systems. They enable users to hone their familiar knowledge by physically moving around. Physical spaces that use sensor-based technologies include smart rooms and ambient environments, also enabling people to capitalize on familiarity. 5. Responding: Where the system initiates the interaction and the user chooses whether to respond. For example, proactive mobile location-based technology can alert people to points of interest. They can choose to look at the information popping up on their phone or ignore it. • Paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks provide different ways of framing and informing design and research. o A Paradigm refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices. (Paradigms are overarching approaches that comprise a set of accepted practices and framing of questions and phenomena to observe.) o A vision is a future scenario that frames research and development in interaction design—often depicted in the form of a film or a narrative. (Visions are scenarios of the future that set up challenges, inspirations, and questions for interaction design research and technology development.) o A theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon; for example, the theory of information processing that explains how the mind, or some aspect of it, is assumed to work. (Theories tend to be comprehensive, explaining human-computer interactions.) o A model is a simplification of some aspect of human-computer interaction intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. (Models are an abstraction that simplify some aspect of human-computer interaction, providing a basis for designing and evaluating systems>) o A framework is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area (for example, collaborative learning), or an analytic method (for instance, ethnographic studies). (frameworks provide a set of core concepts, questions, or principles to consider when designing for a user experience or analyzing data from a user study.) 10 Chapter 5: Social Interaction Human beings are inherently social. People will always need to collaborate, coordinate, and communicate with one another, and the diverse range of applications, web-based services, and technologies that have emerged enable them to do so in more extensive and diverse ways. In this chapter, we looked at some core aspects of sociality, namely, communication and collaboration. We examined the main social mechanisms that people use in different conversational settings when interacting face to face and at a distance. A number of collaborative and telepresence technologies designed to support and extend these mechanisms were discussed, highlighting core interaction design concerns. Key Points • Social interaction is central to our everyday lives. • Social mechanisms have evolved in face-to-face and remote contexts to facilitate conversation, coordination, and awareness. • Talk and the way it is managed are integral to coordinating social interaction. • Many kinds of technologies have been developed to enable people to communicate remotely with one another. o Telepresence - refers to one party being virtually present with another party who is o present in a physical space, such as a meeting room (technology that enables a person to perform actions in a distant or virtual location as if physically present in that location) o Social presence - refers to the feeling of being there with a real person in virtual reality. Specifically, it refers to the degree of awareness, feeling, and reaction to other people who are virtually present in an online environment. • Keeping aware of what others are doing and letting others know what you are doing are important aspects of collaboration and socializing. o Co-presence (supporting people in their activities when interacting in the same physical space) 1. Physical Coordination (When people are working closely together, they talk to each other, issuing commands and letting others know how they are progressing) 2. Awareness (Awareness involves knowing who is around, what is happening, and who is talking with whom) 3. Shareable Interfaces (number of technologies have been designed to capitalize on existing forms of coordination and awareness mechanisms. These include whiteboards, large touch screens, and multitouch tables that enable groups of 11 people to collaborate while interacting at the same time with content on the surfaces) • Social media has brought about significant changes in the way people keep in touch and manage their social lives. 12 Chapter 6: Emotional Interaction This chapter described the different ways that interactive products can be designed (both deliberately and inadvertently) to make people respond in certain ways. The extent to which users will learn, buy a product online, quit a bad habit, or chat with others depends on the believability of the interface, how comfortable they feel when using a product, and/or how much they can trust it. If the interactive product is frustrating to use, annoying, or patronizing, users will easily become angry and despondent and often they stop using it. If, on the other hand, the product is pleasurable, is enjoyable to use, and makes people feel comfortable and at ease, then they will continue to use it, make a purchase, return to the website, or continue to learn. This chapter also described various interaction mechanisms that can be used to elicit positive emotional responses in users and ways of avoiding negative ones. Further, it described how new technology has been developed to detect emotional states. Key Points • Emotional aspects of interaction design are concerned with how to facilitate certain states (for example, pleasure) or avoid certain reactions (such as frustration) in user experiences. o Emotional interaction is concerned with what makes people feel happy, sad, annoyed, anxious, frustrated, motivated, delirious, and so on, and then using this knowledge to inform the design of different aspects of the user experience. • Well-designed interfaces can elicit good feelings in people. o Don Norman and his colleagues (Ortony et al., 2005) have also developed a model of emotion and behavior. It is couched in terms of different “levels” of the brain. At the lowest level are parts of the brain that are prewired to respond automatically to events happening in the physical world. This is called the visceral level (responds rapidly, making judgments about what is good or bad, safe or dangerous, pleasurable or abhorrent. It also triggers the emotional responses to stimuli (for instance fear, joy, anger, and sadness) that are expressed through a combination of physiological and behavioral responses.) At the next level are the brain processes that control everyday behavior. This is called the behavioral level (where most human activities occur. Examples include well- learned routine operations such as talking, typing, and swimming). At the highest level are brain processes involved in contemplating. This is called the reflective level (entails conscious thought where people generalize across events or step back from their daily routines. An example is switching between thinking about the narrative structure and special effects used in a horror movie and becoming scared at the visceral level when watching the movie). 13 • Aesthetically pleasing interfaces can be a pleasure to use. • Expressive interfaces can provide reassuring feedback to users as well as be informative and fun. • Badly designed interfaces often make people frustrated, annoyed, or angry. • Emotional AI and affective computing use AI and sensor technology for detecting people’s emotions by analyzing their facial expressions and conversations. o Affective computing is concerned with how to use computers to recognize and express emotions in the same way as humans do. o Emotional AI has emerged as a research area that seeks to automate the measurement of feelings and behaviors by using AI technologies that can analyze facial expressions and voice in order to infer emotions. • Emotional technologies can be designed to persuade people to change their behaviors or attitudes. o The various techniques that have been developed have been referred to as persuasive design (Fogg, 2009). They include enticing, cajoling, or nudging someone into doing something through the use of persuasive technology. • Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human qualities to objects. o Furnishing technologies with personalities and other human-like attributes can make them more enjoyable and fun to interact with. They can also motivate people to carry out various activities, such as learning. • Robots are being used in a variety of settings, including households and assisted-living homes. 14 Chapter 8: Data Gathering This chapter has focused on three main data gathering methods that are commonly used in interaction design: interviews, questionnaires, and observation (All three techniques may be used to collect qualitative or quantitative data.). It has described in detail the planning and execution of each. In addition, five key issues of data gathering were presented, and how to record the data gathered was discussed. Key Points • All data gathering sessions should have clear goals. • Depending on the study context, an informed consent form and other permissions may be needed to run the study. • Running a pilot study helps to test out the feasibility of a planned data gathering session and associated instruments such as questions. • Triangulation involves investigating a phenomenon from different perspectives. • Data may be recorded using handwritten notes, audio or video recording, a camera, or any combination of these. • There are three styles of interviews: o Structured (the interviewer asks predetermined questions similar to those in a questionnaire and the same questions are used with each participant so that the study is standardized.), o semi-structured (Semi-structured interviews combine features of structured and unstructured interviews and use both closed and open questions. The interviewer has a basic script for guidance so that the same topics are covered with each interviewee.), o and unstructured (Open-ended or unstructured interviews are at one end of a spectrum of how much control the interviewer has over the interview process) o Focus Groups – interview people in groups o Planning and Conducting and Interview ▪ Planning an interview involves developing the set of questions or topics to be covered, collating any documentation to give to the interviewee, ▪ checking that recording equipment works, ▪ structuring the interview, and ▪ organizing a suitable time and place. (Interviews involve an interviewer asking one or more interviewees a set of questions, which may be highly structured or unstructured; interviews are usually synchronous and are often face-to-face, but they don’t have to be. Increasingly, interviews are conducted remotely using one of the many teleconferencing systems.) 15 • Questionnaires may be paper-based, via email, or online. (Questionnaires are a series of questions designed to be answered asynchronously, that is, without the presence of the investigator. These questionnaires may be paper-based or available online.) o Question and Response Format: ▪ Check Boxes and Ranges ▪ Rating Scales ▪ Likert Scales ▪ Semantic Differential Scales • Questions for an interview or questionnaire can be open or closed-ended. o Closed-ended questions require the interviewee to select from a limited range of options. o Open-ended questions accept a free-range response. • Observation may be direct or indirect. (Observation may be direct or indirect. Direct observation involves spending time with individuals observing their activities as they happen. Indirect observation involves making a record of the user’s activity as it happens, to be studied at a later date.) • In direct observation, the observer may adopt different levels of participation, ranging from insider (participant observer) to outsider (passive observer). • Choosing appropriate data gathering techniques depends on the focus of the study, participants involved, nature of the technique, and resources available. Five Key Issues of Data Gathering: 1. Goal setting a. There are many different reasons for gathering data, and before beginning, it is important to set specific goals for the study. These goals will influence the nature of data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and the analysis to be performed (Robson and McCartan, 2016). 2. Identifying participants a. Participants who fit the profile (types of people from whom data is to be gathered) called the population or study population. b. Participants to be included in data gathering need to be chosen, and this is called sampling. i. The situation where all members of the target population are accessible is called saturation sampling, but this is quite rare. ii. If only a portion of the population will be involved in data gathering, then there are two options: 16 1. probability sampling - the most commonly used approaches are simple random sampling (can be achieved by using a random number generator or by choosing every nth person in a list) or stratified sampling (relies on being able to divide the population into groups and then applying random sampling.) or 2. nonprobability sampling - the most common approaches are convenience sampling (describe a situation where the sample includes those who were available rather than those specifically selected) (Another form of convenience sampling is snowball sampling, in which a current participant finds another participant and that participant finds another, and so on) or volunteer panels (both rely less on choosing the participants and more on the participants being prepared to take part.) 3. The crucial difference between probability and nonprobability methods is that in the former you can apply statistical tests and generalize to the whole population, while in the latter such generalizations are not robust. 3. Relationship with participants a. One significant aspect of any data gathering is the relationship between the person (people) doing the gathering and the person (people) providing the data. Making sure that this relationship is clear and professional will help to clarify the nature of the study. b. This can be achieved by an informed consent form which is 4. Triangulation a. Four types of triangulation have been defined (Jupp, 2006). i. Triangulation of data means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in different places, or from different people (possibly by using a different sampling technique). ii. Investigator triangulation means that different researchers (observers, interviewers, and so on) have been involved in collecting and interpreting the data. iii. Triangulation of theories means the use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view the data or findings. iv. Methodological triangulation means to employ different data gathering techniques. 5. Pilot studies 17 a. A pilot study is a small trial run of the main study. The aim is to make sure that the proposed method is viable before embarking on the real study. 18 Chapter 11: Discovering Requirements This chapter examined the requirements activity in greater detail. The data gathering techniques introduced in Chapter 8 are used here in various combinations in the requirements activity. In addition, contextual inquiry, studying documentation, and researching similar products are commonly used techniques. Personas and scenarios help to bring data and requirements to life, and in combination they can be used to explore the user experience and product functionality. Use cases and essential use cases are helpful techniques for documenting the findings from data gathering sessions. Key Points • A requirement is a statement about an intended product that specifies what it is expected to do or how it will perform. o Discovering requirements focuses on exploring the problem space and defining what will be developed. In the case of interaction design, this includes: ▪ understanding the target users and their capabilities; ▪ how a new product might support users in their daily lives; ▪ users’ current tasks, goals, and contexts; ▪ constraints on the product’s performance; and so on. o This understanding forms the basis of the product’s requirements and underpins design and construction. • Articulating requirements and defining what needs to be built avoids miscommunication and supports technical developers and allows users to contribute more effectively. o The requirements activity sits in the first two phases of the double diamond of design. o Requirements may be discovered through targeted activities, or tangentially during product evaluation, prototyping, design, and construction. o requirements discovery is iterative, and the iterative cycles ensure that the lessons o learned from any of these activities feed into each other o Capturing requirements (prototype or operational product) explicitly is beneficial in order to make sure that key requirements aren’t lost through the iterations. o One of the goals of interaction design is to produce usable products that support the way that people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives - Discovering and communicating requirements helps to advance this goal o User-centered design with repeated iteration and evaluation along with user involvement mitigates against misunderstanding or miscommunication. 19 • There are different kinds of requirements: o Functional (capture what the product will do), o Data (capture the type, volatility, size/amount, persistence, accuracy, and value of the required data.), o environmental (context of use) (refer to the circumstances in which the interactive product will operate), ▪ physical environment, such as how much lighting, noise, movement, and dust is expected in the operational environment. ▪ social environment, such as collaboration and coordination. ▪ organizational environment, user support, obtainability, training resources and facilities etc. ▪ technical environment, what technologies will the product run on or need to be compatible with, and relevant technological limitations o user characteristics (capture the key attributes of the intended user group, such as the users’ abilities and skills, and depending on the product, also their educational background, preferences, personal circumstances, physical or mental disabilities, and so on) (user may be a novice, an expert, a casual user, or a frequent user. This affects the ways in which interaction is designed.), ▪ The collection of characteristics for a typical user is called a user profile. Any one product may have several different user profiles. o usability goals (effectiveness, efficiency, safety, utility, learnability, and memorability.), o and user experience goals (satisfying, enjoyable, motivating, rewarding, and so on). 20 o atomic requirements shell - generic requirements structure called o User stories communicate requirements between team members. Each one represents a unit of customer-visible functionality and serves as a starting point for a conversation to extend and clarify requirements. User stories may also be used to capture usability and user experience goals. ▪ A user story represents a small chunk of value that can be delivered during a sprint. ▪ As a <role>, I want <behavior> so that <benefit>. o Requirements come from several sources: from the user community, from the business community, or as a result of the technology to be applied. o Two different kinds of requirements have traditionally been identified: ▪ Functional requirements, which describe what the product will do, and ▪ Nonfunctional requirements, which describe the characteristics (sometimes called constraints) of the product. o Interaction design involves understanding both functional and nonfunctional requirements. 21 o 22 o Data gathering for requirements ▪ interviews, observation, and questionnaires, documentation, such as manuals, standards, or activity logs, are a good source of data about prescribed steps involved in an activity, any regulations governing a task, or where records of activity are already kept for audit or safety-related purposes ▪ Using Probes to Engage with Users - Probes come in many forms and are an imaginative approach to data gathering. They are designed to prompt participants into action, specifically by interacting with the probe in some way, so that the researchers can learn more about users and their contexts. Probes rely on some form of logging to gather the data—either automatically in the case of technology probes or manually in the case of diaries or design probes. (See section 11.4.1 for full detail) ▪ Contextual Inquiry - core field research process for Contextual Design (Holtzblatt and Beyer, 2017), which is a user-centered design approach that explicitly defines how to gather, interpret, and model data about how people live in order to drive design ideation (See section 11.4.2 for full detail). ▪ Brainstorming for innovation - Brainstorming is a generic technique used to generate, refine, and develop ideas. It is widely used in interaction design specifically for generating alternative designs or for suggesting new and better ideas to support users (See section 11.4.3 for full detail). • Scenarios provide a story-based narrative to explore existing behavior, potential use of new products under development, and futuristic visions of technology use. o A scenario is an “informal narrative description” (Carroll, 2000). It describes human activities or tasks in a story that allows exploration and discussion of contexts, needs, and requirements. o During the requirements activity, scenarios emphasize the context, the usability and user experience goals, and the activities in which the user is engaged. Scenarios are often generated during workshop, interview, or brainstorming sessions to help explain or discuss some aspect of the user’s goals. They capture only one perspective, perhaps a single use of the product, or one example of how a goal might be achieved. o Scenarios may be constructed as textual descriptions, can also use audio or video. 23 • Personas capture characteristics of users that are relevant to the product under development, synthesized from data gathering sessions. o persona is characterized by a unique set of goals, include a description of the user’s behavior, attitudes, activities, and environment. o Personas are used widely, and they have proved to be a powerful way to communicate user characteristics and goals to designers and developers. A good persona helps the designer understand whether a particular design decision will help or hinder their users. 24 • Scenarios and personas together can be used throughout the product lifecycle. • Use cases capture details about an existing or imagined interaction between users and the product. o Use cases focus on functional requirements and capture interaction. Because they focus on the interaction between a user and the product, they may be used in design to think about the new interaction being designed, but they may also be used to capture requirements—to think through details about what the user needs to see, to know about, or to react to. 25 Chapter 14: Introducing Evaluation The goal of this chapter was to introduce the main approaches to evaluation and the methods typically used. These will be revisited in greater depth in the next two chapters. This chapter stressed how evaluation is done throughout design by collecting information about users’ or potential users’ experiences when interacting with a prototype, a computer system, a component of a computer system, or a design artifact (such as a screen sketch) to improve its design. The pros and cons of running lab-based evaluations versus field studies were outlined in terms of participant reach, cost, effort, constraints, and the types of results that can be elicited. Choosing which approach to use will depend on the goals of the evaluation, the researcher’s or evaluator’s expectations, and the resources available to them. Crowdsourcing was presented as a creative way of involving a wide range of people with different ideas and skills. Finally, we briefly mentioned the ethical issues relating to how evaluation participants are treated and their rights to privacy. We also raised questions about data interpretation including the need to be aware of biases, reliability, data and ecological validity, and the scope of the study. Key Points • Evaluation and design are closely integrated. o It involves collecting and analyzing data about users’ or potential users’ experiences when interacting with a design artifact such as a screen sketch, prototype, app, computer system, or component of a computer system. A central goal of evaluation is to improve the artifact’s design. o Evaluation focuses on both the usability of the system (that is, how easy it is to learn and to use) and on the users’ experiences when interacting with it (for example, how satisfying, enjoyable, or motivating the interaction is). o Why: ▪ Simplicity and elegance are valued so that the product is a joy to own and use. ▪ Well-designed products sell. ▪ Problems to be fixed before the product goes on sale. o What: ▪ Ranges from low-tech prototypes to complete systems, from a particular screen function to the whole workflow, and from aesthetic design to safety features. ▪ Different types of evaluations will be needed depending on the type of product, the prototype or design concept, and the value of the evaluation to the designers, developers, and users. 26 ▪ In the end, the main criteria are whether the design does what the users need and want it to do; that is, will they use it? o Where: ▪ depends on what is being evaluated o When: ▪ The stage in the product lifecycle when evaluation takes place depends on the type of product and the development process being followed. ▪ When evaluations are conducted during design to check that a product continues to meet users’ needs, they are known as formative evaluations. Formative evaluations cover a broad range of design processes, from the development of early sketches and prototypes through to tweaking and perfecting a nearly finished design. ▪ Evaluations that are carried out to assess the success of a finished product are known as summative evaluations. If the product is being upgraded, then the evaluation may not focus on discovering new requirements but may instead evaluate the existing product to ascertain what needs improving. ▪ Rapid iterations of product development that embed evaluations into short cycles of design, build, and test (evaluate) are common. In these cases, the evaluation effort may be almost continuous across the product’s development and deployment lifetime. • Some of the same data gathering methods are used in evaluation as for discovering requirements and identifying users’ needs, for instance, observation, interviews, and questionnaires. • Evaluations can be done in controlled settings such as labs, less-controlled field settings, or where users are not present. o Controlled settings directly involving users (examples are usability labs and research labs): Users’ activities are controlled to test hypotheses and measure or observe certain behaviors. The main methods are usability testing and experiments. o Natural settings involving users (examples are online communities and products that are used in public places): There is little or no control of users’ activities to determine how the product would be used in the real world. The main method used is field studies (for example in-the-wild studies). o Any settings not directly involving users: Consultants and researchers’ critique, predict, and model aspects of the interface to identify the most obvious usability problems. The range of methods includes inspections, heuristics, walk-throughs, models, and analytics. 27 • Usability testing and experiments involve a high level of control over both what users do and what is tested, whereas field and in-the-wild evaluations typically impose little or no control on participants. o Usability Testing: ▪ The primary goal is to determine whether an interface is usable by the intended user population to carry out the tasks for which it was designed. ▪ The qualitative and quantitative data that is collected using these different techniques are used in conjunction with each other to form conclusions about how well a product meets the needs of its users. ▪ The findings from usability testing are often summarized in a usability specification that enables developers to test future prototypes or versions of the product against it. o Natural Settings Involving Users/ Field studies ▪ In moving into the wild, researchers inevitably have to give up control of what is being evaluated in order to observe how people approach and use—or don’t use—technologies in their everyday lives. o Any Settings Not Involving the Users ▪ Evaluations that take place without involving users are conducted in settings where the researcher has to imagine or model how an interface is likely to be used. Inspection methods are commonly employed to predict user behavior and to identify usability problems based on knowledge of usability, users’ behavior, the contexts in which the system will be used, and the kinds of activities that users undertake. ▪ Cognitive walk-throughs involve simulating a user’s problem-solving process at each step in the human-computer dialogue and checking to see how users progress from step to step in these interactions. [focus on evaluating designs for ease of learning] ▪ Analytics is a technique for logging and analyzing data either at a customer’s site or remotely. ▪ Web analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of Internet data to understand and optimize web usage. • Different methods are usually combined to provide different perspectives within a study. • Participants need to be made aware of their rights. This is often done through informed consent forms. 28 • It is important not to over-generalize findings from an evaluation. o Reliability - or consistency of a method is how well it produces the same results on separate occasions under the same circumstances. o Validity - concerned with whether the evaluation method measures what it is intended to measure. This encompasses both the method itself and the way it is implemented. o Enological Validity - particular kind of validity that concerns how the environment in which an evaluation is conducted influences or even distorts the results. o Bias - occurs when the results are distorted. o Scope - refers to how much its findings can be generalized. Language of Evaluation: ▪ Analytics Data analytics refers to examining large volumes of raw data with the purpose of drawing inferences about a situation or a design. Web analytics is commonly used to measure website traffic through analyzing users’ click data. ▪ Analytical evaluation This type of evaluation models and predicts user behavior. This term has been used to refer to heuristic evaluation, walk-throughs, modeling, and analytics. ▪ Bias The results of an evaluation are distorted. This can happen for several reasons. For example, selecting a population of users who have already had experience with the new system and describing their performance as if they were new users. ▪ Controlled experiment This is a study that is conducted to test hypotheses about some aspect of an interface or other dimension. Aspects that are controlled typically include the task that participants are asked to perform, the amount of time available to complete the tasks, and the environment in which the evaluation study occurs. ▪ Crowdsourcing This can be done in person (as was typical in citizen science for decades) or online via the web and mobile apps. Crowdsourcing provides the opportunity for hundreds, thousands, or even millions of people to evaluate a product or take part in an experiment. The crowd may be asked to perform a particular evaluation task using a new product or to rate or comment on the product. ▪ Ecological validity This is a particular kind of validity that concerns how the environment in which an evaluation is conducted influences or even distorts the results. ▪ Expert review or crit This is an evaluation method in which someone (or several people) with usability expertise and knowledge of the user population reviews a product looking for potential problems. ▪ Field study This type of evaluation study is done in a natural environment such as in a person’s home or in a work or leisure place. 29 ▪ Formative evaluation This type of evaluation is done during design to check that the product fulfills requirements and continues to meet users’ needs. ▪ Heuristic evaluation This is an evaluation method in which knowledge of typical users is applied, often guided by heuristics, to identify usability problems. ▪ Informed consent form This form describes what a participant in an evaluation study will be asked to do, what will happen to the data collected about them, and their rights while involved in the study. ▪ In-the-wild study This is a type of field study in which users are observed using products or prototypes within their everyday context. ▪ Living lab This place is configured to measure and record people’s everyday activities in a natural setting, such as in the home. ▪ Predictive evaluation This type of evaluation is where theoretically based models are used to predict user performance. ▪ Reliability The reliability or consistency of a method is how well it produces the same results on separate occasions under the same circumstances. ▪ Scope This refers to how much the findings from an evaluation can be generalized. ▪ Summative evaluation This evaluation is done when the design is complete. ▪ Usability lab This lab is specially designed for usability testing. ▪ Usability testing This involves measuring how well a design supports users’ performance on various tasks. ▪ User studies This generic term covers a range of evaluations involving users, including field studies and experiments. ▪ Users or participants In this context, these terms are used interchangeably to refer to the people who take part in evaluation studies. ▪ Validity Validity is concerned with whether the evaluation method measures what it is intended to measure. 30 Chapter 15: Evaluation Studies: From Controlled to Natural Settings This chapter described evaluation studies in different settings. It focused on controlled laboratory studies, experiments, and field studies in natural settings. A study of the iPad when it first came out and a second study conducted a year later was presented as an example of usability testing. Experimental design was then discussed that involves testing a hypothesis in a controlled research lab. The chapter ended with a discussion of field studies in which participants used prototypes and new technologies in natural settings. The Painpad example involved evaluating how patients in two hospitals, who were recovering from surgery, used a mobile device designed to enable them to self- monitor their pain levels throughout the day. Key differences between usability testing, experiments, and field studies include the location of the study—usability lab or makeshift usability lab (and living lab or online as discussed in Chapter 14), research lab, or natural environment—and how much control is imposed. At one end of the spectrum are experiments and laboratory testing, and at the other are in-the-wild field studies. Most studies use a combination of different methods, and designers often have to adapt their methods to cope with unusual new circumstances created when evaluating the new systems being developed. Key points • Usability testing usually takes place in usability labs or temporary makeshift labs. These labs enable designers and researchers to control the test setting. Versions of usability testing are also conducted remotely, online, and in living labs. o The goal is to test whether the product being developed is usable by the intended user in order to achieve the tasks for which it was designed and whether users are satisfied with their experience. • Usability testing focuses on performance measures, such as how long and how many errors are made, when completing a set of predefined tasks. Direct and indirect observation (video and keystroke logging) is conducted and supplemented by user satisfaction questionnaires and interviews. • Mobile and remote testing systems have been developed that are more portable and affordable than usability labs. Many contain mobile eye-tracking and face recognition systems and other devices. Many companies continue to use usability labs because they provide a venue for the whole team to come together to observe and discuss how users are responding to the systems being developed. 31 • Experiments seek to test a hypothesis by manipulating certain variables while keeping others constant. o Hypothesis involves examining a relationship between two things, called variables. o Variables can be independent or dependent. An independent variable is what the researcher manipulates (that is, selects). The other variable is called the dependent variable. o When setting up a hypothesis to test the effect of the independent variable(s) on the dependent variable, it is normal to derive a null hypothesis and an alternative one. o To test a hypothesis, the researcher has to set up the conditions and find ways to keep o other variables constant to prevent them from influencing the findings. This is called the experimental design. • The researcher controls independent variable(s) to measure dependent variable(s). o Experimental Designs ▪ Different-participant design 1. A single group of participants is allocated randomly to each of the experimental conditions so that different participants perform in different conditions. Another term used for this experimental design is between-subjects design. 2. Advantage is that there are no ordering or training effects caused by the influence of participants’ experience on one set of tasks to their performance on the next set, as each participant only ever performs under one condition. 3. Disadvantage is that large numbers of participants are needed so that the effect of any individual differences among participants, such as differences in experience and expertise, is minimized ▪ Same-participant design 1. Within-subjects design - all participants perform in all conditions so that only half the number of participants is needed; the main reason for this design is to lessen the impact of individual differences and to see how performance varies across conditions for each participant. It is important to ensure that the order in which participants perform tasks for this setup does not bias the results. 2. Half the participants should do task A followed by task B, and the other half should do task B followed by task A. This is known as counterbalancing. 3. Counterbalancing neutralizes possible unfair effects of learning from the first task, known as the order effect. 32 ▪ Matched-pairs design 1. Pair-wise design - participants are matched in pairs based on certain user characteristics such as expertise and gender. Each pair is then randomly allocated to each experimental condition. A problem with this arrangement is that other important variables that have not been considered may influence the results. • Field studies are carried out in natural settings. They seek to discover how people interact with technology in the real world. • Field studies that involve the deployment of prototypes or technologies in natural settings may also be referred to as in-the-wild studies. • Sometimes the findings of a field study are unexpected, especially for in-the-wild studies in which the goal is typically to explore how novel technologies are used by participants in their own homes, places of work, or outside. 33 Chapter 16: Evaluation: Inspections, Analytics, And Models This chapter presented inspection evaluation methods, focusing on heuristic evaluation and walk- throughs, which are usually done by specialists (often referred to as experts), who role-play users’ interactions with designs, prototypes, and specifications. They use their knowledge of the kinds of problems that users typically encounter, and then they offer their opinions. Heuristic evaluation and walk-throughs offer a structure to guide the evaluation process. Analytics, in which users’ interactions are logged, are often performed remotely and without users being aware that their interactions are being tracked. Large volumes of data are collected, anonymized, and statistically analyzed using specially developed software services, such as Google Analytics. The analysis provides information about how a product is used, for instance, how different versions of a website or prototype perform, or which parts of a website are seldom used—possibly because of poor usability design or lack of appeal. Data are often presented visually so that it is easier to see trends and interpret the results. A/B testing is another form of remote testing. Fundamentally, A/B testing is a controlled experiment in which two or more dependent variables are investigated using large numbers of participants who are randomly allocated to the different experimental conditions. Small differences in the UX design of a home page can, for example, be tested using A/B testing. For sites with very large populations of users, such as popular social media sites, even small differences in design can strongly impact the number of users who use the application. Fitts’ law is an example of an evaluation method that can be used to predict user performance by determining whether a proposed interface design or keypad layout will be optimal. Typically, Fitts’ law is used to compare different design layouts for virtual or physical objects, such as buttons on a device or screen. Designers and researchers often find that they have to modify these methods, as they do for those described in the previous chapter, for use with the wide range of products that have come onto the market since they were originally developed. Key Points • Inspections can be used for evaluating a range of representations including o requirements, o mockups, o prototypes, o or products. 34 • User testing and heuristic evaluation often reveal different usability problems. o Heuristic Evaluation ▪ Researchers, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialog boxes, menus, navigation structure, online help, and so on, conform to tried-and-tested principles. ▪ Revised version of Nielsen’s heuristics: 1. Visibility of System Status The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback and within reasonable time. 2. Match Between System and the Real World The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. It should follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 3. User Control and Freedom Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog. The system should support undo and redo. 4. Consistency and Standards Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. The system should follow platform conventions. 5. Error Prevention Rather than just good error messages, the system should incorporate careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall Minimize the user’s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialog to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 35 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design Dialogs should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialog competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors Error messages should be expressed in plain language (not codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. 10. Help and Documentation Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user’s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. ▪ Heuristic Evaluation for Websites: The difference between Budd’s heuristics and Nielsen’s original heuristics is that they place more emphasis on information content. 1. Clarity Make the system as clear, concise, and meaningful as possible for the intended audience. Write clear, concise copy. Only use technical language for a technical audience. Write clear and meaningful labels. Use meaningful icons. 2. Minimize Unnecessary Complexity and Cognitive Load Make the system as simple as possible for users to accomplish their tasks. Remove unnecessary functionality, process steps, and visual clutter. Use progressive disclosure to hide advanced features. Break down complicated processes into multiple steps. Prioritize using size, shape, color, alignment, and proximity. 36 3. Provide Users with Context Interfaces should provide users with a sense of context in time and space. Provide a clear site name and purpose. Highlight the current section in the navigation. Provide a breadcrumb trail (that is, show where the user has been in a website). Use appropriate feedback messages. Show the number of steps in a process. Reduce perception of latency by providing visual cues (for instance, a progress indicator) or by allowing users to complete other tasks while waiting. 4. Promote a Pleasurable and Positive User Experience The user should be treated with respect, and the design should be aesthetically pleasing and promote a pleasurable and rewarding experience. Create a pleasurable and attractive design. Provide easily attainable goals. Provide rewards for usage and progression. ▪ Doing Heuristic Evaluations: Heuristic evaluation can be broken down into three main stages: 1. briefing session, in which the user researchers are briefed about the goal of the evaluation. If there is more than one researcher, a prepared script may be used to ensure that each person receives the same briefing. 2. evaluation period, in which the user researchers typically spend 1–2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. 3. debriefing session, in which the researchers come together to discuss their findings with designers and to prioritize the problems they found and give suggestions for solutions. ▪ “Eight Golden Rules” of Ben Shneiderman: 1. Strive for consistency. 2. Seek universal usability. 3. Offer informative feedback. 4. Design dialogs to yield closure. 5. Prevent errors. 37 6. Permit easy reversal of actions. 7. Keep users in control. 8. Reduce short-term memory load • Other types of inspections used in UX design include pluralistic and cognitive walk-throughs. o Cognitive Walk-Throughs - involve simulating how users go about problem-solving at each step in a human-computer interaction. A cognitive walk-through, as the name implies, takes a cognitive perspective in which the focus is on evaluating designs for ease of learning—a focus that is motivated by observations that users learn by exploration. o Important to document the process, keeping account of what works and what doesn’t. o Pluralistic Walk-Throughs - well-established walk-through in which users, developers, and usability researchers work together to step through a task scenario. As they do this, they discuss usability issues associated with dialog elements involved in the scenario steps. o Benefits of pluralistic walk-throughs include a strong focus on users’ tasks at a detailed level, that is, looking at the steps taken. This level of analysis can be invaluable for certain kinds of systems, such as safety-critical ones, where a usability problem identified for a single step could be critical to its safety or efficiency. • Walk-throughs are a fine-grained, focused methods that are suitable for evaluating small parts of a product. • Analytics involve collecting data about user interactions to identify how users use a website or product and which parts are underused. • When applied to websites, analytics are often referred to as web analytics. Similarly, when applied to learning systems, they are referred to as learning analytics. o Web analytics is a form of interaction logging that was specifically created to analyze users’ activity on websites so that designers could modify their designs to attract and retain customers. o A/B Testing  Another way to evaluate a website, part of a website, an application, or an app running on a mobile device is by carrying out a large-scale experiment to evaluate how two groups of users perform using two different designs—one of which acts as the control and the other as the experimental condition, that is, the new design being tested. • Fitts’ law is a predictive model that has been used in HCI to evaluate keypress sequences for handheld devices. o In a nutshell, the bigger the target, the easier and quicker it is to reach it. 38 2022 Assignment 1 Study Chapters 1 to 6 of the prescribed and answer the MCQ questions 1.

Usability goals are effective, efficiency, safety, utility, learnability, and memorability 1.2 User experience (2 marks) - How a product behaves and is used by people in real world. It is about how people feel about a product and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, opening and closing it. 1.3 Metaphors (2 marks) - Metaphor = “A thing considered representative of another thing” - Are intended to provide familiar entities that enable people to readily understand the underlying conceptual model and know what to do at an interface, e.g, the desktop metaphor, the search engine. 1.4 Anthropomorphism (2 marks) - attributing human qualities to objects, e.g. virtual characters and robot pets. 1.5 Paradigm (2 marks) - refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices, e.g, ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing. 45 Question 2 School of Computing have a small library, which is not associated with university’s main library. The library has a collection of information systems and computer science textbooks and journals. The library uses excel spreadsheet to manage the library and the challenge is that when borrowers get books from the library, they return them late or sometimes never return them. The borrowers include students and all school of computing staff. You have been approached by the School of Computing to design a product that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non- returned books are tracked. 2.1 An Interaction designer is required to be part of a team that develops the Library information systems application. From what you learnt in this module, provide the job description of an Interaction designer in point form. (1 marks) Answer Job description (allocate 1 mark for the job description.

Evaluate the current version of Telegram from the perspective of social interaction of distance learning students and discuss people’s social disposition, the ideal of face-to-face conversations and the challenges in this regard, especially during the Covid-19 lockdown. Also discuss remote conversations and co-presence of distance learning students. (10 marks) Answer (Allocate 2 marks for the application per point) THEORY [p. 135-157] APPLICATION 4.1 People’s social disposition Telegram can be used to facilitate social engagement between tutors and students through text messages, one-to-one voice and video calls, and group meetings 4.2 In person, face-to-face conversations In-person conversations are not possible. It seems that Telegram currently does not allow face-to-face video group meetings (need to be verified). 4.3 Challenges for distance education during the Covid-19 lockdown If the Telegram app cannot facilitate online group meetings with video, and share live Powerpoint presentations on-screen, and the participants to see each other and collaborate in a more natural environment. So, it does not help students much on this respect. Need to consider all this in its design. 4.4 Remote conversations Tutors should schedule online weekly seminars with their students. Remote conversation technology that allows sound and video is needed to share slides and other visual course material. Being able to see each other will also build the class’s team spirit. 4.5 Co-presence Telegraph should consider the possibility to combine remote conversations with co-presence technology to simulate group work in laboratories. 49 Question 5: Chapter 6 Do an emotional interaction evaluation of the current version of Telegram App. Download the App from the Play Store or any other store available on your device. 5.1 How was the interface of the current version of Telegram designed to make customers respond in certain ways? (2 marks) 5.2 Do you think the current interface is believable and trustworthy, and why? (2 marks) 5.3 Are there any annoying interface elements that could cause users to stop using the app? Motivate your answer. (2 marks) 5.4 Is the current version of Telegram aesthetically pleasing for South African users? Motivate your answer. (2 marks) 5.5 Which technology(-ies) can be used by the app’s owning company to detect users’ emotional states? Explain your answer. (2 marks) Answer (allocate 2 marks for application per point) THEORY APPLICATION 5.1 Persuasive technologies [p. 182-186] The current version of Telegram entices users to receive and reply to messages. It is persuasive. 5.2 Secure, trustworthy, and ethical interfaces [. p. 7, 91]. [p. 26]. Telegram interface is believable and trustworthy. It is not deceptive. 5.3 Frustrating, annoying, or patronising interfaces [p. 176-177]. [p. 174-179] (3) If a user has many contacts, there is no easy way to scroll to a contact name towards the middle or end of the alphabet, and this can be frustrating. 5.4 Animated icons, sound effects and vibrotactile feedback can be aesthetically pleasing for users [p. 173]. The interface is neutral and acceptable, and South African art could be used to improve look and feel. 5.5 Cameras, biosensors, sound evaluation, body movement detectors, eye trackers, etc. [p. 179-182] Telegram can use the cell phone’s built-in camera and audio recording function to measure users’ reactions to its interface. 50 Question 6: Chapter 6 10 marks 6.1 From the perspectives of Anthony Ortony model of emotional design, how do you design interactive products that invoke the visceral, behavioural, and reflective senses. (3 marks) Answer • Visceral – Instinctive, first impressions driven by initial sensory inputs such as appearance, feel, and sound. Invocation of opportunity and exploration • Behavioural –Equates to traditional values of usability. Human actions are performed at behavioural level. How you feel when using a particular product. • Reflective – The meaning of personal value of a product in a culture. Reflective emotions are long lasting and influenced by culture, knowledge, and experience. 6.2 Visit the websites for UNISA, Wits and UCT and comment on how the design of their websites’ main page (first page) satisfies each of the components of Anthony Ortony’s model. Which websites persuade you to enrol at the university, support your answer? (3 marks) Answer (Allocate 1 mark per university) I provide a sample answer for UNISA. Students are expected to provide a similar analysis on the other universities. Visceral Behavioural Reflective • UNISA • Dynamic banner that shows informative current affairs of the university. • Vibrant colours and images of happy people. • Pleasing website, makes me like to enrol at the university at first site. • Great user experience. • Website easy to navigate. • Links and buttons are well labelled. • An easy-to-use website. • The website gives a sense of belonging. • Graduating students gives me a sense of achievement. • The picture of former president, T. Mbeki is inspiring and invokes my sense of leadership. Wits xxx xxx xxx UCT xxx xxxx xxx 6.3 Based on the weaknesses that you identified from the above websites, design the front page of UNISA website with features that invokes the visceral emotions of students who seek to enroll at the university in 2023. You can use any application to design a non-interactive main page (MS Word, Power point …or any other web editor). Focus on the design of the page not the functionality. Copy and paste the screenshot of the designed main page. Briefly describe how you incorporated the visceral component of Anthony Ortony model in the design of the website. (4 marks) Answer (allocate 2 marks for the design and 2 marks for the explanation) Students will present their designs and explain how they incorporated the Anthony Ortony’s model. I just copied and pasted UNISA website here. 51 Question 7: Chapter 8 In question 6, you recreated the main page of the UNISA website to improve user experience.

(2 marks) Answer (allocate 1 mark each for any two) Students, lecturers, administrative personnel 7.2 Explain the type of sampling that you would use to select the respondence in your study? (1 mark) Answer (allocate 1 mark) Stratified sampling because data should be collected from different groups of stakeholders to have a balanced view of each group’s needs. 52 7.3 Explain how each of the following data gathering techniques can be used to collect data when testing the website front page that you recreated. (3 marks) Answer (allocate 1 mark per technique) Technique Explanation • Interview • Structured interview protocol • Small number of participants • Audio record the interviews, transcribe, clean data, analyse, and write a report Questionnaire • Open ended or closed ended questionnaire • To collect data from many users • Collect data, clean it, analyse, and write a report Observation • Observation protocol • Collect data from a small sample • Recruit the participants • Set the test environment, set up recording equipment, carry an activity with each participant, record, moderate and observe the participant. • Analyse the recording and write a report. 7.4 Explain why consent forms are valuable when collecting data. (2 marks) • Potential participants should accept and volunteer to participate in a study • Potential participants should not be coerced or forced to participate • Potential participants should be given time to ask questions • It is ethical 7.5 List any 2 interview questions that you are going to use to collect data from students. (2 marks) Answer • A variety of questions from students. Depends on their creativity and understanding. • For example: ▪ How would you apply for an undergraduate degree from the UNISA main page? ▪ From the UNISA main page, how do you go to the College of Science and Technology? 53 Question 8: Chapter 11 School of Computing have a small library, which is not associated with university’s main library. The library has a collection of information systems and computer science textbooks and journals. The library uses excel spreadsheet to manage the library and the challenge is that when borrowers get books from the library, they return them late or sometimes never return them. The borrowers include students and all school of computing staff. You have been approached by the School of Computing to write a software program that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non-returned books are tracked. 8.1 Identify any two common types of requirements discovery in the context of the library system (2 marks). [p. 398-414] Answer (Allocate 1 mark per point for any two) • Using probes to engage with users • Contextual inquiry • Brainstorming for innovation • Personas • Scenarios • Probes • Contextual inquiry 8.2 Identify any 2 functional requirements of the library system (2 marks). Answer (Allocate 1 mark per point for any two) • A borrower can request to loan a book • Find if the borrower has books that are overdue • If the borrower has books that are overdue, refuse loan • If the borrower does not have any books, loan the book • Set the due date 8.3 Choose one functional requirement of the library systems and present it as an atomic requirement. Use the Volere template (Page 389, prescribed book). (5 marks) 54 8.4 What are user stories? (2 marks) Answer (Allocate 1 mark per point for any two) • Communicate requirements between team members • Each represents a unit of customer visible functionality • Capture usability and user experience goals • User story represents a small chunk that can be delivered during a sprint. 8.5 Based on the functional requirement that you choose, express it as a user story. (2 marks) Answer (allocate 2 marks) Here are two examples, students would provide a variety of answers • As a <librarian> I want <to know which book loans are overdue> so that <I will refuse to loan other books to the offender> • As a < MSc Student> I want <to have access to electronic books > so that <I do not travel to campus library to borrow or return books> 8.6 Based on the information about potential users, choose a user profile and produce a persona and a scenario capturing how the user is expected to interact with the library system. (7 marks) Answer (see mark allocation in the table) Persona Scenario (2 marks) Name: Peter (1 mark) Age: 25 Degree: MSc Information Systems Campus: Florida Goal (1 marks) • To access online journals • To download journal papers • To access electronic research methodology books Frustrations (1 marks) • Forgets to take back books to library • Travelling to campus to borrow books, 100 kms. • No money to travel to the campus to return books. BIO (2 marks) Peter is a 25-year-old MSc student in the Department of Information Systems. Peter is a full-time student residing in a rural area about 100 kms from Johannesburg. His research focusses on Africanisation of Information Systems subjects and wants to access research material to support his research. Peter wants to access and download journal papers from the online library. Additionally, he wants to access electronic research methodology textbooks. If the university does not have electronic copies of books, it should deliver and pick up the books from his rural home. Peter is busy with his literature analysis for his MSc research, which is to have at least twenty references. He visits the online library and searches for journal papers. The search returns several papers, he selects and downloads some papers. He failed to download 3 papers that required subscription. Peter got frustrated and he wrote an email to the librarian to download and email the papers to him. Peter also found that that the library has two books on research methodology that are only in hardcopy. He wrote to the librarian to post the books to his rural address. 55 2022 Assignment 3 All Prescribed Chapters Question 1 This question takes you through the complete software development lifecycle for an interactive product. You are required to design and evaluate an interactive product for booking tickets online for a cinema. A user is supposed to be able to book a venue for watching a movie. Most cinema venues have an online booking facility already, but it can be awkward and frustrating to identify and book the seats you want. For you to successfully answer this question, you need you talk with some people to understand their requirements, maybe a family member (20 marks). 1.1 Identify users’ needs (requirements) for the online facility. To identify user needs, you should collect data from the users. Record your data in point form (5 marks). Answer The form of data gathering students use, will depend on circumstances that they encounter. There are plenty of people to talk to about how they obtain tickets for an event and gather their requirements needs. Hence, students are expected to provide a variety of answers to this question. For example: • View movies that are showing from the cinema website • Choose the movie • Choose a venue for watching • Choose time that you want to watch • Choose seat, where you want to seat • Order headphones or earphones • Order 3D glasses • Pay • Receive SMS/email confirmation 56 1.2 Based on the user requirements, choose a user profile, and produce one persona and one scenario, capturing how the user is expected to interact with the product. (Students are expected to provide a user profile and produce one persona, then describe a scenario in detail, capturing how the user is expected to interact with a system, for example, a ticket booking system) (5 marks). Persona (2 marks) Scenario (2 marks) Name: Peter (1 mark) Age: 17 Partially deaf Goal • To watch a movie • To book a movie online • To have hearing aids in the movie house Frustrations • Some movie houses do not have hearing aids • Some websites are difficult to follow to make a booking • payment systems fails to go through BIO Peter is a 17-year-old man who is partially deaf and stays in Centurion, Pretoria. He completed his matric recently and has few friends due to his condition. Peter spends most of his time at his family house and he is lonely. For leisure, he wants to watch movies at a local cinema. Even though he will not be talking other people cinema, he enjoys being amongst other people. Peter enjoys taking part in virtual chat environments. Late one night, he is in conversation with someone who recommends that he go and see the latest James Bond movie that has just come out. It's too late to email the local cinema to see if it's on there, so he decides to use the internet to obtain some tickets for the following weekend. At the cinema website he looks for the film titles currently showing. The James Bond movie is indeed showing. From this page, chooses the 7pm performance, but it is fully-booked and offers him alternatives: the 5.30pm and the 8pm. Dan chose the 8pm booking, confirmed the booking seat, and pays for it. As he is partially deaf, he needs to double-check that the cinema is equipped with suitable sound amplification technology that links in to his hearing aid. 1.3 Perform a task analysis on the main tasks associated with the ticket booking system, i.e booking a ticket (5 marks). The tasks Peter was involved with were: • Finding if the film was on at the cinema • Finding out the times of showing • Choosing the showing • Choosing the seat • Confirming the booking • Paying for the booking • Checking for other facilities at the cinema Note that this is not a complete HTA, but is a starting point. 57 1.4 Using the data gathered in 1.1 and your subsequent analysis, identify different kinds of requirements for the product under the following headings: environmental, user and usability (5 marks). Answer Some basic considerations and example requirements from this scenario are given below. Your scenarios may be very different, and will hence yield very different requirements: Environmental (the answer should take into consideration physical, social, organisational, technical environments) (2 Marks) The user might be in a variety of physical settings, and at different times of day, e.g. at home, in the street, in the rain, etc. In our scenario Dan was probably sitting at a desktop computer but he could have been using a cell phone. User (2 marks) There are potentially many different kinds of users. You must decide who your website is targeted for: children under 18? only adults with a credit card? What about visually impaired users, or the elderly who may have difficulties controlling their movement? Usability (1 marks) The website should be usable the first time, without any training. This is an expression of the Volere requirement for the functional requirement. Question 2 Go to myUnisa under Additional resources and download the file “Case study – Academic library. pdf”. Read the case study and answer the following questions. (20 marks) 2.1 What was the purpose of the usability evaluation? (2 marks) • To determine whether or not the library’ users could effectively use the web site to perform specific tasks. • To determine how effective the library website worked when used for library research by undergraduates with little or no experience using the website 2.2 Which challenges were encountered in carrying the usability testing of the website? (4 marks) • A range of heterogeneous library participants (users) to choose from • Setting the questions fr usability testing • privacy of the testing room, to allow participants to comfortably talk aloud • Some of the participants were not punctual on appointment time and some did not pitch up • Participants had varying learning abilities and technical proficiency • Difficulties in interpreting the results due to subjective nature of variables such as aesthetics and idiosyncrasies • Presenting tasks to users in a way that the testers would learn the participants’ responses and actions • Designing unambiguous and specific questions that evaluate the usability of the site’s functionalities rather than the technical skills of the participants. 58 • Multiple links of the website confused participants when navigating from one page to the other. 2.3 List any five specific activities/tasks performed by the participants during the usability testing of the website. (5 marks) • Do the University Libraries own the book Alias Grace? • Is the journal Northeast Anthropology available in the UB Libraries? • Can you find a journal article on gospel music? • How would you find a journal article on soap operas? • I am interested in investing in what are referred to as “callable securities.” Where can I find recent articles about them? (You need to see the full article.) • Use the database SocioFile to look for an article about nursing homes and mental illness. What would you have to do to obtain this article? • How would you go about finding the author of this quotation: “And we meet, with champagne and a chicken, at last?” • Assume you are taking a class in a subject you know very little about, for example, psychology, literature, environmental science, architecture or film. If you were assigned a research paper, how would you find information resources on that subject? • Find an encyclopedia article about French wine. • Obtain background information about the “ethnic cleansing” that has taken place in Kosovo. • Does the Libraries’ Web site have a guide to doing research in computer science? 2.4 Which data collection methods were used to collect data? (4 marks) • Think aloud • Direct observation of users being tested • A written log of events that took place during testing • A record of user movements during navigation • Post evaluation user satisfaction questionnaire • Post evaluation report by the tester 2.5 List any five issues discovered by the usability testing. (5 marks) • The “Web Search” and “Need Help” links failed the “easy to learn” measure • Participants confused by the meaning of, “Online Resources” and “Library Catalogues” , which resulted in failing to satisfy the “causes few errors” measure • The process of connecting to the catalog through the “Web-interface link” was unnecessarily unpleasant. • “Online Resources” page was difficult to decipher • Users did not find the “Online Resources” page easy to use when searching an article from a named database. Participants could not identify the database titles. • On finding articles on general topics, the ‘Online Resources” page failed the entire usability test because the participants could not identify the “Quick Start” link. 59 • The participants could not identify “reference Resources” as a logical link to begin exploration of a topic. Question 3 Assume the role of an expert evaluator and do a heuristic evaluation of a single typical student task that you have identified as a possible problem on myUnisa. Use all ten heuristics and complete the table below. (20 marks) Name of the task:_________________ (Provide the name task. You cannot evaluate myUnisa because it is too big. you only have time to evaluate a single task) Heuristic Findings 1. Visibility of the system status 2. Match between system and the real world 3. User control and real world 4. Consistency and standards 5. Error prevention 6. Flexibility and efficiency of use 7. Recognition rather than recall 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 9. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors 10. Help and documentation Answer The answer is dependent on the task chosen and we will provide a few general guidelines. Firstly, the evaluator should consider all ten Nielsen heuristics evaluation. Students may modify some of the heuristics to evaluate some specific aspects of myUnisa system. Secondly, students should consider the format that they will use for the evaluation. The easiest is to construct a fill-in questionnaire listing the heuristics and then giving it to a few other myUnisa users or students (including yourself) to complete. After the evaluation you could compile a list of all the usability problems that have been identified and then sort them according to their impact or severity. You can also sort the list according to how easy (or costly) it will be to fix the usability problems. You will then be able to present to the myUnisa development team a list of usability problems that are rated as severe and easy to fix at the top (i.e. high priority problems) to not severe and difficult to fix at the bottom (or low priority or costly-to-fix problems) 60 61 62 63 2022 Assignment 4 All Prescribed Chapters 1.
