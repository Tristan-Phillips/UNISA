J K |[L |[M Wl als oo Figure 2: Depth First Search Assume that loops are detected, that is, already expanded nodes will not be expanded again. Nodes are generated in the the order Down, Right, Up, and Left. For example, if node F is expanded, nodes are generated: B (Down), and I (Up), and E (Left). Take note that there are no nodes right of . Diagonal moves are not permitted. i. Suppose the start node is node M, and the goal node is node G. List the first 4 nodes (after M) in the order they are generated for a non-recursive based depth- first search. (4) ii. Does the search above discover an optimal solution to the problem? Justify your answer. (3)","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
