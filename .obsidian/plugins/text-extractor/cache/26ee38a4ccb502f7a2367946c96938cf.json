In response to this charter, we have also placed curriculum transformation high on the agenda. For your information, curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemology and philosophy. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both the programme and module levels, as a phased-in approach. You will notice the implementation thereof in your modules, and we encourage you to fully embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa. 1 INTRODUCTION TO THE MODULE 1.1 Welcome Dear Student Welcome to COS3751: Techniques of Artiﬁcial Intelligence. Mastery of the content in this module will provide you with a basic understanding of some of the standard techniques of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, including knowledge representation and reasoning, state-space searching, and automated learning. We wish you every success in your studies! 1.2 Getting Started You should endeavour to log into myUnisa as often as possible to interact with your fellow students, as well as your e-tutor. You can start at the main Unisa website, namely http://www.unisa.ac.za/, and then click on the myUnisa orange block. This will take you to the myUnisa website. Otherwise, to go to the myUnisa website directly, go to https://my.unisa.ac.za/. Now you should be able to log in to myUnisa using your student number and password. You will see COS3751-20-S1/COS3751-20-S2 in the row of modules displayed in the orange blocks at the top of the webpage. Select the sites menu item if you cannot ﬁnd the module you require.

Russel & P. Norvig, Pearson Education, 2016. At the time of going to print, the latest edition for this book is the third edition. However, the fourth edition was scheduled for release in late 2019. We encourage you to please buy the latest edition of the book, however, you will still be able to work from the third edition without any problems. Since time is limited in a semester, you need to obtain a copy of this book as a matter of urgency. The Study @ Unisa brochure contains a list of Unisa booksellers. If you cannot get hold of a copy of the prescribed book, please contact the Unisa Prescribed Book Section as soon as possible. (Their contact details are also in Study @ Unisa.) This module makes use of chapters 1 to 9, and chapter 18 of the third edition of the prescribed book. Updates for the fourth edition will be communicated as soon as possible. Each learning unit on myUnisa provides an indication of the chapter(s) that should be studied. Each assignment provides the relevant chapters from the prescribed book that should be studied in order to complete the assignment. 4.3 Online material Apart from the prescribed book, all the study material you will need for COS3751 will be made available on the COS3751 website on myUnisa. This tutorial letter (101) will be available in Oﬃcial Study Material. The other study material (e.g. Tutorial Letters 102, 103, 201, 202, etc.) will be made available in Additional Resources during the course of the semester. 5 4.4 Printed support material Some of the study material, in particular Tutorial Letter 101, is provided in printed format, allowing you to read it even if you are not online. The printed study material is sent to you at the beginning of the semester, but you should not wait for it before you start studying - you can go online as soon as you have registered and ﬁnd all your study material there. The printed material sent to you is just an oﬄine copy of the formal content for this online module. 4.5 Library services and resource information The Unisa Library oﬀers a range of information services and resources: • For brief information, go to http://www.unisa.ac.za/brochures/studies. • For detailed information, go to the Unisa website at http://www.unisa.ac.za/ and click on Library. • for research support and services (e.g. Personal Librarians and literature search services), go to http://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/corporate/default/Library/Library-services/Research-support The Library has compiled numerous library guides: • request and ﬁnd library material/download recommended material: http://libguides.unisa. ac.za/request/request • postgraduate information services: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za/request/postgrad • ﬁnding and using library resources and tools: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za/Research_ skills • Frequently asked questions about the Library: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za/ask • Services to students living with disabilities: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za/disability Important contact information: • https://libguides.unisa.ac.za/ask - ask a Librarian • Lib-help@unisa.ac.za - technical problems accessing library online services • Library-enquiries@unisa.ac.za - general library related queries • Library-ﬁnes@unisa.ac.za - for queries related to library ﬁnes and payments 6 COS3751/101/3/2020 5 HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 5.1 What does it mean to study online? Studying fully online modules diﬀers considerably from studying some of your other modules at Unisa. • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All of your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may not submit a physical hard-copy of your assignments. • All of the communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will commu- nicate with you by e-mail, or use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these ways to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 5.2 The myUnisa tools you will use We will mainly be using the Lessons tool, which provides the content of, and assessments for, your module. At times you will be directed to join discussions with your fellow students, and to complete activities and assessments before continuing with the module. It is crucial that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you do so at least once a week, to do the following: • Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife email account so that you receive announcement emails on your cell phone. • Complete the Discussion Forum activities. When you complete the activities for each learning unit, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers oﬄine, but you will need to go online to post your messages. To this end we provide a Social Cafe where you can socialise with other students taking this module. • Complete other online activities. For certain learning unit activities, you may need to post something on the Blog tool, take a quiz or complete a survey under the Self-Assessment tool. Do not skip these activities, because they will help you complete the assignments and activities for the module. • We hope that by giving you extra ways of studying the material and practising all of the activities, you will succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module you MUST go online regularly, to complete the activities and assignments on time. 6 ASSESSMENT Assessment for COS3751 consists of four assessment opportunities. In particular, there are three assignments which are formative assessment opportunities and one sit-down venue-based examination which is the summative assessment opportunity. 7 6.1 Suggested study plan A semester is 13 weeks in duration which should give you enough time to work your way through the material and subject matter. Week 1 starts on 03 February 2020 for semester 1, and on 14 July 2020 for semester 2. Here is a break-down of the formal activities and assignments, as they occur in the semester: Week Content Additional Tasks 1 Learning Unit 0 and 1 2 Learning Unit 2 3 Learning Unit 3 4 Learning Unit 4 5 Learning Unit 5 Assignment 01 due at start of week 6 Learning Unit 6 7 Learning Unit 7 8 Learning Unit 8 9 Learning Unit 9 Assignment 02 due at start of week 10 Learning Unit 10 11 Review Self-assessment assignment. Do not submit! 12 Review 13 Review 6.2 Assignments The assignments for COS3751 are available online – see section 6.2.1 below. You need to start working on the assignments as soon as possible, as you work your way through the material. Assignments 01 and 02 are compulsory, and will contribute to your year mark. The self- assessment assignment will not contribute to your year mark – however, it covers material that will be assessed in the summative assessment (i.e. the exam). This means you have to complete it and use the model solutions that will be provided to determine your level of understanding of the work. The following table provides particulars about the assignments you need to submit for each semester: Semester Assignment Due Date Unique Number 1 01 2020-03-02 757471 02 2020-03-30 879267 2 01 2020-08-11 860759 02 2020-09-07 624233 Assignments are not mini-exams, and we do not treat them as such. Their main purpose is to be a learning exercise. Use this opportunity to gain a better understanding of the material covered in an assignment by asking questions and pointing out to us which parts of the assignment you found diﬃcult. A satisfactory assignment is one in which you put in a serious eﬀort to answer all the questions. We reserve the right to mark only a subset of the questions for each assignment. However, we will not reveal this before the closing date of the assignment. It is therefore important that you attempt to answer all of the questions in each assignment. The tutorial matter to study for each assignment appears in the study plan speciﬁed above. Give yourself enough time to do the assignments properly, realising that an hour or two will not be 8 COS3751/101/3/2020 suﬃcient. Some assignment questions may require additional research, which can be in the form of sources such as articles, books and web sites. It is important that the sources used contain recent and relevant information. Web addresses change frequently, so some URLs noted in the textbook and tutorial matter may have changed by the time you access them. You are encouraged to do some research on your own as and when needed. Follow the procedures outlined herein, in Tutorial Letter COSALL/301/4/2020 and in the Studies @ Unisa brochure when submitting your assignments. Assignments should reach us by the due dates. Please do not contact us for extensions. Important: In the event that due dates are extended as a result of administrative problems, please attempt to keep to the original due dates as published for COS3751. 6.2.1 Assignment questions The questions for Assignments 01 and 02 and for the self-assessment assignment are speciﬁed in Tutorial Letter 102. This is available under Additional Resources on the module website. 6.2.2 Plagiarism Do not attempt to submit answers from already published assignment solutions. This is plagiarism and you will be subjected to disciplinary action. An answer that resembles a published solution will also be awarded 0%. Do not simply copy from online sources – there are many excellent sources on the web which explain and may even provide solutions to the questions in the assignments. However, submitting that as your own work is not only plagiarism; it also does not help you to prepare for the exam. 6.2.3 Submission Assignments 01 and 02 have to be submitted on myUnisa. Assignments that are emailed to us, or that are submitted as hard-copy will be awarded 0%. 6.3 Examination admission Entrance to the examination is dependent on completion and submission of one of the two assignments: If you do not complete an assignment and submit it on myUnisa, you will not be allowed to write the ﬁnal examination. Exam admission is determined in the ﬁrst week of April for the ﬁrst semester, and in the ﬁrst week of September for the second semester, so you must submit an assignment before that to be considered for exam admission. 6.4 Final mark calculation Your semester mark is calculated as follows: S = A1 2 × A2 2 where A1 is your mark for assignment 01 and A2 is your mark for assignment 02. In other words, each assignment counts half of your semester mark. 9 Your ﬁnal mark is calculated as: F = 4E 5 + S 5 where E is your exam mark, and S is your semester mark. In other words, your semester mark contributes 20% and your exam mark 80% of your ﬁnal mark. Copyright c⃝ UNISA 2020 10","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
