This examination opportunity is afforded to you, and no one else but you. Having an- other person complete the work will result in disciplinary action, and potentially suspension or expulsion from the university. 2. Do not forget to do the Honesty declaration. 3. Read the questions very carefully and make sure you answer them fully. 4. Follow the instructions as sent to you by the university (and as in the examination tutorial letter) to submit your answers. 5. Make sure you leave yourself enough time to upload your answers before the end of the allowed time. 6. There are 5 pages. [TURN PAGE] 2 COS3751 May/June 2020 Question 1 State Spaces [21] (a) Three jackals and three goats come to a river. There is a boat on their side of the river that can be used by either one or two animals. All six animals must cross the river. However the jackals must not outnumber the goats at any time, in any place. It is ﬁne to have an equal number of each, and it is also ﬁne to have more goats than jackals in a given place. The “no goats” situation can be treated as a special case. We want to determine how the animals should use the boat to ensure all of them cross the river safely. i. Deﬁne a non-graphical (i.e. no pictures) state representation for the problem. Your state representation should be such that a search algorithm will be able to start the search at any given state. (2) ii. Defend your choice by showing that the level of abstraction is sufﬁcient (Hint: Your state representation should only encode the necessary information). (2) iii. Deﬁne appropriate actions for this problem. Using the successor function Result(a, S) 7→ S′, show how applying the action a to state S results in state S′. Hint: Provide an example action a, a state S, and the resulting state S′ (2) iv. Using the state representation you deﬁned above, draw a search tree that shows the entire search space beginning at the start node. Include all the possible states, however, do not show the illegal states (in which jackals outnumber goats on either side of the river). (15) Question 2 Searching [12] Perform an A ∗ search on the graph below. The start node is N and the goal node is F .

At each step, provide the frontier, and show which node is selected for expansion. Provide the ﬁnal path from the start to the goal. Use Table 1 for the ˆh values for each node in the graph.

Question 3 Adversarial Search [24] Consider the game tree below and then answer the questions that follow (the static utility values for the leaf nodes are provided below each leaf node). MAX nodes are drawn as squares, and MIN nodes are drawn as circles. (a) Why are Alpha/Beta pruning searches needed? (2) (b) Discuss a real world situation where Alpha/Beta pruning could be used. (2) (c) Using the provided search tree, show how the alpha/beta search proceeds from the start (root) node. Your answer must proceed in a step-by-step fashion showing the α/β values for each node as the search progresses (i.e. the α/β values as they propagate down the tree to child nodes), as well as which values are returned to the parent nodes. Also clearly indicate the tests for α/β cuts. The search should progress in a left to right fashion.

The variables for the puzzle. (5) ii. The domains for the puzzle. (2) iii. The constraints for this puzzle. (5) iv. Provide the solution to this crypt-arithmetic puzzle, show all the steps you took to arrive at the answer (also show which heuristic you employed, and your backtrack- ing strategy (if used)). (10) [TURN PAGE] 5 COS3751 May/June 2020 Question 5 Resolution Refutation [21] The following English statements are given: 1. Anything that anyone eats and is not killed by eating it, is food. 2. John eats any kind of food. 3. Apples are food. 4. Chicken is food. 5. Bill eats peanuts, and is not killed by eating it. 6. Sue eats everything that Bill eats. (a) Convert the statements to First Order Logic statements. The ﬁrst statement has been provided already, convert the rest. Remember to standardise your variables. (5) 1. ∀y, z[eats(y, z) ∧ ¬killedf romeating(y, z) ⇒ f ood(z)] (b) Convert all of the FOL statements above to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) (includ- ing the statement that was provided). Hint: First think carefully what it means for a statement to be in CNF. (7) (c) Use resolution refutation to prove that John eats peanuts, using the assumptions in the paragraph above.
