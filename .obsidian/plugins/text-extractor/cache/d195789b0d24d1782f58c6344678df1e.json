PPPeee0eee0e 0 = | Â£21:36 S1\" site at (https://mymodules.unisa.ac.za/portal/site/COS1501-20- S1) at 27-Jul-2020 10:42 Dear students, The university has confirmed that the October/November examination will also be an ONLINE examination. If you get a deferment to the October/November examination, you have to pass the exam, as there will be no further deferment. If you fail, you will have to re- register for the module in 2021. So please start preparing for the examination early enough. At this point we do not know which format will be chosen for the online exam. Should it not be the Online Assessment tool, as in semester 1 that will be used, you will be informed early enough. Please login to myUnisa regularly, and check your mylife email address regularly, as there will be important information regarding the upcoming exam.
