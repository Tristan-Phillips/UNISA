This module is at the intersection of the sub-disciplines of Information Systems and Computer Science. Since this is a third-level module, we assume that students have background knowledge and skills from the first-year module, Human-Computer Interaction I (INF1520). This module differs from INF1520 in that it covers the topics in more depth and focuses on applied knowledge. It concerns the wider context of human-computer interaction, namely interaction design. Because this is a fully online module, you will need to use myUnisa to study and complete the learning activities for this course. Visit the website for INF3720 on myUnisa frequently. The website for your module is INF3720-22-Y1. Hence, the assignments will be uploaded on myUnisa under the “Additional Resource tool” during the year. 1.1 Getting started Owing to the online nature of this module, you can find your study material on myUnisa. Go to the website at https://my.unisa.ac.za and log in using your student number and password. Click on \"myModules\" at the top of the web page and then on \"Sites\" in the top right corner. In the new window, click on the grey Star icon next to the modules you want displayed on your navigation bar. Close the window in the top right corner. Then select the option \"Reload to see your updated favourite sites\". Now go to your navigation bar and click on the module you want to open. 2 OVERVIEW OF INF3720 2.1 Purpose Students who have completed this module successfully will be able to apply their practical skills and theoretical knowledge to design interactive computer-based products, from the requirements analysis stage through to creating a prototype of the system. They can evaluate existing interactive systems and prototypes using a variety of evaluation techniques. This module provides intermediate knowledge, skills and values, which will support further studies and design applications in the sector of Information Systems and Information Technology, as part of the BSc or BCom qualification. These competencies therefore contribute to the development of communities with business support, design, evaluation and research skills. Another important goal is to nurture graduate attributes such as deep understanding, critical thinking, applied knowledge and metacognition (cf. https://www.saqa.org.za/docs/genpubs/2009/graduate_attributes.pdf). Therefore, formative assessments do not only “test” students’ knowledge but are designed to improve and evaluate your higher-order thinking skills as per Bloom’s taxonomy. The assessments are therefore designed to make you reflect, analyse, synthesise and apply. You will sometimes even have to look for more information on the internet, and also check the textbook's index. You will often have to read a whole section or chapter in the textbook and then integrate the various concepts in order to answer a question. 4 As lecturers we have to report on how our assignment and exam questions reflect Bloom's taxonomy of higher order thinking skills (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy). On this level of your studies the focus is not so much on knowledge anymore but shifts to comprehension, analysis, application and evaluation. 2.2 Outcomes For this module, you will have to master several outcomes: • Specific outcome 1: Describe interaction design with a clear design process path and relate it to the field of human-computer interaction. • Specific outcome 2: Critically evaluate the design of collaborative technologies to support communication and collaboration between people. • Specific outcome 3: Identify and analyse the affective aspects of an existing interactive system, and design affective interface elements for a new interactive system. • Specific outcome 4: Gather data to support the design of interactive systems design. • Specific outcome 5: Explore the problem space to understand a product’s requirements that underpin its design and construction. • Specific outcome 6: Conduct an evaluation of a user interface or interactive system. 2.3 Study plan The outcomes for this module are covered in the chapters of the prescribed book (provided in Section 5.2) that are listed below.

In response to this charter, we have placed curriculum transformation high on the teaching and learning agenda. Curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both programme and module levels as a phased- in approach. You will notice a marked change in the teaching and learning strategy implemented by Unisa, together with how the content is conceptualised in your modules. We encourage you to embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa in a responsive way within the framework of transformation.

This is also true for first-time students to Unisa. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e-learning institution. Unlike face-to-face/contact institutions, Unisa is somewhat different. It is a mega university, and all our programmes are offered through a blended learning mode or fully online learning mode. It is for this reason that we thought it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support so that you can seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. In this regard we offer a specialised student support programme to students entering Unisa for the first time. We refer to this programme as Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme. The FYE is designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE programmes are currently offered: • FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE • FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated. • FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (eg videos on how to submit assignments online). 12 • FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e-mail to fye@unisa.ac.za 7. HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 7.1 What does it mean to study fully online? Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa. • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office. • All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you via e-mail and SMS, and use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these platforms to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 7.2 myUnisa tools The main tool that we will use is the Lessons tool. This tool will provide the content of and the assessments for your module. At times you will be directed to join discussions with fellow students and complete activities and assessments before you can continue with the module. It is very important that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you log in at least once a week to do the following: • Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife e-mail account so that you receive the announcement e-mails on your cellphone. • Do the Discussion Forum activities. When you do the activities for each learning unit, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you will need to go online to post your messages. • Do other online activities. For some of the learning unit activities you might need to post something on the Blog tool, take a quiz or complete a survey under the Self-Assessment tool. Do not skip these activities because they will help you complete the assignments and the activities for the module. We hope that by giving you extra ways to study the material and practise all the activities, this will help you succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module, you MUST go online regularly to complete the activities and assignments on time. INF3707/101/0/2022 13 8. ASSESSMENT 8.1 Assessment plan Formative assessment will be conducted using take-home structured question assignments and multiple-choice questions. Summative assessment will be conducted online using a timed take home assessment. The examination subminimum mark is 40%. The final mark composition is: • Formative assessment: 20% • Summative assessment: 80% The following is a breakdown of the formal assessment activities as they become due during the year: All assignments are compulsory. Assignment Due dates Unique number Weight 01 To be provided 10% 02 To be provided 35% 03 To be provided 35% 04 To be provided 20% *Because this is an online module, the assignments are not provided in this tutorial letter. Instead, the assignments are provided online as they become due. You will see them when you go online. 8.2 Year mark and final examination Your year mark = 20% x (Assignment 01 (10%) + Assignment 02 (35%) + Assignment 03 (35%) + Assignment 04 (20%)) Examination mark = 80 % x Examination mark (out of 100) Final mark = Year mark + Examination mark 9. CONCLUSION Do not hesitate to contact us by e-mail if you are experiencing problems with the content of this tutorial letter or with any academic aspect of the module. We wish you a fascinating and satisfying journey through the learning material, and trust that you will complete the module successfully. Enjoy the journey! 14 APPENDIX: Frequently asked questions • What do I do if I cannot find the prescribed book? See Section 5.2 • What will happen if I fail to submit my assignment on time? If the myUnisa system is down when you try to submit an assignment, do not contact the lecturers. Wait until the problem is resolved and then submit your assignment as soon as possible. We are usually aware of problems with myUnisa. If you submit your assignment late for any other reason, include a note with the assignment in which you give the reasons for the late submission. No assignment will be marked (a mark of ZERO will be awarded) after the solutions for the assignment have been published. This is usually a week or two after the due date of the assignment. • What if there are mistakes in the marking of assignments? (Do NOT resubmit your assignment to Assignments Department!) We use a team of external markers that are subcontracted to mark assignments. For this reason, there may be inconsistency in the marking style of individual markers. We request that students only query assignment marking where the marks will change significantly (more than 5%). Please follow the RE-MARK PROCEDURE. The RE-Mark procedure: e-Mail your marked assignment (or a photocopy of it) TOGETHER WITH A LETTER stating your marking dilemma with the specified questions of the assignment to the module email. • What if I don't receive my study material or I lose it? Visit myUnisa and download an electronic copy (PDF file). • May I submit my assignment by e-mail? No, never do that. © 2022 Unisa","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
