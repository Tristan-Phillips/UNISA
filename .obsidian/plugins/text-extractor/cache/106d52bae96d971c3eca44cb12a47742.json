Briefly explain usability goals and user experience goals in the context of interaction design? Distinguish the difference between them. [1] 2. What makes the design of an interactive product good or bad? Use practical example to explain your answer. [1] 3. What is meant by the term learnability and how is it essential as a design goal of interactive design. Illustrate your argument with an example. [1] 4. In practice, Interaction Design is a process aimed at bringing usability to interactive products. Identify and briefly explain the four steps involved in this process. [1] 5 Effectiveness and efficiency are two of four usability goals identified by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015). With an example explain and distinguish these two goals. [1] Long questions (5) 1. Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) have asserted that that for interaction design to succeed many disciplines need to be involved from engineering, computer science, information sciences, to social sciences or even graphic design. Give the importance and downside of this assertion. [20] 2. Refer to Question 1, explain how experts such as psychologists, graphic designers and teachers would be required in the development of a kids computer learning game. [20] 3. Consider a Laptop Computer as an interactive product you would apply usability criteria. Identify three user experience amongst those outlined by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) and explain your experience as a user. [20] 4. The disciplines of interaction design and Human-computer interaction are closely related. Discuss the relationship and outline the difference between them particularly with regard to usability. [20] 5. In his seminal book The Design of Everyday Things (1988), Donald Norman coins the concept of Affordance. Explain what affordance means as a design principle essential in the interaction design process. Use a practical case of a website page, a desktop program or a mobile application to support your explanation. [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. Both explain usability goals and user experience goals are essential elements for the success of the design of interactive products. The major difference or nuance between them lies principally in the fact that Usability concerns objectively task-based interactions or the ability to do something well and easily hence terms like effectiveness, efficiency, learnerability, safety..While User experience refers subjectively to how a user feels when they interact with a product, their emotional connection with it; that is why adjectives like fun, enjoyable, cool, and so on are used for user experience goals. 2. As argued by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015), what makes an interactive product good or bad is primarily its Usability. This is viewed the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness,efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. the ease of use and learnability of an interactive product by its end-users. In other words, a product is good or bad first from the perspective of its users or consumers, the degree to which can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use. This is true for instance for websites, software applications as well as devices such as computers, TVs or mobile phones. 3. The concept learnerability refers to how the interactive product or system is easy to learn how to use. This is one of the essential usability criteria. Take for example a fancy looking TV set with a remote control full of buttons that the user would not understand nor manipulate. The TV becomes useless to them. 4. Indeed, Interaction Design is a process that consists in bringing usability to interactive products. The four steps that make up this process are: - Identifying needs and establishing requirements. - Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements. - Building interactive versions of the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed. - Evaluating what is being built throughout the process. 5. The terms effectiveness and efficiency are quite related. Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) have identified them as two of four usability golas/criteria - Effectiveness: The accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals. How a product/system is at doing what it is meant to do. - Efficiency: The resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals. How many steps are required to perform tasks. Answers long questions (5) 1. As indicated by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) nowadays more than before, the success of interaction design relies on the contribution of skills from various relevant disciplines be it engineering, computer science, information sciences, to social sciences or even graphic design. This allows everyone in such a team has different skills, and brings unique specialist knowledge or expertise to the table, thus allowing a very rounded view. A multidisciplinary design approach seeks to integrate the skills and methodology of designersfrom multiple disciplines into a collaborative effort.Multidisciplinary designers need to understand how diverse areas of expertise can come together to solve complex design problems The only downside of multidisciplinary interaction design 2. Referring to Question 1, specialists such as psychlogists, teachers and graphic designers would contributes their expertise in the development of a kids computer learning game as follows:. Psychologist: as a specialist who understands huma behaviour, cognitive and emotional processes, a psychologist would suggest appriopriate, safe and effective ways to combine education and leisure in the games. Teacher: as a professional would propose methods et devices to convey knowledge effectively to children. Graphic Designer: would devise designs that would be appropriate for kids, that would not only entice them but also entertain them and push them to learn by playing. 3. Here the student will choose and explain three user experiences from amongst others : - Satisfying - Enjoyable - Fun - Entertaining - Helpful - Motivating - aesthetically pleasing - supportive of creativity - rewarding - emotionally fulfilling 4. Both Interaction Design and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) are concerned with designing products/systems that usable to users. Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a subset of Interaction Design. Human Computer Interaction (HCI) involves the study, planning, and design of the interaction between people (users) and computers. In other words, HCI is a sociotechnological discipline whose goal is to bring the power of computers and communications systems to people in ways and forms that are both accessible and useful in our working, learning, communicating, and recreational lives Interaction Design is the practice of understanding users' needs and goals. designing tools for users to achieve those goals. Viewed this, Interaction design is much wider than include Human Computer Interaction. While the latter is limited to computer systems, the former includes any interactive products. 5. Affordance means to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use is. It refers to physical cues (eg. Being able to click a button on a mouse). Virtual affordance refers to visual signs (eg. Being able to press a link in a browser – in this case ensuring the link is highlighted in some way. Usually underlined and in a different colour to rest of text).","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
