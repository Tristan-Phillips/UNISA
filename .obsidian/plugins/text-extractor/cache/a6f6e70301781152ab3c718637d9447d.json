IN CLOSING ............................................................................................................................... 20 4 1 INTRODUCTION Dear Student Unisa is a comprehensive open distance e-learning (CODeL) higher education institution. The comprehensiveness of our curricula encapsulates a range of offerings, from strictly vocational to strictly academic certificates, diplomas and degrees. Unisa's \"openness\" and its distance eLearning character result in many students registering at Unisa who may not have had an opportunity to enrol in higher education. Our CODeL character implies that our programmes are carefully planned and structured to ensure success for students ranging from the under-prepared but with potential to the sufficiently prepared. Teaching and learning in a CODeL context involve multiple modes of delivery ranging from blended learning to fully online. As a default position, all post graduate programmes are offered fully online with no printed study materials, while undergraduate programmes are offered in a blended mode of delivery where printed study materials are augmented with online teaching and learning via the learner management system – myUnisa. In some instances, undergraduate programmes are offered fully online as well. Furthermore, our programmes are aligned with the vision, mission and values of the University. Unisa's commitment to serve humanity and shape futures combined with a clear appreciation of our location on the African continent, Unisa's graduates have distinctive graduate qualities which include • independent, resilient, responsible and caring citizens who are able to fulfil and serve in multiple roles in their immediate and future local, national and global communities • having a critical understanding of their location on the African continent with its histories, challenges and potential in relation to globally diverse contexts • the ability to critically analyse and evaluate the credibility and usefulness of information and data from multiple sources in a globalised world with its ever- increasing information and data flows and competing worldviews • how to apply their discipline-specific knowledges competently, ethically and creatively to solve real-life problems • an awareness of their own learning and developmental needs and future potential COS1512 is an online module. Whether a module is offered either as blended (meaning that we use a combination of printed and online material to engage with you) or online (all information is available via the internet), we use myUnisa as our virtual campus. This is an online system that is used to administer, document and deliver educational material to you and support engagement with you. Look out for information from your lecturer as well as other Unisa platforms to determine how to access the virtual myUnisa module site. Information on the tools that will be available to engage with the lecturer and fellow students to support your learning will also be communicated via various platforms. COS1512/101/0/2023 5 You are encouraged to log into the module site on myUnisa regularly (that is, at least three times per week). Because this is a fully online module, you will need to use myUnisa to study and complete the learning activities for this module. Please visit the website for COS1512 on myUnisa at least three times per week. The website for COS1512 is COS1512-23-Y. We wish you every success with your studies! 2 MODULE OVERVIEW 2.1 Purpose This module introduces students to the design, implementation and evaluation of algorithms- based, structured object-oriented computer programs, with the fundamentals of simple data structures, (including object-orientation). Students are equipped to think logically, creatively, and conceptually and to recognize the design rules, techniques, and components in order to compose and present a functional working program solution to a perceived computing problem of a client, for the application of these programs in the industry’s process systems and organizational information systems, to specific standards (such as user-friendly, robust, solution specific, and to the satisfaction of the client). This module provides core compulsory and introductory knowledge, skills and values that will support further studies and applications in the sector of object-oriented programming computing, in the field of computer science, as part of the B-degree. COS1512 focuses on providing an introduction to objects and the object-oriented programming environment using C++ as programming language. The following topics are included: • file I/O streams as an introduction to objects and classes; • using pre-defined classes such as string and vector; C-strings, pointers and dynamic arrays; • ADTs (i.e. user-defined classes including the functions and operators for these classes as well as separate compilation); • recursion; • single inheritance, • and function and class templates. 2.2 Outcomes For this module, you will have to master several outcomes: Specific outcome 1: You can design a logical solution to a simple programming problem, making appropriate assumptions. Assessment criteria: • You can interpret a problem description which specifies the requirements of a program; • You can identify all steps necessary to solve a problem and order the steps in the correct 6 logical sequence; • You can write down the logical sequence of operations that a computer should perform to solve a particular problem; • You can apply object-oriented principles during problem solving. Specific outcome 2: You can write C++ program code, demonstrating the principles of good programming style. Assessment criteria: • You can use the different C++ programming constructs appropriately and correctly, in order to implement a solution to a programming problem; • You can write functions and use them in a program; • You can define classes and use object-oriented principles to implement programming problems; • You can recognise/locate errors in a program and correct them. Specific outcome 3: You can demonstrate an understanding of the theory underlying the basic programming concepts. Assessment criteria: • You can explain the purpose of a particular C++ programming construct and identify problem descriptions where they are applicable. • You can define relevant programming concepts. The specific learning objectives for each chapter in the prescribed book for COS1512 in order to reach the above learning outcomes are given in more detail in the study guide included in Tutorial Letter 102, available under Additional Resources on the COS1512 course website. 3 CURRICULUM TRANSFORMATION Unisa has implemented a transformation charter, in terms of which the university has placed curriculum transformation high on the teaching and learning agenda. Curriculum transformation includes student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. All of these will be phased in at both programme and module levels, and as a result of this you will notice a marked change in the teaching and learning strategy implemented by Unisa, together with the way in which the content is conceptualised in your modules. We encourage you to embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa in a responsive way within the framework of transformation.

This is also true in the case of students enrolling at Unisa for the first time. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e-learning institution, and it is very different from face-to-face/contact institutions. It is a mega university, and all our programmes are offered through either blended learning or fully online learning. It is for this reason that we thought it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support to help them seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. We therefore offer a specialised student support programme to students enrolling at Unisa for the first time – this is Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme, designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE services are currently offered: • FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE • FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated. • FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (e.g. videos on how to submit assessments online). • FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e- mail to fye@unisa.ac.za . 7. STUDY PLAN COS1511 is a co-requisite for COS1512 registration. This means that if you have not yet passed COS1511, you have to register for both COS1511 and COS1512 simultaneously. If you do not have any programming background or experience, it is highly recommended to first pass COS1511 before attempting COS1512, because COS1512 builds on knowledge that we expect you to have acquired in COS1511. 12 If you are registered for both COS1511 and COS1512, please note that you must study the Study Guide for COS1511 up to at least Chapter 23 before you start with COS1512. Here is a study program for students registered for both COS1511 and COS1512. We also provide a study program for students registered for COS1512 only below. Note that due dates for assignments for students registered for COS1512 only and for students registered for both COS1511 and COS1512 simultaneously, are the same. See the COS1512 course website for these dates. 7.1 Study programme for students registered for both COS1511 and COS1512 Week Date COS1511 COS1512 1 6 March 2023 Install software Chapters 1 to 4 Install software and AutoThinking game Chapter 1 in Savitch 2 13 March 2023 Chapters 5 to 7 Play AutoThinking game 3 20 March 2023 Chapters 8 to 11 Play AutoThinking game 4 27 March 2023 Chapters 12 to 14 Play AutoThinking game 5 3 April 2023 Chapters 15 to 16 Play AutoThinking game 6 10 April 2023 Complete Assignment 1 for COS1511 (Chapters 1 to 16) Play AutoThinking game 7 17 April 2023 Chapters 17 to 18 8 24 April 2023 Chapters 19 to 20 9 1 May 2023 Chapters 21 to 23 10 8 May 2023 Complete Assignment 2 for COS1511 (Chapters 17 to 23) 11 15 May 2023 Section 4.6 in chapter 4 and section 5.5 in chapter 5 in Savitch Complete Assignment 1 for COS1512 12 22 May 2023 Chapters 24 to 26 Chapter 6 in Savitch 13 29 May 2023 Chapter 27 14 5 June 2023 Complete Assignment 3 for COS1511 (Chapters 24 to 27) COS1512/101/0/2023 13 15 12 June 2023 Sections 8.1 and 8.3, plus the subsection Converting Between string Objects and C Strings in section 8.2 in chapter 8 on Savitch 16 19 June 2023 Chapter 9 in Savitch 17 26 June 2023 Complete Assignment 2 for COS1512 (chapters 4, 5, 6, 8 &9 in Savitch) 18 3 July 2023 Chapters 28 to 30 19 10 July 2023 Chapter 10 in Savitch 20 17 July 2023 Chapter 11 in Savitch 21 24 July 2023 Chapter 12 in Savitch 22 31 July 2023 Appendices 7 and 8 in Savitch 23 7 August 2023 Complete Assignment 3 for COS1512 (Chapters 10, 11 & 12 in Savitch) 24 14 August 2023 Complete Assignment 3 for COS1512 (Chapters 10, 11 & 12 in Savitch) 25 21 August 2023 Chapter 14 in Savitch 26 28 August 2023 Chapter 15 in Savitch 27 4 September 2023 Chapter 17 in Savitch 28 11 September 2023 Complete Assignment 4 for COS1512 (Chapters 14, 15 & 17 in Savitch) 29 18 September 2023 Complete Assignment 4 for COS1511 (Chapters 1 to 30) 30 25 September 2023 to exam Revision Revision 14 7.2 Study programme for students registered only for COS1512 Week Date COS1512 1 6 March 2023 Install software and AutoThinking game Link to AutoThinking game: https://www.autothinking.ut.ee/ Chapter 1 in Savitch 2 13 March 2023 Section 4.6 in chapter 4 Play AutoThinking game 3 20 March 2023 Section 5.5 in chapter 5 in Savitch Play AutoThinking game 4 27 March 2023 Chapter 6 in Savitch Play AutoThinking game 5 3 April 2023 Chapter 6 in Savitch Play AutoThinking game 6 10 April 2023 Sections 8.1 and 8.3, plus the subsection Converting Between string Objects and C Strings in section 8.2 in chapter 8 on Savitch Play AutoThinking game 7 17 April 2023 Sections 8.1 and 8.3, plus the subsection Converting Between string Objects and C Strings in section 8.2 in chapter 8 on Savitch 8 24 April 2023 Chapter 9 in Savitch 9 1 May 2023 Complete Assignment 1 for COS1512 10 8 May 2023 Chapter 9 in Savitch 11 15 May 2023 Chapter 10 in Savitch 12 22 May 2023 Chapter 10 in Savitch 13 29 May 2023 Complete Assignment 2 for COS1512 (chapters 4, 5, 6, 8 &9 in Savitch) 14 5 June 2023 Complete Assignment 2 for COS1512 (chapters 4, 5, 6, 8 &9 in Savitch) 15 12 June 2023 Chapter 11 in Savitch 16 19 June 2023 Chapter 11 in Savitch 17 26 June 2023 Chapter 12 in Savitch 18 3 July 2023 Chapter 12 in Savitch 19 10 July 2023 Appendices 7 and 8 in Savitch 20 17 July 2023 Complete Assignment 3 for COS1512 (Chapters 10, 11 & 12 in Savitch) 21 24 July 2023 Complete Assignment 3 for COS1512 (Chapters 10, 11 & 12 in Savitch) 22 31 July 2023 Chapter 14 in Savitch Open Rubric COS1512/101/0/2023 15 23 7 August 2023 Chapter 14 in Savitch 24 14 August 2023 Chapter 15 in Savitch 25 21 August 2023 Chapter 15 in Savitch 26 28 August 2023 Chapter 17 in Savitch 27 4 September 2023 Chapter 17 in Savitch 28 11 September 2023 Complete Assignment 4 for COS1512 (Chapters 14, 15 & 17 in Savitch) 29 18 September 2023 to exam Revision 8 HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 8.1 What does it mean to study fully online? Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa. • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office. • All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you via e-mail and SMS, and use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these platforms to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 8.2 myUnisa tools The main tool that we will use is the Lessons tool. This tool will provide the content of and the assessments for your module. At times, you will be directed to join discussions with fellow students and complete activities and assessments before you can continue with the module. It is very important that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you log in at least once a week and preferably more times to do the following: • Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife e-mail account so that you receive the announcement e-mails on your cellphone. • Do the Discussion Forum activities. When you do the activities for each learning unit, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you will need to go online to post your messages. • Do other online activities. For some of the learning unit activities you might need to post something on the Blog tool, take a quiz or complete a survey under the Self-Assessment 16 tool. Do not skip these activities because they will help you complete the assignments and the activities for the module. • Attend the online lectures. Online lectures are offered by the e-tutors once their contracts have been activated. These lectures are also recorded for students who cannot attend when the lectures are offered, and for revision purposes. This can help you to master the study material. We hope that by giving you extra ways to study the material and practise all the activities, this will help you succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module, you MUST go online regularly to complete the activities and assignments on time. 9 ASSESSMENT 9.1 Assessment criteria The assessment criteria for this module is provided in section 2.2 showing what is expected for each learning outcome. 9.2 Assessment plan • To complete this module, you will be required to submit four assessments. • All information about when and where to submit your assessments will be made available to you via the myModules site for your module. • Due dates for assessments, as well as the actual assessments are available on the myModules site for this module. • To gain admission to the examination, you will be required to submit at least two assignment/s. • Your assignments will comprise a combination of online assessments (multiple choice questions) and practical projects (written assignments for which you write computer programs). • To gain admission to the examination, you need to obtain a year mark average of 50% for the assignments. • You will receive examination information via the myModules sites. Please watch out for announcements on how examinations for the modules for which you are registered will be conducted. • The assignments will contribute 20% towards your final mark for the module and the examination 80%. 9.3 Assessment due dates • There are no assignment due dates included in this tutorial letter. • Assignment due dates will be made available to you on the myModules landing page for this module. We envisage that the due dates will be available to you upon registration. • Please start working on your assessments as soon as you register for the module. • Log on to the myModules site for this module to obtain more information on the due dates for the submission of the assessments. COS1512/101/0/2023 17 9.4 Submission of assessments • Unisa, as a comprehensive open distance e-learning institution (CODeL), is moving towards becoming an online institution. You will therefore see that all your study material, assessments and engagements with your lecturer and fellow students will take place online. We use myUnisa as our virtual campus. • The myUnisa virtual campus will offer students access to the myModules site, where learning material will be available online and where assessments should be completed. This is an online system that is used to administer, document, and deliver educational material to students and support engagement between academics and students. • The myUnisa platform can be accessed via https://my.unisa.ac.za. Click on the myModules 2023 button to access the online sites for the modules that you are registered for. • The university undertakes to communicate clearly and as frequently as is necessary to ensure that you obtain the greatest benefit from the use of the myModules learning management system. Please access the announcements on your myModules site regularly, as this is where your lecturer will post important information to be shared with you. • When you access your myModules site for the module/s you are registered for, you will see a welcome message posted by your lecturer. Below the welcome message you will see the assessment shells for the assessments that you need to complete. Some assessments may be multiple choice, some tests, others written assessments, some forum discussions, and so on. All assessments must be completed on the assessment shells available on the respective module platforms. • To complete quiz assessments, please log on to the module site where you need to complete the assessment. Click on the relevant assessment shell (Assessment 1, Assessment 2, etc.). There will be a date on which the assessment will open for you. When the assessment is open, access the quiz online and complete it within the time available to you. Quiz assessment questions are not included in this tutorial letter (Tutorial Letter 101) and are only made available online. You must therefore access the quiz online and complete it online where the quiz has been created. • It is not advisable to use a cell phone to complete the quiz. Please use a desktop computer, tablet or laptop when completing the quiz. Students who use a cell phone find it difficult to navigate the Online Assessment tool on the small screen and often struggle to navigate between questions and successfully complete the quizzes. In addition, cell phones are more vulnerable to dropped internet connections than other devices. If at all possible, please do not use a cell phone for this assessment type. • For written assessments, please note the due date by which the assessment must be submitted. Ensure that you follow the guidelines given by your lecturer to complete the assessment. Click on the submission button on the relevant assessment shell on 18 myModules. You will then be able to upload your written assessment on the myModules site of the modules that you are registered for. Before you finalise the upload, double check that you have selected the correct file for upload. Remember, no marks can be allocated for incorrectly submitted assessments. 9.5 The assessments As indicated in section 9.2, you need to complete four assessments for this module. There are no assignments included in this tutorial letter. Because this is an online module, the assignments are not provided in this tutorial letter. Details on the assignments and due dates will be provided on the COS1512 course website on myModules. We envisage that the due dates will be available to you upon registration. 9.6 The examination Examination information and details on the format of the examination will be made available to you online via the myUnisa site. Look out for information that will be shared with you by your lecturer and e-tutors (where relevant) and for communication from the university. 9.6.1 Invigilation/proctoring Since 2020 Unisa conducts all its assessments online. Given stringent requirements from professional bodies and increased solicitations of Unisa’s students by third parties to unlawfully assist them with the completion of assignments and examinations, the University is obliged to assure its assessment integrity through the utilisation of various proctoring tools: Turnitin, Moodle Proctoring, the Invigilator App and IRIS. These tools will authenticate the student’s identity and flag suspicious behaviour to assure credibility of students’ responses during assessments. The description below is for your benefit as you may encounter any or all of these in your registered modules: Turnitin is a plagiarism software that facilitates checks for originality in students’ submissions against internal and external sources. Turnitin assists in identifying academic fraud and ghost writing. Students are expected to submit typed responses for utilisation of the Turnitin software. The Moodle Proctoring tool is a facial recognition software that authenticates students’ identity during their Quiz assessments. This tool requires access to a student’s mobile or laptop camera. Students must ensure their camera is activated in their browser settings prior to their assessments. The Invigilator “mobile application-based service does verification” of the identity of an assessment participant. The Invigilator Mobile Application detects student dishonesty-by-proxy and ensures that the assessment participant is the registered student. This invigilation tool requires students to download the app from their Play Store (Google, Huawei and Apple) on their mobile devices (camera enabled) prior to their assessment. IRIS Invigilation software verifies the identity of a student during assessment and provides for both manual and automated facial verification. It has the ability to record and review a student’s assessment session. It flags suspicious behaviour by the students for review by an academic COS1512/101/0/2023 19 administrator. IRIS software requires installation on students’ laptop devices that are enabled with a webcam. Students who are identified and flagged for suspicious dishonest behaviour arising from the invigilation and proctoring reports are referred to the disciplinary office for formal proceeding. Please note: Students must refer to their module assessment information on their myModule sites to determine which proctoring or invigilation tool will be utilised for their formative and summative assessments. 9.7 Supplementary To pass this module you need to obtain a final mark of 50%. Your exam mark will contribute 80% to the final mark and the year mark will contribute 20% to the final mark. If you do not pass the module, you may be granted a supplementary examination in the next examination period in January/February. To qualify for a supplementary examination, you need to obtain at least 40% in the October/November examination itself. 10.
