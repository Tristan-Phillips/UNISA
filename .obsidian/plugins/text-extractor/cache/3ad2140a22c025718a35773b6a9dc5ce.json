Used courtesy of the Neilsen-Norman Group Testing the iPad usability • First study was conducted quickly in two cities: Fremont, CA and Chicago • Tests had to be done quickly as information was needed by 3rd party app developers • Also needed to be secretly so that the competition was not aware before the iPad was launched. • 7 participants with 3+ months experience with iPhones • Signed an informed consent form explaining: – what the participant would be asked to do; – the length of time needed for the study; – the compensation that would be offered for participating; – participants’ right to withdraw from the study at any time; – a promise that the person’s identity would not be disclosed; and – an agreement that the data collected would be confidential and would be available to only the evaluators • Then they were asked to explore the iPad • Next they were asked to perform randomly assigned specified tasks www.id-book.com 8 Examples of the tasks used in the iPad evaluation www.id-book.com 9 Adapted from Budiu and Nielsen, 2010 Source: http://www.nngroup.com/reports/ipad-app-and-website-usability. Used courtesy of the Neilsen-Norman Group Problems and actions • Examples of problems detected: – Accessing the Web was difficult – Lack of affordance and feedback – Getting lost in an application – Knowing where to tap • Actions by evaluators: – Reported to developers – Made available to public on nngroup.com • Accessibility for all users important • Study did not address how iPad would be used in people’s everyday lives • Another study was done a year later to examine this and other issues that there was insufficient time to address in the first study www.id-book.com 10 Usability testing conditions • Usability lab or other controlled space. • Emphasis on: – selecting representative users; – developing representative tasks. • 5-10 users typically selected. • Tasks usually around 30 minutes • Test conditions are the same for every participant. • Informed consent form explains procedures and deals with ethical issues. www.id-book.com 11 How many participants is enough for user testing? • The number is a practical issue. • Depends on: – schedule for testing; – availability of participants; – cost of running tests. • Typically 5-10 participants. • Some experts argue that testing should continue until no new insights are gained. www.id-book.com 12 Usability testing & Experiments • Usability testing is applied experimentation. • Developers check that the system is usable by the intended user population by collecting data about participants’ performance on prescribed tasks. • Experiments test hypotheses to discover new knowledge by investigating the relationship between two or more variables. www.id-book.com 13 Usability testing & research Usability testing • Improve products • Few participants • Results inform design • Usually not completely replicable • Conditions controlled as much as possible • Procedure planned • Results reported to developers Experiments for research • Discover knowledge • Many participants • Results validated statistically • Must be replicable • Strongly controlled conditions • Experimental design • Scientific report to scientific community www.id-book.com 14 Experiments • Test hypothesis • Predict the relationship between two or more variables. • Independent variable is manipulated by the researcher. • Dependent variable influenced by the independent variable. • Typical experimental designs have one or two independent variables. • Validated statistically & replicable. www.id-book.com 15 Experimental designs • Different participants (between subjects) - single group of participants is allocated randomly to the experimental conditions. • Same participants (within subjects) - all participants appear in both conditions. • Matched participants (pairwise) - participants are matched in pairs, e.g., based on expertise, gender, etc. www.id-book.com 16 Different, same, matched participant design Design Advantages Disadvantages Different No order effects Many subjects & individual differences a problem Same Few individuals, no individual differences Counter-balancing needed because of ordering effects Matched Same as different participants but individual differences reduced Cannot be sure of perfect matching on all differences www.id-book.com 17 Field studies • Field studies are done in natural settings. • “In the wild” is a term for prototypes being used freely in natural settings. • Aim to understand what users do naturally and how technology impacts them. • Field studies are used in product design to: – identify opportunities for new technology; – determine design requirements; – decide how best to introduce new technology; – evaluate technology in use. www.id-book.com 18 A field study of a pain-monitoring device • Monitoring patients’ pain is a known challenge for physicians • Goal of the study was to evaluate the use of a pain- monitoring device for use after ambulatory surgery • Painpad was a keypad device • It was usability tested extensively in the lab before being taken into two hospitals. • Aim was to understand how painpad was used in the natural environment and routines in two UK hospitals. • How pain-monitoring with painpad differed from www.id-book.com 19 Painpad www.id-book.com 20 A tangible device for inpatient self-logging of pain Source: Price et al., 2018. Reproduced with permission of ACM Publications Data collection & participants • Two studies in two hospitals involving 54 people • 13 males, 41 females • Privacy was a important concern • Hospital stay ranged from 1-7 days, mean and median age 64.6, 64.5 • Given painpad after surgery and prompted to report pain levels every two hours • Nurses also collected scores • All data entered into charts • Patients of one hospital were given a user-satisfaction survey when the left • Also rated painpad on a 1-5 Likert scale www.id-book.com 21 Data analysis & presentation • Three types of data were collected: – Satisfaction with painpad based on questionnaire responses, – Patients’ compliance with the two-hour routine, – How data collected from painpad compared with data collected by nurses. • Data showed: – Satisfaction with painpad 4.63 on Likert scale; – Patience compliance was mixed, some liked others disliked or didn’t notice the prompts; – Patients recorded more scores with Painpad than with the nurses www.id-book.com 22 Key points • Usability testing takes place in controlled usability labs or temporary labs. • Usability testing focuses on performance measures, eg. how long and how many errors are made when completing a set of predefined tasks. Indirect observation (video and keystroke logging), user satisfaction questionnaires and interviews are also collected. • Affordable, remote testing systems are more portable than usability labs. Many also contain mobile eye-tracking and other devices. • Experiments test a hypothesis by manipulating certain variables while keeping others constant. • The experimenter controls independent variable(s) in order to measure dependent variable(s). • Field studies are evaluation studies that are carried out in natural settings to discover how people interact with technology in the real world. • Field studies that involve the deployment of prototypes or technologies in natural settings may also be referred to as ‘in the wild’ studies. • Sometimes the findings of a field study are unexpected, especially for in the wild studies that explore how novel technologies are used by participants in their own homes, places of work, or outside. www.id-book.com 23","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
