User-centered approach is based on: – Early focus on users and tasks: directly studying cognitive, behavioral, anthropomorphic & attitudinal characteristics – Empirical measurement: users’ reactions and performance to scenarios, manuals, simulations & prototypes are observed, recorded and analysed – Iterative design: when problems are found in user testing, fix them and carry out more tests 8www.id-book.com Four basic activities of Interaction Design 1. Discovering requirements 2. Designing alternatives 3. Prototyping alternative designs 4. Evaluating product and its user experience throughout 9www.id-book.com A simple interaction design lifecycle model Exemplifies a user-centered design approach 10www.id-book.com Another lifecycle model: Google Design Sprints (Knapp et al, 2016) 11 Source: www.agilemarketing.net/google-design-sprints/ Used courtesy of Agile Marketing www.id-book.com Another lifecycle model: Research in the Wild (Rogers and Marshall, 2017) 12 A framework for research in the wild studies Source: Rogers and Marshall, 2017, p6. Used courtesy of Morgan & Claypool www.id-book.com Some practical issues • Who are the users? • What are the users’ needs? • How to generate alternative designs • How to choose among alternatives • How to integrate interaction design activities with other lifecycle models 13www.id-book.com Who are the users/stakeholders? • Not obvious: – 382 distinct types of users for smartphone apps (Sha Zhao et al, 2016) – Many products are intended for use by large sections of the population, so user is “everybody” – More targeted products are associated with specific roles • Stakeholders – Larger than the group of direct users – Identifying stakeholders helps identify groups to include in interaction design activities 14 • Users rarely know what is possible • Instead: – Explore the problem space – Investigate who are the users – Investigate user activities to see what can be improved – Try out ideas with potential users • Focus on peoples’ goals, usability and user experience goals rather than expect stakeholders to articulate requirements 15www.id-book.com What are the users’ needs?How to generate alternatives • Humans tend to stick with something that works • Considering alternatives helps identify better designs • Where do alternative designs come from? – ‘Flair and creativity’: research and synthesis – Cross-fertilisation of ideas from different perspectives – Users can generate different designs – Product evolution based on changing use – Seek inspiration: similar products and domain, or different products and domain • Balancing constraints and trade-offs 16www.id-book.com How to choose among alternatives • Interaction design focuses on externally visible and measurable behaviour • Technical feasibility • Evaluation with users or with peers – Prototypes not static documentation because behaviour is key • A/B Testing – Online method to inform choice between alternatives – Nontrivial to set appropriate metrics and choose user group sets • Quality thresholds: – Different stakeholder groups have different quality thresholds – Usability and user experience goals lead to relevant criteria 17www.id-book.com How to integrate interaction design activities within other models • Integrating interaction design activities in lifecycle models from other disciplines needs careful planning • Software development lifecycle models are prominent • Integrating with agile software development is promising because – it incorporates tight iterations – it champions early and regular feedback – it handles emergent requirements – it aims to strike a balance between flexibility and structure 18www.id-book.com Some key points • Four basic activities in interaction design process – Discovering requirements – Designing alternatives – Prototyping – Evaluating • User-centered design rests on three principles – Early focus on users and tasks – Empirical measurement using quantifiable & measurable usability criteria – Iterative design 19www.id-book.com","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
