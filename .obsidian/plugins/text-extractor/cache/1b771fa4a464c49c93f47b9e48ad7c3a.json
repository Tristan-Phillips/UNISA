Of these engineers, 17 are well versed in the secret of a formal method (FM), 9 can use the Unified Modelling Language (UML), and 9 are familiar with the use of entity-relationship (ER) diagrams. If 5 engineers can use both an FM and UML, 4 both an FM ER diagrams, and 7 both UML and ER diagrams, answer the following questions: (a) How many engineers can use all 3 techniques, namely an FM, UML and ER diagrams? 2 (b) How many engineers can use UML only?
