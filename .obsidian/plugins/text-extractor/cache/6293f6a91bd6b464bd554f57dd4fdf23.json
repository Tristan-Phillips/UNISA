Please note the following: - The exam is taking place on myExams in the same exam site as the first exam. The exam will open 15 minutes earlier than the given time. Two sessions of 1 hour each must be completed within the period 11h45 to 14h45. You will only have one attempt per session - The exam is not compulsory. It was authorized due to the fact that a lot of students could either not get into myExams, or into the online assessment tab during the exam. No student will be stopped to do the re-take should they wish to, but if you are confident that you passed the exam, do not do the re-take as we do not want unnecessary load on the system. If you have any questions regarding this, please contact me on 011-6709109 - We have been informed that the system is stable. Should you get questions of which images do not display, please take a screenshot or picture, and send it to me after you have completed the exam, so that my inbox is reserved for other problems. You will get the mark for such questions if you can provide me with proof. - The best mark between the exam and the re-take exam will be used Regards William.
