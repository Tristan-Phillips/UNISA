Vision To be the Premier Source for Education, Workforce Training, Partnerships and Economic Development. GENERAL OPERATING ENVIROMENT We're here for you. Our job is to make sure your college experience is everything it should be exciting, stimulating, and successful. We're here for the community. Richland Community College's mission is to make quality education affordable and accessible to everyone in the Richland district. That's why Richland offers a variety of educational programs at low costs to students. We guarantee an equal education opportunity without regard to gender, marital status, colour, race, religion, national origin, or disability. To keep working for you, we need to know what you want. While at Richland, you may be asked for your input and opinions on such things as your favourite television or radio stations, how to make the schedules more user friendly, and other College issues. Through course evaluations, student forums, student government, and student/faculty conferences, we keep the lines of communication open. The organization is currently using paper based filing systems to keep track of their activities and assets. When they are purchasing college inventories they use Purchase Orders, When the deliveries arrive, they used the order or requisition form to mark the items that have been delivered at that moment and upon finishing the document is then filed so that it can be retrieved later when the need arise. When they rent the tools/equipment Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material they use request forms to track their use. Communications within the departments is done through use of paper memorandums Customers book for machine via the telephone or visit the site themselves Advertisement for new students’ enrolment is done through telephone and registration is done on desk by clerk. Files for students are kept in big room monitored by a senior member, if students request for information clerk needs to go through all the files to look for specified documents. ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE DEFINING PROBLEMS AND CONSTRAINS At Richland Community College the current system is mainly using paper based filling system. When performing accounting of all the transactions took place within a specified period, accountant has to go through all paper work (in files) meaning more time and errors when this activity is taking place. Marketing department use phone calls on making follow ups on their old students and as well when advertising for new enrolment , so sometimes there will be failure of network and some customers are lazy to do this resulting in company’s decrease in income revenue for the college. Management use manual evaluation of all the files (data) resulting in having ineffective decision making The ERP system developed eliminates the filing system at Richland Community College . Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material At Richland Community College there are 6 departments of these entire department each is standing on its own there’s no proper way of communications within these departments, memos are send in mail tray hence sometimes the communication is in effective. PROJECT OBJECTIVES  To design and implement database system that effectively stores and retrieves information for students and human resources.  To eliminate paper based filling systems Management on student’s documents.  To design a system that effectively allows students to communicate and enroll online.  To design a database system that allows the dean and other management authority to effectively manage the campus remotely.  To design an interactive Enterprise Resource Planning system for effective communication within all the college departments. PROJECT SCOPE AND BOUNDERIES PERMISSION The developed system to meet the business requirements of the college by allowing students to create their own accounts whenever the need arises , allows the management of documents centrally and allows human resources to communicate using E- mails on the system. The design of Richland Community College system may have the need for a fire wall between data moving in and out of the environment. This may add the need for user exits or other components integrated with the data propagation software. The developed system must meet the desired performance for all its users and the user interfaces to be user friendly for all the users . The developed system to be used the agile method of system development in a way to reduce cost by prototyping. The boundaries identify where the system to be sized starts and ends. The sizing should include everything for which the team is responsible. Items or areas that will be excluded should be clearly stated. The interface components that provide the standard interface would be in scope, but the supplier interfaces may be excluded. The component is assumed to be already implemented. For example, if the system will use standard reusable components, such as standard date routines or file access routines that will not be modified, then these may be excluded from the scope while the new interfaces to these routines may be in scope.

They also have control over all of the aspects of the company. Managers have five basics functions. Those functions are planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling by doing so they have helped me a lot when I was collecting data within their organization Policy makers – The role of the policy maker is act as a funnel to gather information through consultation and to reduce and extract from the information, a policy or a set of policies which serve to promote what is the preferred course of action and creation of business rules Department managers – they have direct control over a specified department .The accounting department manager helped me a lot with an insight of information within that department When I was going through my data collection I was given written documentation which includes: Procedures, Standards and Operations manuals which helped me a lot in my data collection Lastly I carried out direct interviews with end users INFORMATION COLLECTED AND PROCESSED During data collection I used different methods to collect required information. Questionnaires (Appendix A) Questionnaires usually used when need to quickly and/or easily get lots of information from people in a non- threatening way. It is likely to have correct information because the respondent can complete anonymously .also looking on the side of administrator it was inexpensive also allows the researcher to easily compare and analyze information gathered also allows to administer questionnaires to many people however this approach has its own draw backs this includes that we might not get careful feedback also wording can bias client’s responses and are impersonal and in surveys, may need sampling expert.

CM: Good Afternoon US: As we briefly discussed on the phone, I am a final year student at University of South Africa and would like to design a database for your company as part of my assignment for the module INF3703 Data Principles II CM: Absolutely, it will be a great opportunity for me to have an in-depth knowledge about database. It will help me if I resolve to digitalise system in future. US: Certainly Sir, Could I pose few questions? CM: Please proceed. US: Very well Sir, what system are you currently using for payroll and administration, procurement and accounting? CM: Parcon is currently using paper-based filling system ordering, invoicing tracking inventory, hiring site meetings. When purchasing new equipment and plant, we use purchase orders, when the deliveries arrive, we use order or requisition form to mark the items that have been delivered. The company also make use of an external accountant who does the financial statements, tax returns and payroll. US: What about communication between different departments within the company CM: Communication is done through the use of paper memorandums at different sites, and some top management have access to company phones and laptops. Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material US: Will you consider replacing your current system. Please give reason to your choice CM: Definitely, it is one of our top objectives for 2020 to adapt a paperless system. As our company continue to grow the amount of paperwork and documents also arise. Many of these files exists in storage taking up space and require plenty of time to locate specific documents. A paperless system will allow manager, supervisor, engineers administrative staff to be more efficient by locating and retrieving critical documents faster. Above all digitalisation is transforming the way industry functions and unleash global opportunity for value creation. US: In your company what business rules do you follow...What are the dependencies? CM: General managers, Operational managers and Admin manager report to me. All the department manager manages their subordinates. Main decisions are approved by me. US: What business rule, you may consider very paramount in your organisation? CM: Certainly, all payments and requisition are approved by the CEO US: How large do you expect the data to get? CM: Our company is new in the market, but we are expanding therefore we need to be proactive, a database that can hold about 100 000 different files. US: What internal control do you need reflected in the database. CM: Will need my employees to be able to enter all the information about vendors, clients, inventory, plant and equipment. The system will need to be able to make necessary calculations, print and create reports. US: Will you need to migrate your existing data to new system? CM: Definitely. US: Will you need a separate data warehouse for reporting? CM: Yes, that would be very helpful Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material US: Sir thank you for your time. CM: You are welcome PROPOSED BUSSINESS RULES Upon conducting several interviews with the CEO, general managers, department managers, operations department, drivers, end users and going through many different documents I proposed the following business rules.  A student cannot have more than two accounts.  Departments are responsible for receiving the appropriate approvals for any special hardware upgrades or requests, and transferring the necessary funds to ITS.  Shared computers used in administrative areas are eligible for a standard Windows desktop.  General manger manages accounts department, marketing department and engineering department  Students must check for account effectiveness online before commencing for classes  all human resource for the college must have a tax number  Students to view for college news and results online if they have paid all there fees. DATABASE APPROACH I am going to choose centralized database design approach. A centralized database consists of a single data server into which all data are stored and from which all data are retrieved. All the data reside at a single location and all applications must retrieve all data from that location. The centralized approach consists of a central server into which all forecast data are stored. At some predefined time, software on this central server requests data from each of the local data servers scattered throughout the country. These data are received, processed and stored, possibly at lower spatial and temporal resolution than the data from which it was derived. Reasons why we choose centralized database are as follow:  Decreased Risk: With Centralized data management, all edits and manipulation to core data are housed and stored centrally. This model allows for staunch controls, detailed audit trails, and enables business users to access consistent data.  Data Consistency: When data feeds are managed in a central repository, an organization can achieve consistent data management and distribution throughout its global offices and internal systems  Data Quality: A data-centric approach enables the establishment of a data standard across an enterprise, allowing organizations to make better business assessments. Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material  Operational Efficiency: When one business unit controls an organization data centrally, the resources previously devoted to data management can be redirected back to core business needs.  Single Point of Entry: By introducing single point of entry for data, this allows changes from data vendors to be implemented once, rather than in multiple instances.  Cost Saving: With data management centralized, costs attributed to vendor relationships are better controlled, minimizing any redundancy in market data contracts and their associated costs.  We choose this approach because the database we are designing is small and does not have many entities, attributes, relations and transactions. CONCEPTUAL DATABASE DESIGN Main Entities  Dean  College Administrator  College Board Committee  College superintendent  Coordination and Follow Up  Information Technology and Services Unit  Life Science Unit  Central Analytical and Applied Research Unit  Biology Department  Chemistry Department  Computer Science Department  Earth Science Department PRIMARY AND FOREIGN KEYS  EMPLOYEMNT_ID PK, FK  ACCOUNT_ID PK  Admin_ID PK  Stud_ID PK  Dept_ID PK Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material ER DIAGRAMS LOGICAL DATABASE DESIGN xxxx RELATIONAL MODEL Step 1 Create relations for strong entities Transform all regular entities in the ER diagram into relations. Each attribute in the entity becomes an attribute in the relation. For example machinery entity Create relations for stronger entities. Transform all regular entities in the ER diagram into relations. Each attribute in the entity becomes an attribute in the relation. For example, plant entity Employees(Employees ID{PK},Employees_Rank, Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Employees_Admin,SubContra_TaxNum{FK}) Contractor (Contractor_ID{PK}, Contractor_TaxNum,Contractor_Region,Invoice_BatchNum{FK}) Invoice(Invoice_ID{PK}, Invoive_Num, Invoive_BatchNum,Contarctor_Region{FK}) Checking and validating the integrity constraints on each relation.  domain constraints  entity integrity  Review the complete logical model with the user  Reviewing the completed logical model with the users to ensure that all the data requirements have been modelled.  Ensure that all the transactions are supported within the different user views.  This stage is very important as any problems need to be solved before beginning the physical database design stage.

The company also receives on average 120 enquiries a week from customers asking if certain tools or machinery available for rental. DEFINE AND EXPLAINED TRANSACTIONS Any action that reads from and/or writes to a database may consist of:  Simple SELECT statement to generate list of table contents.  Series of related UPDATE statements to change values of attributes in various tables  Series of INSERT statements to add rows to one or more tables  Combination of SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT statements Transaction is logical unit of work that must be either entirely completed or aborted. Concurrency Control in database management it is the coordination of simultaneous transaction execution in amultiprocessing database system and ensures serializability of transactions in a multiuser database environment. However simultaneous execution of transactions over shared database can create several data integrity consistency problems, like:  Lost updates  Uncommitted data  Inconsistent retrievals POSSIBLE SQL STATEMENTS FOR THE DATABASE ALTER TABLE ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype; ALTER TABLE lets you add columns to a table in a database AND SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material WHERE column_1 = value_1 AND column_2 = value_2; AND is an operator that combines two conditions. Both conditions must be true for the row to be included in the result set. AS SELECT column_name AS 'Alias' FROM table_name; AS, is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an alias. AVG() SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name; AVG() is an aggregate function that returns the average value for a numeric column. BETWEEN SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value_1 AND value_2; The BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set within a certain range. The values can be numbers, text or dates CASE SELECT column_name, CASE WHEN condition THEN 'Result_1' WHEN condition THEN 'Result_2' ELSE 'Result_3' Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material END FROM table_name CASE statements are used to create different outputs (usually in the SELECT statement). It is SQL's way of handling if-then logic. COUNT() SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name; COUNT() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of rows where the column is not NULL. CREATE TABLE CREATE TABLE table_name ( column_1 datatype, column_2 datatype, column_3 datatype ); CREATE TABLE creates a new table in the database. It allows you to specify the name of the table and the name of each column in the table. DELETE DELETE FROM table_name WHERE some_column = some_value; DELETE statements are used to remove rows from a table. OUTER JOIN SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_1 LEFT JOIN table_2 ON table_1.column_name = table_2.column_name; An outer join will combine rows from different tables even if the join condition is not met. Every row in the left table is returned in the result set, and if the join condition is not met, then NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table. WHERE Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value; WHERE is a clause that indicates you want to filter the result set to include only rows where the following condition is true. DIFFERENT DATABASE PERFOMANCE TUNING METHODS OR CONCEPTS Goal of database performance is to execute queries as fast as possible. Database performance tuning is Set of activities and procedures designed to reduce response time of database system. All factors must be checked to ensure that each one operates at its optimum level and has sufficient resources to minimize occurrence of bottlenecks Good database performance starts with good database design Database performance tuning activities c ‐tuning activities can be divided into: an be divided into: Client side Objective is to generate SQL query that returns correct answer in least amount of time, using minimum amount of resources at server end. Database performance‐tuning activities can be divided into:tuning activities can be divided into Server side DBMS environment must be properly configured to respond to client’s requests in fastest way possible, while making optimum use of existing resources. DBMS performance tuning SQL Performance Tuning Evaluated from client perspective. Most current generation relational DBMSs perform automatic query optimization at the server end. Most SQL performance optimization techniques are DBMS specific and are rarely portable. PRESENT THE DATABASE PERFOMANCE TUNING APPROACH USED AND REASONS Tuning is driven by identifying the most significant bottleneck and making the appropriate changes to reduce or eliminate the effect of that bottleneck. Usually, tuning is performed reactively, either while the system is in preproduction or after it is live. BOTTLENECK ELIMINATION PERFOMANCE TUNING APPROACH Tuning usually implies fixing a performance problem. However, tuning should be part of the life cycle of an application through the analysis, design, coding, production and maintenance stages. Often, the tuning phase is Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material left until the database is in production. At this time, tuning becomes a reactive process, where the most important bottleneck is identified and fixed. Usually, the purpose for tuning is to reduce resource consumption or to reduce the elapsed time for an operation to complete. Either way, the goal is to improve the effective use of a particular resource. In general, performance problems are caused by the overuse of a particular resource. The overusedresource is the bottleneck in the system. Remember that the different forms of contention are symptoms that can be fixed by making changes in the following places:  Changes in the application, or the way the application is used  Changes in Oracle  Changes in the host hardware configuration Often, the most effective way of resolving a bottleneck is to change the application. QUESTION AND ANSWERS CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED AND SOLUTIONS Growing complexity in landscape As the database market evolves, many companies are finding it difficult to evaluate and choose a solution. There are relational databases, columnar databases, object-oriented databases, and NoSQL databases. Not to mention the plethora of vendors offering their own spin on each. Limits on scalability The fact is all software has scalability and resource usage limitations, including database servers. Forward thinking companies concerned about transaction processing capacity know that cataloguing components, database architecture, and even operating systems and hardware configuration all affect scalability For the issue of security and learning the researcher was not allowed to take the deep consideration of the existing system. Increasing data volumes As the amount of data generated and collected explodes, companies are struggling to keep up. Research shows that we’ve created more data in the past two years than in the entirety of the human race. Yet, a 10% increase in data accessibility could generate more than R65 million additional net income for a typical Fortune 1000 company. Data security Databases are the hidden workhorses of many companies’ IT systems, storing critical public and private data. Lately there has been an understandable and high-profile focus on data security. A data breach typically costs a company $4 million, not to mention loss of reputation and goodwill This is how I handled the problems Establish decision criteria. The first step is to create an objective standard by which to Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material Downloaded by: t-promotional | t-promotional@pm.me Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.com - The Marketplace to Buy and Sell your Study Material evaluate your options. Of course each company will have different criteria. Some important considerations include cost of ownership, ease of use, functionality, ease of database administration, and scalability. Perhaps most important for businesses with long range projects, will the solution be around in 10 years. Match the solution to your business goals. Your choice of database technology should take into account your business goals. How much data are you collecting? How fast do you collect it? How will you access and analyze it? Each business is different, thus there is no one-size-fit-all answer here. Does it work with your existing technology? Of course you want to avoid ending up with sprawling systems and disparate platforms. So an important consideration is whether your solution will “play nice” with existing software and hardware components. Workload on hardware resources. Whatever DBMS you select will be judged on database performance, or how fast it supplies information to users. It is important to remember that workload can fluctuate dramatically by the day, hour or even minute. Take for example, the database during maximum. Under those conditions, the processing demands placed on the system may tax the hardware and software tools at the disposal of the system. The goal should be enabling the largest possible workload to be processed without resource upgrades. HOW YOU THINK THE ASSIGNMENT CAN BE IMPROVED For the betterment of the assignment time and resources must be taken into consideration.
