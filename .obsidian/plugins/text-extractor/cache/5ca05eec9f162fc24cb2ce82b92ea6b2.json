BARCODE 2 ASSIGNMENT 2 (Covers all the prescribed chapters, apply what you studied to answer the questions) Total score = 80 (100%) Question 1 (10 marks) What is the importance of involving users during the design of a computer information system? (10 marks). Answer (2 marks for nay five points) • Improved quality of the system arising from a more accurate capture of user requirements, this is because they use the system every day or on daily basis. • To avoid incorporation of costly system features that users would not want to use or cannot use. • To provide users with a system that meets their real expectations. • To ensure that users do not encounter surprises when the new system is delivered. • Greater understanding of the system by the users results in more effective use. Users can see from early stages of software development what the capabilities of the system are. • If users are involved, they will have chance to work with the product before it is released and they will have a better understanding of what to expect on the new system. • Increased participation in decision making within software development cycle increases ownership of the system by the users. Users who were involved feel that they have contributed to a product’s development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership. Question 2 (20 marks) Assume that you are involved in developing a new mobile phone e-learning site for a high school mathematics course. Suggest ways of applying the user-centered principles in this task. (20 marks) Principle 1: Early focus on users and tasks (8 marks) Allocate 3 marks for explaining the principle in the context desiging a mobile e-learning site  Understand the high school students by directly studying their cognitive, behavioural, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics. In this case we know that our users are going to be high school students.  The syllabus and outcomes have to be studied, and subject matter experts consulted, and it should be determined how technology can be used to improve the learning experience. This requires observing high school students doing their normal tasks, studying the nature of those tasks, and then involving the students in the design process. Allocate 5 marks for applying the principle in the context of designing a mobile phone e-learning site under the following sub principles  User tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development - Technology should not be the driving force  User’s behavior and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them.  User’s characteristics are captured and designed for.  Users are consulted throughout the development from the earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account.  All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment. Principle 2: Empirical measurement (6 marks) INF3720/102 3 6 marks for applying the principle in the context of designing a mobile phone e-learning site. Without contextualizing students lose marks At the beginning of the project, identify and document the targeted usability and user experience goals. This enables the mobile phone e-learning site to be empirically evaluated at regular stages as it is developed. The insights gathered from these measurements can guide the designers to choose between alternative designs. Iterative design (6 marks) 6 marks for applying the principle in the context of designing a mobile phone e-learning site. Without contextualizing students lose marks Feedback is essential to the iterative design process. Iteration is required because designers never get the solution right the first time. When problems are found in user testing, they are fixed and then more tests and observations are carried out to see the effects of the fixes. This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of design-test-measure-redesign being repeated as often as necessary. Question 3 (30 marks) This question takes you through the complete software development lifecycle for an interactive product. You are required to design and evaluate an interactive product for booking tickets online for a cinema. A user is supposed to be able to book a venue for watching a movie. Most cinema venues have an online booking facility already but it can be awkward and frustrating to identify and book the seats you want. In order for you to successfully answer this question, study the model answer provided under additional resources (Assignment 02 – Question 03.pdf). Do not copy the model answer, your answer should be unique. 3.1 Identify users’ needs (requirements) for the online facility. To identify user needs, you should collect data from the users. Record your data in point form. (5 marks) The form of data gathering students use, will depend on circumstances that they encounter. There are plenty of people to talk to about how they obtain tickets for an event and gather their requirements needs. Hence, students are expected to provide a variety of answers to this question. Allocate 1 mark per requirement need identified by a student. 3.2 Based on the user requirements, choose a user profile and produce one persona and one scenario for each, capturing how the user is expected to interact with the product. (5 marks) Students are expected to provide a user profile and produce one persona, then describe a scenario in detail, capturing how the user is expected to interact with a system, for example, a ticket booking system. The persona and scenario described by the students should be different from the one given below. Any student who provide a persona and a scenario that shows evidence of copying the one given below, penalise the student. Allocate 5 marks For example (Students should not duplicate this scenario, they should come up with their own scenerios) One user profile is a male student aged 17 who is partially deaf. A scenario for this user might be. \"Dan enjoys taking part in virtual chat environments. Late one night, he is in conversation with someone who recommends that he go and see the latest James Bond movie that has just come out. It's too late to phone the local cinema to see if it's on there, so he decides to use the internet to obtain some tickets for the following weekend. At the cinema website he looks for the film titles currently showing. The structure of the site is quite clear, and it's possible to go straight to the information about films and showing times. The James Bond movie is indeed showing. From this page, he can indicate the time of his choice and order the tickets. He chooses the 7pm performance, but the system tells him that this is fully-booked and offers him alternatives: the 5.30pm and the 8pm showings both have available seats. The system displays the seating plan for the cinema which shows the available seats for each showing, and how much each costs. Dan then chooses the seats and 4 showing time that he wants, confirms the booking, and pays for it. As he is partially deaf, he needs to double- check that the cinema is equipped with suitable sound amplification technology that links in to his hearing aid. Having completed his order, he returns to chatting with his friends.\" 3.3 Perform a task analysis on the main tasks associated with the ticket booking system, i.e booking a ticket. (10 marks) Allocate 2 marks per task identified by a student for any five tasks. Answer The tasks Dan was involved with were: 1. Finding if the film was on at the cinema 2. Finding out the times of the showing 3. Choosing the showing 4. Choosing the seat 5. Confirming the booking 6. Paying for the booking 7. Checking for other facilities at the cinema Note that this is not a complete HTA, but is a starting point. 3.4 Using the data gathered in 3.1 and your subsequent analysis, identify different kinds of requirements for the product under the following headings: environmental, user and usability. (10 marks) Answer Some basic considerations and example requirements from this scenario are given below. Your scenarios may be very different, and will hence yield very different requirements: Environmental (the answer should take into consideration physical, social, organisational, technical) (4 Marks) The user might be in a variety of physical settings, and at different times of day, e.g. at home, in the street, in the rain, etc. In our scenario Dan was probably sitting at a desktop computer but he could have been using a cell phone. User (3 marks) There are potentially many different kinds of user. You must decide who your website is targeted for: children under 18? only adults with a credit card? What about visually impaired users, or the elderly who may have difficulties controlling their movement? Usability (3 marks) The website should be usable the first time, without any training. This is an expression of the Volere requirement for the functional requirement. Question 4 (20 marks) Go to myUnisa under Additional resources and download the file “Case study – Academic library. pdf”. Read the case study and answer the following questions. Answer 4.1 What was the purpose of the usability evaluation? (1 mark)  To determine whether or not the library’ users could effectively use the web site to perform specific tasks.  To determine how effective the library website worked when used for library research by undergraduates with little or no experience using the website. INF3720/102 5 4.2 Which challenges were encountered in carrying the usability testing of the website? (4 marks)  A range of heterogeneous library participants (users) to choose from  Setting the questions fr usability testing  privacy of the testing room, to allow participants to comfortably talk aloud  some of the participants were not punctual on appointment time and some did not pitch up  participants had varying learning abilities and technical proficiency  difficulties in interpreting the results due to subjective nature of variables such as aesthetics and idiosyncrasies  presenting tasks to users in a way that the testers would learn the participants’ responses and actions  designing unambiguous and specific questions that evaluate the usability of the site’s functionalities rather than the technical skills of the participants.  Multiple links of the website confused participants when navigating from one page to the other. 4.3 List the main tasks or activities performed by the participants during the usability testing of the website. ( 5 marks) Some students identified groups of tasks as:  Using the site to identify an item/title that is part of the Libraries’ collections;  Using the site to locate the most appropriate resource for finding journal articles on a specific topic; and  Using the site to find an appropriate starting point for researching a topic without necessarily knowing the format or sources of information. But, some students identified groups of tasks as:  Online Resources (links to electronic information products to which the Library subscribes);  UB Libraries Catalog (links to the online public access catalog);  Web Search (links to various aids for identifying information on the site and on the Internet);  Need Help (links to guides for starting research). The activities were:  Do the University Libraries own the book Alias Grace?  Is the journal Northeast Anthropology available in the UB Libraries?  Can you find a journal article on gospel music?  How would you find a journal article on soap operas?  I am interested in investing in what are referred to as “callable securities.” Where can I find recent articles about them? (You need to see the full article.)  Use the database SocioFile to look for an article about nursing homes and mental illness. What would you have to do to obtain this article?  How would you go about finding the author of this quotation: “And we meet, with champagne and a chicken, at last?”  Assume you are taking a class in a subject you know very little about, for example, psychology, literature, environmental science, architecture or film. If you were assigned a research paper, how would you find information resources on that subject?  Find an encyclopedia article about French wine.  Obtain background information about the “ethnic cleansing” that has taken place in Kosovo.  Does the Libraries’ Web site have a guide to doing research in computer science? 6 4.4 Which data collection methods were used to collect data? (5 marks)  think aloud  direct observation of users being tested  a written log of events that took place during testing  a record of user movements during navigation  post evaluation user satisfaction questionnaire  post evaluation report by the tester 4.5 List any five issues discovered by the usability testing. (5 marks)  the “Web Search” and “Need Help” links failed the “easy to learn” measure  participants confused by the meaning of, “Online Resources” and “Library Catalogues” , which resulted in failing to satisfy the “causes few errors” measure  the process of connecting to the catalog through the “Web-interface link” was unnecessarily unpleasant.  “Online Resources” page was difficult to decipher  Users did not find the “Online Resources” page easy to use when searching an article from a named database. Participants could not identify the database titles.  On finding articles on general topics, the ‘Online Resources” page failed the entire usability test because the participants could not identify the “Quick Start” link.  The participants could not identify “reference Resources” as a logical link to begin exploration of a topic.
