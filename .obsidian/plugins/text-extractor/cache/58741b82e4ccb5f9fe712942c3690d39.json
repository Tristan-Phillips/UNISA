HauskrechtCS 441 Discrete mathematics for CS Cartesian product (review) Let A={a1, a2, ..ak} and B={b1,b2,..bm}. The Cartesian product A x B is defined by a set of pairs {(a1 b1), (a1, b2), … (a1, bm), …, (ak,bm)}. Cartesian product defines a product set, or a set of all ordered arrangements of elements in sets in the Cartesian product. 2 M. HauskrechtCS 441 Discrete mathematics for CS Binary relation Definition: Let A and B be two sets. A binary relation from A to B is a subset of a Cartesian product A x B. •Let R A x B means R is a set of ordered pairs of the form (a,b) where a A and b B. • We use the notation a R b to denote (a,b) R and a R b to denote (a,b) R. If a R b, we say a is related to b by R. Example: Let A={a,b,c} and B={1,2,3}. • Is R={(a,1),(b,2),(c,2)} a relation from A to B? Yes. • Is Q={(1,a),(2,b)} a relation from A to B? No. • Is P={(a,a),(b,c),(b,a)} a relation from A to A? Yes M. HauskrechtCS 441 Discrete mathematics for CS Representing binary relations • We can graphically represent a binary relation R as follows: •if a R b then draw an arrow from a to b. a  b Example: • Let A = {0, 1, 2}, B = {u,v} and R = { (0,u), (0,v), (1,v), (2,u) } •Note: R A x B. • Graph: 2 0 1 u v 3 M. HauskrechtCS 441 Discrete mathematics for CS Representing binary relations • We can represent a binary relation R by a table showing (marking) the ordered pairs of R. Example: • Let A = {0, 1, 2}, B = {u,v} and R = { (0,u), (0,v), (1,v), (2,u) } • Table:R | u v 0 | x x 1 | x 2 | x R | u v 0 | 1 1 1 | 0 1 2 | 1 0 or M. HauskrechtCS 441 Discrete mathematics for CS Relations and functions • Relations represent one to many relationships between elements in A and B. • Example: • What is the difference between a relation and a function from A to B? a b 1 2 3 4 M. HauskrechtCS 441 Discrete mathematics for CS Relations and functions • Relations represent one to many relationships between elements in A and B. • Example: • What is the difference between a relation and a function from A to B? A function defined on sets A,B A  B assigns to each element in the domain set A exactly one element from B. So it is a special relation. a b 1 2 3 a b 1 2 3 M. HauskrechtCS 441 Discrete mathematics for CS Relation on the set Definition: A relation on the set A is a relation from A to itself.

HauskrechtCS 441 Discrete mathematics for CS Binary relations • Theorem: The number of binary relations on a set A, where | A | = n is: • Proof: • If | A | = n then the cardinality of the Cartesian product | A x A | = n2. • R is a binary relation on A if R A x A (that is, R is a subset of A x A). • The number of subsets of a set with k elements : • The number of subsets of A x A is : 2 2 n . 2 22 || nAxA  k2 6 M.
