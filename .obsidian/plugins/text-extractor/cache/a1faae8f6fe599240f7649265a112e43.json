Agent Characterization • Meant to be a tool for analyzing systems – not characterizing them as agent versus non-agent • Lots of things can be characterized as agents (artifacts) that act on the worldagents (artifacts) that act on the world • AI operates where – Artifacts have significant computational resources – Task Environments require nontrivial decision making CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 5 Vacuum Cleaner World AB CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 6 • Percepts: which square (A or B); dirt? • Actions: move right, move left, suck, do nothing • Agent function: maps percept sequence into actions • Agent program: function’s implementation • How should the program act? 2 Rational Agent – does the right thing What does that mean? One that behaves as well as possible given the Environment in which it acts. How should success be measured? On consequences. • Performance measure CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 7 • Performance measure – Embodies criterion for success • Amount of dirt cleaned? • Cleaned floors? – Generally defined in terms of desired effect on environment (not on actions of agent) – Defining measure not always easy! Rationality Depends on: 1. Performance measure that defines criterion for success. 2. Agent’s prior knowledge of the environment. 3. Actions the agent can perform. 4 Agent’s percept sequence to date CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 8 4. Agent s percept sequence to date. For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.

(are other CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 13 drivers best described as maximizing a performance element?) – Multi-agent means other agents may be competitive or cooperative and may require communication – Multi-agent may need communication Properties of Task Environments (affect appropriate agent design) • Deterministic vs Stochastic – Deterministic – next state completely determined by current state and action Uncertainty may arise because of defective CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 14 – Uncertainty may arise because of defective actions or partially observable state (i.e., agent might not see everything that affects the outcome of an action). Properties of Task Environments (affect appropriate agent design) • Episodic vs Sequential – Episodic the agent’s experience divided into atomic episodes Nt id t d d t ti t k CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 15 – Next episode not dependent on actions taken in previous episode. E.g., assembly line – Sequential – current action may affect future actions. E.g., playing chess, taxi – short-term actions have long-term effects – must think ahead in choosing an action Properties of Task Environments (affect appropriate agent design) • Static vs Dynamic – does environment change while agent is deliberating? St ti dl CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 16 – Static – crossword puzzle – Dynamic – taxi driver Properties of Task Environments (affect appropriate agent design) • Discrete vs Continuous. Can refer to – the state of the environment (chess has finite CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 17 ( number of discrete states) – the way time is handled (taxi driving continuous – speed and location of taxi sweep through range of continuous values) – percepts and actions (taxi driving continuous – steering angles) Properties of Task Environments (affect appropriate agent design) • Known vs Unknown - This does not refer to the environment itself, but rather the agent’s knowledge of it and how it changes CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 18 it changes. - If unknown, the agent may need to learn 4 Properties of Task Environments (affect appropriate agent design) • Easy: Fully observable, Deterministic, Episodic, Static, Discrete, Single agent.

Possible Agent Program CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 22 Agent Programs • Need to develop agents – programs that take the current percept as input from the sensors and return an action to the actuators CISC4/681 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 23 actuators. • The key challenge for AI is to find out how to write programs that, to the extent possible, produce rational behavior from a small amount of code.

Learning Element – responsible for making improvements (on what ever aspect is being learned…) 2. Performance Element – responsible for selecting external actions. In previous parts, this was the entire agent!this was the entire agent! 3. Critic – gives feedback on how agent is going and determines how performance element should be modified to do better in the future 4. Problem Generator – suggests actions for new and informative experiences.
