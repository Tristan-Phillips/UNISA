The earth is round and either the moon is cold, or a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth comes in between the sun and the moon Question 1.2 Question 1.3 To show that a sequent is not valid, we must find a valuation in which the formulas on the left-hand side are true, but in which the formula on the right-hand side is false. p q r 𝒑 → 𝒒 𝒒 → (𝒑 ∧ 𝒓) p 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 The sequent is not valid because on line 1 the premises are true and conclusion is false Question 1.4 i. Mark every T (𝑞 ∧ 𝑟 → 𝑠) ∧ (𝑞 ∧ 𝑟 → 𝑇) ∧ (𝑠 ∧ 𝑞 →⊥) ∧ (𝑞 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) Nothing more can be marked and ⊥ hasn’t been marked, so the original Horn formular is “Satisfiable” Question 2 Question 2.1 i. For all x, if x is a student in class then either x has visited Canada or x has visited Europe All students in this class have visited Canada or Europe ii. ∃𝑥(𝑆(𝑥) ∧ 𝐶(𝑥)) Question 2.2 i. Wff ii. Wff iii. Not wff – conjunction operator is binary should have two augments iv. Not wff – conjunction operator is binary should have two arguments v. Not wff - Q must have the correct number of arguments Qustion 2.3 Question 2.4 Question 3 Question 3.1 a. Determine whether it holds i. 𝒙𝟏 ⊩ □□(𝒑 ∧ 𝒒) • □□(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) holds vacuously in x1 (because there are no worlds accessible from x1), ii. 𝒙𝟐 ⊩ □𝒒 → □𝒑 • Does not Hold: q is true in all worlds accessible form x2 namely x1 and x3, therefore □𝒒 , but p is not true in all worlds accessible from x2 namely x3. So □𝒑 is false, Since the antecedent is true and the consequent are false in x2 □𝒒 → □𝒑 is false in x2 iii. 𝑥3 ⊩◊ 𝑝 ∧◊ q • Hold: p and q is trues I a word accessible from x3 namely x1, so ◊ 𝑝 and ◊ q holds for x3 iv. 𝑥3 ⊩◊ (¬𝑝 ∧ q) • Does not hold: ¬𝑝 does not hold for any world accessible from x3, so ◊(¬p ∧q) does not hold b. Find a Kripke model The modal logic does not hold for the Kripke model x1: because p is not true in all worlds accessible from x1, therefore □𝒑 is false x2: because q is not true in all worlds accessible from x1, therefore □𝒒 is false Question 3.2 i. Not Valid - if the agent does not believe that p then is it not possible that he does not believe p ii. Rewrite as □𝒑 → ¬□¬𝒑 • If the agent believes that p, then he believes that not p is not not p Question 3.3 i. If it is possible that I could go to the party then I got permission from my dad Question 3.4 i. Agent K1 knows that ¬𝑝 or Agent K2 does not know p ii.
