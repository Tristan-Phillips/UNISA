What are the services do you expect from your FitnessPal App? b) Semi structured interview interviewer follows a basic guideline and follows up answers Semi structured interview allows Fitnesspal App candidates to get freedom to express their views and provides most reliable data. It may be difficult to interpret a respondent’s body language OR: to react appropriately without bias What do you think about healthy diet? c) Focus group Interviewing people in small groups using a representative sample Allows diverse and sensitive issues to be raised that might otherwise be missed; OR: suitable for investing community issues Some group members with dominant and extroverted personalities tend to dominate the conversation as a result some people struggle to stay engaged in Focus group Can you tell us about your experience when using the FitnessPal App? d) Observation Users are observed by the researchers through records of their activities or as they perform their activities. Data collected for the Fitnesspal App was very reliable and accurate Observing involves a lot of time as one must wait for an event to happen to study that event. Who is using The Fitnesspal App? e) Questionnaire is a research instrument that Can be analysed more There is no way to tell how How would you rate our FitnessPal App? Question 2 Briefly discuss the concepts of persona, scenario and use case. Develop a persona and scenario for the new version of the Eat4Health app to improve the usability and user experience of the app. Also compile an essential use case for one functionality of the new version of the Eat4Health app (e.g. to keep track of the balance of your diet’s carbohydrates, protein, and fat, and to make recommendations on improving your dietary habits). A scenario defines when, where and how the story of a persona (main character who the story is about) takes place. In this case, the persona is the Tennis player who wants to monitor the fitness indicators during workout session such as his average heartbeat, the duration of the workout and/ or the total number of calories/kilojoules burned. A use case focuses on the user-system interaction rather than the user’s task itself. The scenario above is rendered in more technical terms as follows: The Tennis Player starts a workout session on his/her fitness tracker, which then activates automatic tracking on FitnessApp. The athlete selects the type of exercise (e.g. running) and FitnesApp should track the speed, number of steps and average heart rate and store it in the database. After the workout, FitnessApp should combine the various exercises into one session and show the detailed and summarised data on the app on a user’s phone. consists of a set of questions or other types of prompts that aims to collect information from the respondent? 'scientifically' and objectively than other forms of research truthful a respondent is being. Question 3:1 Briefly discuss the three types of evaluation and mention one argument or consideration for and against each type. Three types of evaluation • Controlled settings involving users – examples of these include laboratories and living labs - users' activities are controlled to test hypotheses and measure or observe certain behaviours. The main methods are usability testing and experiments. • Natural settings involving users – examples of these include online communities and public places - there is little or no control of users' activities in order to determine how the product would be used in the real world. The main method is the use of field studies. • Any settings not involving users - consultants and researchers’ critique, predict, and model aspects of the interface to identify the most obvious usability problems. The range of methods includes inspections, heuristics, walkthroughs, models, and analytics. Question 3.2 When a prototype of the new version of the Eat4Health app becomes available, you will have to do a usability testing of it before it is released to the public. You have decided to do a field study of the pilot version “in-the-wild”. Provide some guidelines with examples that can be used to facilitate such an evaluation process for the prototype of the new version of the Eat4Health app. a) Field studies are done in natural settings. The FitnessPal App adjusts its brightness using my preferred setting and the level of light; however, I still must adjust it manually sometimes and this can be annoying. b) Studies in natural settings can be messy; activities can overlap or be interrupted. I have evaluated my phone’s interface by making calls, texting, and browsing at home, at the office and in a restaurant. I have found that advertisements pop-ups can be very annoying and cause me to send replies to the wrong recipients, especially if I am interrupted by other inputs c) Field studies can range in time (minutes to years). My evaluation was done in the first week after I upgraded my phone, but it can be repeated after a few months to compare my experience of the interface. d) Field studies can be used to study appropriation of technologies. I have found that I prefer to use apps that speak to local circumstances. e) Since I have evaluated my own phone, issues of ensuring privacy and telling people about their rights were not relevant, but these are important if other people are involved in the field test, e.g. participants should be informed that they have a right to withdraw at any time. Question 4:1 Plan the study by discussing relevant aspects in terms of possible methods, the selection of participants and the tasks that will be required of them. Refer to the relevant theoretical principals and apply them to the Eat4Health app a) Usability testing in a controlled setting reduces outside influences and distractions. FitnessApp – this will allow me to observe certain behaviours b) Other data collection methods can be used, such as interviews and questionnaires I will confirm my observations and analysis using structured interviews with a second group of trainers and the gym manager who should also be using FitnessApp themselves c) Users are required to perform typical tasks to test whether the system does what it is supposed to – I will ask users to do interval training of running, elliptical and biking while evaluating how efficient the FitnessApp tracker/system tracks these exercises d) Users’ reactions to the interactive product can reveal usability issues that could be missed in other experiments and reports– I will ask a team of trainers to observe the athletes’ body language and to ask to follow up questions when they express joy or frustration while using FitnessApp e) When there is more than one way to conduct a certain task, participants could be asked to perform all of these to evaluate which one is the best or the fastest. I will ask the athletes to use three various kinds of stationary bikes to measure FitnessApp’s accuracy for the various types to adjust the algorithm where necessary. Question 4:2 Explain to the CEO what you would need in terms of labs and equipment to do the testing, and motivate your needs with reference to the Eat4Health app. To do the testing of for the Eat4Health App will need custom-built usability labs that consist of a main testing lab with recording equipment and an observation room where the designers can watch what is going on and how the data collected is being analysed. Recruit and screen participants Find willing participants What are the behaviours or approximate personas you are looking for Hook ‘me Give them the pitch Screen for fit to user profile A camera recorded the participant’s interactions and gestures when using the iPad and streamed the recording to a laptop computer. A webcam was also used to record the expressions on the participants’ faces and their think-aloud commentary. The laptop ran software called Morae, which synchronized these two data streams. observers (including the moderator sitting next to the participant) watched the video streams (rather than observing the participants directly) on their laptops situated on the table so that they did not invade the participants’ personal space. Question 4:3 What aspects will be covered on the informed consent form to be signed by each participant? Give an example of each aspect with reference to the current version of the Eat4Health app. This form described the following: • What the participant would be asked to do (e.g. comment on what they like and disliked about the app) • The length of time needed for the study (e.g. Keep sessions short and within the promised amount of time (i.e. if you say it will take 15 minutes, make sure it does) Stay on script as it will ensure some rigor and consistency to the study. • The compensation that would be offered for participating in the study • The participants’ right to withdraw from the study at any time • A promise that the person’s identity would not be disclosed • An agreement that the data collected from each participant would be confidential and would not be made available to marketers or anyone other than the researchers Question 5 Heuristics Problems related to the Eat4Health app Examples where the Eat4Health app does it right 1.Visibility of the system status The App does not have a glowing LED / flashing element indicating that the interface is live. The app makes a swoosh sound when recording training session or adding the recipe. 2. Match between the system and the real world The App has tendency to use programming language and syntax on the display, this will certainly be a mismatch to a user. There are set rules for the format of user password, that allow the user to type rather than waiting for the user to click submit. 3.User control and freedom The App does not check with the user if they tapped “cancel” by mistake Undo and Redo buttons are available in the toolbar, and can also be accessed with the standard keyboard shortcuts 4.Consistency and Standards While the device has a stopwatch option, the app does not provide the same functionality. A submit button in one page look the same across the device and cell phone app 5.Error Prevention The App does not confirm with the user if she wants to pause monitoring a training session - this may lead to incorrect stats the user pushes the hard button by accident. The App has constraints that does not allow a user to set wrong value(e.g.) When you expect a number, it does not allow to write the letters. 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall The icons on the app do not make clear which measures are done automatically (e.g. heartrate) and which ones should be manually recorded (e.g. weight). The App lets you pick the topics of interest from a list of options rather than asking you to type all of them which would have been disastrous. 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use Users cannot modify any frequently used actions on the Fitbit device. A user can either use the auto-tracking function or use the manual start and stop option on the device. 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design The notification screen on the device is very small and not suitable to read long emails. The information on the main screen of the device is minimalistic, showing only time, date, steps and heartbeat. It is easy to check time and date quickly (although shaking your arm gets annoying very fast). 9. Help and Documentation The help functions on the app. does not include a list of There is a search field, there are main categories and FAQs video tutorials, customer forums. . frequently asked queries on the same page. 10. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors Incorrectly recorded recipes and training sessions cannot be deleted or corrected. If the User enter a fictitious username and password, they will get an error message to say either username or password is incorrect","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
