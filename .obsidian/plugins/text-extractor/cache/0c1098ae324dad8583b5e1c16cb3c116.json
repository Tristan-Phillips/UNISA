Setting goals • Decide how to analyze data once collected 2. Identifying participants • Decide who to gather data from • How many participants are needed 3. Relationship with participants • Clear and professional • Informed consent when appropriate 4. Triangulation • Look at data from more than one perspective • Collect more than one type of data, eg qualitative from experiments and qualitative from interviews 5. Pilot studies • Small trial of main study www.id-book.com 3 Data recording • Notes, audio, video, photographs can be used individually or in combination: – Notes plus photographs – Audio plus photographs – Video • Different challenges and advantages with each type of data recording www.id-book.com 4 Interviews • Unstructured - are not directed by a script. Rich but not replicable. • Structured - are tightly scripted, often like a questionnaire. Replicable but may lack richness. • Semi-structured - guided by a script but interesting issues can be explored in more depth. Can provide a good balance between richness and replicability. • Focus groups – a group interview www.id-book.com 5 Interview questions • Two types: − ‘closed questions’ have a predetermined answer format, e.g.. ‘yes’ or ‘no’ − ‘open questions’ do not have a predetermined format • Closed questions are easier to analyze • Avoid: − Long questions − Compound sentences - split them into two − Jargon and language that the interviewee may not understand − Leading questions that make assumptions e.g.. why do you like …? − Unconscious biases e.g.. gender stereotypes www.id-book.com 6 Running the interview • Introduction – introduce yourself, explain the goals of the interview, reassure about the ethical issues, ask to record, present the informed consent form. • Warm-up – make first questions easy and non-threatening. • Main body – present questions in a logical order • A cool-off period – include a few easy questions to defuse tension at the end • Closure – thank interviewee, signal the end, eg. switch recorder off. www.id-book.com 7 Other forms of interviews www.id-book.com New 8 Digital conferencing systems such as skype, zoom, email and phones can be used to conduct interviews. Some advantages are: • Participants are in their own environment so are more relaxed • Participants don’t need to travel • Participants don’t need to worry about what to wear • For interviews involving sensitive issues it is easier for interviewees to be anonymous Enriching the interview process • Props - devices for prompting interviewee, e.g. use a prototype, scenario www.id-book.com 9 Questionnaires • Questions can be closed or open • Closed questions are easier to analyze, and may be distributed and analyzed by computer • They can be administered to large populations • Disseminated by paper, email and the web • Sampling can be a problem when the size of a population is unknown as is common online evaluation www.id-book.com 10 Questionnaire design • The impact of a question can be influenced by question order. • You may need different versions of the questionnaire for different populations. • Provide clear instructions on how to complete the questionnaire. • Strike a balance between using white space and keeping the questionnaire compact. • Avoid very long questions and questionnaires • Decide on whether phrases will all be positive, all negative or mixed. www.id-book.com 11 Question and response format • ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ checkboxes • Checkboxes that offer many options • Rating scales – Likert scales – semantic scales – 3, 5, 7 or more points • Open-ended responses www.id-book.com 12 Encouraging a good response • Make sure purpose of study is clear • Promise anonymity • Ensure questionnaire is well designed • Offer a short version for those who do not have time to complete a long questionnaire • If mailed, include a stamped addressed envelope • Follow-up with emails, phone calls, letters • Provide an incentive • 40% response rate is good, 20% is often acceptable www.id-book.com 13 Advantages of online questionnaires • Relatively easy and quick to distribute • Responses are usually received quickly • No copying and postage costs • Data can be collected in database for analysis • Time required for data analysis is reduced • Errors can be corrected easily www.id-book.com 14 Example of an online questionnaire www.id-book.com 15 Showing check boxes, radio boxes and pull down menus Problems with online questionnaires • Sampling is problematic if population size is unknown • Preventing individuals from responding more than once can be a problem • Individuals have also been known to change questions in email questionnaires www.id-book.com 16 Deploying online questionnaires • Plan the timeline • Design offline • Program/complete online template • Test the survey to make sure it behaves as you expect • Test it with a group that will not be part of the survey to check that the questions are clear • Recruit participants www.id-book.com 17 Observation • Direct observation in the field – Structuring frameworks – Degree of participation (insider or outsider) – Ethnography • Direct observation in controlled environments • Indirect observation: tracking users’ activities – Diaries – Interaction logging – Video and photographs collected remotely by drones or other equipment www.id-book.com 18 Observation www.id-book.com 19 Figure 8.8 Mars Exploration Rover Source: Reproduced by permission of NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA-JPL). Structuring frameworks to guide observation • Three easy-to-remember parts: – The person: Who? – The place: Where? – The thing: What? • A more detailed framework (Robson, 2014): – Space: What is the physical space like and how is it laid out? – Actors: What are the names and relevant details of the people involved? – Activities: What are the actors doing and why? – Objects: What physical objects are present, such as furniture – Acts: What are specifi c individual actions? – Events: Is what you observe part of a special event? – Time: What is the sequence of events? – Goals: What are the actors trying to accomplish? – Feelings: What is the mood of the group and of individuals? www.id-book.com 20 Planning and conducting observation in the field • Decide on how involved you will be: passive observer to active participant • How to gain acceptance • How to handle sensitive topics, eg. culture, private spaces, etc. • How to collect the data: – What data to collect – What equipment to use – When to stop observing www.id-book.com 21 Ethnography (1) • Ethnography is a philosophy with a set of techniques that include participant observation and interviews • Debate about differences between participant observation and ethnography • Ethnographers immerse themselves in the culture that they study • A researcher’s degree of participation can vary • Analyzing video and data logs can be time-consuming • Collections of comments, incidents, and artifacts are made www.id-book.com Ethnography (2) • Co-operation of people being observed is required • Informants are useful • Data analysis is continuous • Interpretivist technique • Questions get refined as understanding grows • Reports usually contain examples www.id-book.com 23 Ethnography (2) www.id-book.com 24 Figure 8.9 (a) The situation before MERboard; (b) a scientist using MERboard to present information Source: J. Trimble, R. Wales and R. Gossweiler (2002): “NASA position paper for the CSCW 2002 workshop on Public, Community and Situated Displays MERBoard. Online Ethnography • Virtual, Online, Netnography • Online and offline activity • Interaction online differs from face-to-face • Virtual worlds have a persistence that physical worlds do not have • Ethical considerations and presentation of results are different www.id-book.com 25 Observations and materials that might be collected (Crabtree, 2003) • Activity or job descriptions. • Rules and procedures that govern particular activities. • Descriptions of activities observed. • Recordings of the talk taking place between parties. • Informal interviews with participants explaining the detail of observed activities. • Diagrams of the physical layout, including the position of artifacts. • Other information collected when observing activities: – Photographs of artifacts (documents, diagrams, forms, computers, etc.) – Videos of artifacts. – Descriptions of artifacts. – Workflow diagrams showing the sequential order of tasks. – Process maps showing connections between activities. www.id-book.com 26 Direct observation in a controlled environment • Direct observation – Think aloud techniques • Indirect observation – tracking users’ activities – Diaries – Interaction logs – Web analytics • Video, audio, photos, notes are used to capture data in both types of observations www.id-book.com 27 Choosing and combining techniques • Depends on the: – Focus of the study – Participants involved – Nature of the technique(s) – Resources available – Time available www.id-book.com 28 Summary • Data gathering sessions should have clear goals. • An informed consent may be needed. • Five key issues of data gathering are: goals, choosing participants, triangulation, participant relationship, pilot. • Data may be recorded using handwritten notes, audio or video recording, a camera, or any combination of these. • Interviews may be structured, semi-structured or unstructured • Focus groups are group interviews • Questionnaires may be on paper, online or telephone • Observation may be direct or indirect, in the field or in controlled settings. • Techniques can be combined depending on the study focus, participants, nature of technique, available resources and time. www.id-book.com 29","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
