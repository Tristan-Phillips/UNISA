Question 1.4 Algorithm to be applied: 1. Mark all T. 2. Mark sequents if operands are marked (all occurrences, repeat). 3. If a contradiction (⊥) is marked, it is unsatisfiable. 4. If a contradiction (⊥) is not marked, it is satisfiable. Marking is shown by underlining the item. Question: (𝑞 ∧ 𝑟 → 𝑠) ∧ (𝑞 ∧ 𝑟 → T) ∧ (𝑠 ∧ 𝑞 →⊥) Step 1: (𝑞 ∧ 𝑟 → 𝑠) ∧ (𝑞 ∧ 𝑟 → T) ∧ (𝑠 ∧ 𝑞 →⊥) Step 2: Nothing more can be marked. Step 4: No contradiction is marked, so the formula is satisfiable.

If this substitution had to take place 𝑔(𝑥) would be captured by ∃𝑥 in the right-hand side of the tree. Question 2.4 i) ⊢ ∀𝑥(𝑃(𝑥) → 𝑄(𝑥)) → (∃𝑥 𝑃(𝑥) → ∃𝑥𝑄(𝑥)) 1 ∀𝑥(𝑃(𝑥) → 𝑄(𝑥)) assumption 2 𝑥0 𝑃(𝑥0) → 𝑄(𝑥0) assumption [𝑥0/𝑥] 3 𝑃(𝑥0) assumption 4 𝑄(𝑥0) → 𝑒 2, 3 5 ∃𝑥(𝑃(𝑥)) ∃𝑥 𝑖 3 6 ∃𝑥(𝑄(𝑥)) ∃𝑥 𝑖 4 7 ∃𝑥(𝑃(𝑥)) → ∃𝑥(𝑄(𝑥)) → 𝑖 5,6 8 ∃𝑥(𝑃(𝑥)) → ∃𝑥(𝑄(𝑥)) ∃𝑥 𝑒 2, 3 − 7 9 ∀𝑥(𝑃(𝑥) → 𝑄(𝑥)) → ∃𝑥(𝑃(𝑥)) → ∃𝑥(𝑄(𝑥)) → 𝑖 1, 8 ii) ∀𝑦¬𝑃(𝑦) ⊢ ¬∃𝑥𝑃(𝑥) There is not valid proof for the above sequent as it is not valid. To prove this, 𝑦0 would need to leave its scope as 𝑥. See page 116 where a similar example is shown not to be valid and on page 117 they remark that it is not possible to prove this using the predicate natural deduction rules. There may have been a typo in the question. OR: ∀𝑦¬𝑃(𝑦) ⊢ ¬∃𝑥𝑃(𝑥) 1 ∀𝑦¬𝑃(𝑦) premise 2 𝑦0 [𝑦0/𝑦] 3 𝑃(𝑦0) assumption 4 ∀𝑦𝑃(𝑦) ∀𝑦𝑖 3 5 ⊥ ¬𝑒 1,4 6 ¬𝑃(𝑦0) ¬𝑖 3 − 5 7 ¬∃𝑥𝑃(𝑥) ∃𝑥𝑖 2 − 6 See “Solutions to selected exercises_cos3761.pdf” example 9(r). They do not switch variables in that example, however. At the bottom of page 111, they do show that it is possible to switch variables in proofs. Not sure if it has been done correctly. iii) ∀𝑥(𝑃(𝑥) → 𝑄(𝑥)), ∀𝑥(𝑃(𝑥)) ⊢ ∀𝑥𝑄(𝑥) 1 ∀𝑥(𝑃(𝑥) → 𝑄(𝑥)) premise Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides Downloaded by: TTEQ | tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides 2 ∀𝑥(𝑃(𝑥)) premise 3 𝑥0 𝑃(𝑥0) → 𝑄(𝑥0) ∀𝑒1 4 𝑃(𝑥0) ∀𝑒2 5 𝑄(𝑥0) → 𝑒3,4 6 ∀𝑥(𝑄(𝑥)) ∀𝑥𝑖 3 − 5 See page 111, where the exact same example is given. Question 3 Question 3.1 a) (i) 𝑥1 ⊩ □□(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) This holds in the model as there are no worlds accessible from 𝑥1, which makes □(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) vacuously holds. See the bottom of page 311. (ii) 𝑥2 ⊩ □𝑞 → □𝑝 This states that in all the worlds accessible from 𝑥2, where there is a 𝑞, there is also a 𝑝. This is not the case in world 𝑥2 which evaluates to true for □𝑞 and false for □𝑝. This relation does not hold. (iii) 𝑥3 ⊩◊ 𝑞 ∧◊ 𝑝 This relation holds in the world as 𝑥1 is accessible from 𝑥3 so some world is accessible that has both 𝑝 and 𝑞. (iv) 𝑥3 ⊩◊ (¬𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) This looks for a single world accessible from 𝑥3 that does not have a 𝑝, but does have a 𝑞. 𝑥1 is the only world accessible from 𝑥3 and it contains 𝑝 so this relation does not hold. b) The relation line does not have arrows to show the relationship is bidirectional. The above world does not satisfy the formula because all worlds accessible from both 𝑥1 and 𝑥2 contain 𝑝, but both worlds have worlds accessible to them, but do not contain 𝑞.

The agent 𝑝 does not know, but agent 𝑝 also knows that agent 𝑝 does not know. See page 319. (ii) It is valid as if agent 𝑝 believes it, then it is also consistent with agent 𝑝’s beliefs. See page 318, which lists this as holding. Question 3.3 (i) It is possible that I go to the party, but I will need to get permission from my dad. *Assumed that they meant translate it into English. I may have missed something. (ii) I may not get permission from my dad, and I do not need to go to the party so this will not be frustrating.

QUESTION 3 [38] Question 3.1 Consider the following Kripke model with worlds a, b, c and d: q p, q p a c d p b Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides Downloaded by: TTEQ | tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides COS3761 Oct/Nov 2016 [TURN OVER] 8 (i) For each of the following relations, determine whether it holds in the above Kripke model and give reasons for your answer: 1. a ╟ ◊ ◊ p In order for ◊ ◊ p to be true in world a, ◊ p has to be true in at least one world accessible from a. The worlds that are accessible from a are a itself and b and d. In order for ◊ p to be true in any of these worlds, p has to be true in a world accessible from the relevant world. We see that p is true in such a world, for example in c which is accessible from world b. Thus the relation does hold. 2. b ╟ ◊ p  □ q In order for ◊ p  □ q to be true in world b, both ◊ p and □ q have to be true in world b. This means that p should be true in at least one world accessible form b and q should be true in all worlds accessible from b. The worlds that are accessible from b are a and c. Because q is not true in world a, the relation does not hold. 3. d ╟ q  p In order for q  p to be true in world d, p should be true or q should be false in the world. We see that that is the case, so the relation does hold. 4. c ╟ □ □ ¬ p In order for □ □ ¬ p to be true in world c, □ ¬ p has to be true in all worlds accessible from c. The only world accessible from c is world d. In order for □ ¬ p to be true in world d, ¬ p has to be true in all worlds accessible from d. The only world accessible from d is world b. We see that p is not true in world b, i.e. ¬ p is true there. Therefore the relation does hold. (ii) Write down any modal logic formula containing at least one modal connective which is not valid but is true in the above Kripke model. Explain your answer. (5) Solution: example: ◊ ¬ q  ◊ ◊ ¬ q The formula is true in world a because ¬ q is true in a world accessible from a, namely world a (and d). The formula is true in world b because ¬ q is true in a world accessible from b, namely world a. The formula is true in world c because ¬ q is true in a world accessible from c, namely world d. The formula is true in world d because ◊ ¬ q is true in a world accessible from d, namely world b (because ¬ q is true in a world accessible from b, namely world a.) The formula is not valid. It is, for example, not true in the model below because world b does not have any world accessible to it. a b p Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides Downloaded by: TTEQ | tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za Distribution of this document is illegal Stuvia.co.uk - The Marketplace for Revision Notes & Study Guides COS3761 Oct/Nov 2016 [TURN OVER] 9 Question 3.2 Suppose we want to re-engineer basic modal logic to fit the following reading of □ : □ : Always in the future For each of the following two formulas, state whether it should be valid or not and explain your answer in both cases. (i) □    Solution: If □ has the required meaning, the sentence □   means “If  is always true in the future, it is true (now)”. This sentence should not be valid, because even if  is true in future,  may still be false at present (ii) ◊ T Solution: Valid. It says that there is a future world in which T is true. (3) Question 3.3 Say we interpret the modal operators □ and ◊ to represent the notions \"necessarily true\" and \"possibly true\" respectively, and say we interpret the propositional letters p and q to mean \"I am intelligent\" and \"I will get a gold medal\" respectively. (i) Express the following modal logic formula in English: □ p  ◊ ¬ q (2) If it is necessarily true that I am intelligent then it is possibly true that I will not get a gold medal. (ii) Translate the following declarative sentence into modal logic: If it is necessarily true that I will get a gold medal, then I will get a gold medal. (3) □ q  q Question 3.4 (i) Express the following modal logic formula in English where Ki is read as “Agent i knows that”: K1 K2 ¬ p → q (2) If Agent 1 knows that agent 2 knows not p, then q.

RM: Interpret R(x, y) as “x > y”. The formula is true in this model, because if one integer is greater than another neither is greater than itself. Consider the following non-mathematical model N: As required, let the universe A of concrete values be {a, b, c}. RN = {(a, b), (a, c), (b, c), (b, a), (c, a), (c, b)} or any subset thereof. (RN must just not contain any ordered pairs of identical values.) The formula is true in this model, because without any ordered pairs of identical values, the consequent of the implication will always be true. (ii) Consider the following mathematical model M: Let the universe A of concrete values be the set of integers. RM: Interpret R(x, y) as “x = y”. The formula is false in this model because for every pair of integers x and y that make the antecedent true (i.e. x = y), will make the consequent will be false. Consider the following non-mathematical model N: As required, let the universe A of concrete values be {a, b, c}. RN: = {(a, a), (b, b), (c, c)} or any set that has a non-empty intersection with this set. (RN must therefore contain at least one ordered pair of identical values.) The formula is false in this model because any pair of values that are equal will make the antecedent true, but the consequent false. Question 3.1 (i) (a) Does not hold. For □ ◊ q to be true in world x1, ◊ q must be true in all worlds accessible from x1, namely x2 and x4. But ◊ q is not true in x2 because there is no world accessible from x2. (b) Holds. □ p holds vacuously in x2 (because there are no worlds accessible from x2), and ¬ p holds in x2. Since the antecedent and the consequent are true in x2, □ p → ¬ p is true in x2. (c) Holds. Since p is true in x3 and x3 is accessible from itself, ◊ p is true in x3, and so is ◊ ◊ p. (d) Holds. p  q is true in all worlds accessible from x4, namely x1 and x2 (because p is true in x1 and q is true in x2), so □ (p  q) is true in x4. (ii) Some possibilities are □ p  ◊ q or q  ◊ q. Any other non-valid formula that is true in all worlds, is acceptable. The student must explain why the formula is true in each world, i.e. in x1, x2, x3 and x4, and why it is not valid.

Induction hypothesis: Assume the integer k has the required property, thus 2k + 1 < 2k. Now we investigate the case where n = k+1, i.e. we investigate whether the integer k+1 also has this property. Thus we check whether 2(k + 1) + 1 < 2k+1: 2(k + 1) + 1 = 2k + 1 + 2 < 2 k + 2 because of the induction hypothesis < 2 ∙ 2k because k > 2 = 2 k+1 which is what we had to show. Since we successfully showed both the base case and the inductive step, we infer by mathematical induction that all integers greater than or equal to 3 have the property stated above.

For □ (¬p ∨ ¬ q) to be true in b, ¬p ∨ ¬q has to be true in all worlds accessible from b. The only world accessible from b is b itself and ¬p ∨ ¬q is false there. Thus the relation does not hold. QUESTION 8 □ ϕ → ϕ: should be valid. If the agent knows ϕ, it has to true.
