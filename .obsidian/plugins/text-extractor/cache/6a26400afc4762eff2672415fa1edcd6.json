Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) is a private tutoring company in South Africa that provides tutoring services to students who are enrolled for diplomas and degrees in Information Systems at various colleges and universities. In the past, ITS’s tutors have been using WhatsApp to communicate with their students, but the company has decided to consider other options due to concerns about WhatsApp’s new terms and conditions that will be implemented in 2021. ITS considers the following alternatives: • Developing its own Africanised messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients • Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localise the app for the South African market Assume that you have been appointed by ITS as an HCI expert. Management has tasked you to do a user experience evaluation of Telegram as a possible alternative. ITS decides to adopt Telegram and you have to manage all aspects of interaction design (ID) related to the possible future enhancements or alternatives planned for the South African market. Question 2.1 As an interaction designer, briefly describe interactive technologies that can be used to design the ITS app that is accessible and inclusive to meet the needs of the following group of users. Describe in point form the technologies per each group of users. (6 marks) Users Technology description (3 marks each) Blind users (persons that cannot see) - screen readers - option for an adjusted interface with no keyboard but instead large buttons for sending voice notes and speech-to-text functionality for sending texts - support for braille typing Deaf users (persons that cannot hear) - the app can take voice notes that have been sent and convert them to text live - auto captioning for video calls and videos played in-app - support for using phone flash as notification signal Question 2.2 There is a fine line between an interaction that works and that is usable. Designing interactions that work and are usable is achievable if design principles are appropriately applied. Discuss how you would apply the following principles when designing the ITS app. (15 marks) Principle Description (3 marks each) Visibility The more visible a function is, the easier it would be to find that function and know how to use it. This can be implemented by making the most used functions the most visible. An example of this would be opening the application in a window where the most recent chats are at the top of the list and another example is making the “send” button larger than the other buttons in a chat. Question 2 45 marks 5 INF3720 JUN/JULY [Turn over] Feedback This is about sending back information about actions that have been done and what has been accomplished. This can be done by allowing the user to easily view the status of his/her message. An example of doing this would be to use a system similar to the one used in WhatsApp where a single dot means sent, a doable dot means sent and a line means message read. Constraints This is about restricting the types of actions that users can take at under certain conditions. This can be done by not allowing users to send messages in certain chats that are there just to receive announcements from tutors. An example of this would be to stop the keyboard from popping up when those chats are opened and by removing the send button etc. Consistency This refers to using similar actions to perform similar tasks, as opposed to having similar tasks use wildly different actions to access them making the interface unintuitive and confusing. This can be done in one way by having the settings button in the same place all the time. An implementation of this would be to have the settings button on the top right of the main page to access the main settings and by having the chat settings on the top right of the chat page. Affordance This refers to attributes of objects that allow users to know how to use it just by looking at it. This can be done by making the send button obvious to use. An example of this would be by making the send button larger, a different colour and by adding a symbol (like a letter or arrow) on it that indicates its function. 6 INF3720 JUN/JULY [Turn over] Question 2.3 As an interaction designer for ITS, you would need to collect some requirements from the stakeholders. Identify four stakeholders and list them in the following table. (4 marks) Stakeholder (1 mark per stakeholder) 1 Developers 2 Project funders 3 Tutors 4 Students Question 2.4 What is the importance of involving users during the design of ITS? Identify at least 5 valid points and record them in the table below. (10 marks) Description of the point (2 marks per valid point) 1 Developers gain a good understanding of user requirements 2 Ensures that the final product is usable to the end users 3 Manages the users’ expectations of the product 4 Users are more likely to support the product because of feelings of ownership due to involvement 5 Ensures a more efficient development process where little backtracking due to useless ideas takes place Question 2.5 During the design of the ITS app, how would you manage the expectations and ownership of the product by the stakeholders? Provide your answer in point form in the table below. (10 marks) Point Description (2 marks per valid point) 1 Involve stakeholders in the design process 2 Adequate and timely training before the product is released 3 Clarify the expectations of the stakeholders so that everyone understands the requirements (use focus groups) 4 Provide regular updates throughout the development process 5 Host regular meetings with stakeholders to assess their satisfaction Question 3.1 What do you understand by the term \"emotional interaction\"? (2 marks) Emotional interaction is concerned with what makes people feel various emotions and using that information to design user experiences. Question 3.2 From the components of the Anthony Ortony et al. (2005) model of emotional design, briefly explain how a wristwatch designed for teenage girls will invoke each of the components of the model. Provide your answer in the following table. (9 marks) Question 3 19 marks 7 INF3720 JUN/JULY [Turn over] Component Explanation 1. Visceral This refers to making a product look, feel and sound good. This is done by using bright colours and wild designs. 2. Behavioural This refers to the usability of a product. This is achieved by its affordances of use and a system that is widely used by other watches. 3. Reflective This refers to the meaning and personal value of the product in a certain culture. This is achieved by using cultural imagery that reflect the environments that teenage girls regularly interact with. 3.3 You want to buy the above watch for your teenager. Assume that the watch has sports functions, including measuring heart rate and recording sport activities. You are concerned about the usability of the watch. List any four usability questions that you would ask before buying the watch in the following table? (8 marks) Usability questions 1. How clearly is the heart rate and sport information displayed? 2. How comfortable is the watch? 3. How accurate is the heart rate monitor? 4 How long does the battery last? Interviews can be viewed as a conversation with a purpose between two or more people where questions are asked by the interviewer to get facts or clarity from the interviewee. Interviews are mostly used for requirements gathering during product design or for testing the usability of a product. In point form, describe the characteristics of structured interviews and focus groups in the following table. (6 marks) Structured interview characteristics Focus group characteristics 1. Predetermined questions are asked, and all participants get the same questions in the same order. 1. Allows diverse and sensitive issues to be raised that could have otherwise been missed. 2. Typically closed questions are asked. 2. Usually a group led by a trained facilitator. 3. Only useful if the goals of the interview are clearly understood. 3. Participants are a representative sample of the target population. Question 4 6 marks 8 INF3720 JUN/JULY [Turn over] Cognitive walkthroughs involve simulating a user’s problem-solving process at each step in the human computer dialog, checking to see if the user’s goals and memory can be assumed to lead to the next correct action. In point form, describe each of the five steps involved in cognitive walkthroughs. (10 marks) Description of cognitive walkthrough stage 1. Characteristics of typical users identified and documented. Sample tasks for the design being evaluated are developed. A description, mock-up or prototype of the interface is produced with a sequence of actions needed for users to complete the task. 2. Designer and UX researchers come together to do the analysis. 3. UX researchers walk through the actions for each task and answer questions like, “are the correct actions obvious?” 4. Information including assumptions of possible problems, side issues and a summary are compiled. 5. Informed tests done on real users and problems are fixed.
