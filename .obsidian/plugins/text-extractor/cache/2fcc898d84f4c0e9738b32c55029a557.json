They are intended to help designers explain and improve their designs. They act like triggers to ensure that designers have provided certain features in an interface. They provide a framework for what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks. The provide the dos and don’ts of interaction. 1.2 List five design Principles that are concerned with how to determine what users should see and do when carrying their task when using an interactive product according to Preece et al (2015) (5 Marks) Affordance: Know how to use an object. Press on whatsapp, go the telephone to make a call. click, scroll. Scroll bars, icons, buttons, keypads have become part of our everyday affordances. Feedback: Visual, Audio, vibrotactile, tactile, verbal or combo. Typing on a whatsapp message Visibility: Visibilility of applications, You can see when whatsapp has new messages. Constraints: Login screens, size of a cell phone. Consistency: each cell phone works consistently. Typing a message via whatsapp or through SMS works the same. makes it easier to learn. 1.3 One of the main design principles for website design is simplicity. Nelsen propose that designers go through all their design elements and remove them ne by one. If a design works well without an element, then just remove it. Do you think this is a good design principle? Discuss. (5) I think it is a good design principle in order to learn what simplicity means. A website with too much content, too many graphics, too many colours can be very off-putting resulting in too much stimuli. However, a good designer might remove all the design elements as a learning experience. However, he will learn to find a balance between simplicity and a good overall design. A website with a plain vanilla background and loads of text is also not good. The goal here is to create a website that is crisp, clean, provides a good experience and where the user is able to easily find the information they want. 2 Question 2 2.1 Briefly explain each of the following terms as they usability, framework, conceptual model as they relate to human computer interaction. 2.1.1 Usability Refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective, enjoy able from the users’ perspective. Usability goals are : Memorability Utility Learnability Effective Effeciency Safety Page 2 of 6 2.1.2 Framework (pg54) A framework is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions - Frameworks tend to be prescriptive, providing designers with concepts, questions, and principles to consider 2.1.3 Conceptual Model(Pg41) A high level description of how a system is organised and operates. An abstraction of what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. 2.2 Discuss the core components of a conceptual model 2.2.1 Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity (e.g.browsing, bookmarking). 2.2.2 The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task–domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them (e.g. saving, revisiting, organizing). 2.2.3 The relationships between those concepts (e.g. whether one object contains another, the relative importance of actions to others, and whether an object is part of another). 2.2.4 The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (e.g. one can revisit through looking at a list of visited sites, most-frequently visited, or saved websites). 2.3 In which three ways can metaphors and analogies be applied to conceptual design 2.3.1 As a way of conceptualising what we are doing. 2.3.2 As a conceptual model instantiated at the interface 2.3.3 As a way of visualising an operation Not sure of this one. 3 Question 3 3.1 Explain what is meant by Persuasive Technology. Persuasive technologies are technologies designed to change people’s attitude or behaviour or both without using coercion or deception. The currently, the technologies include pop-ups, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, etc. Persuasive strategies include: Just in time persuasion, Simulating experience, Personalizing, Recommendation, Monitoring and tracking, Competition and recognition 3.2 Give any example of Persuasion Just in time persuasion. Amazon’s one click mechanism Recommendation. Other customers who bought this book also bought Personalizing. Receiving mail on other books with similar content on one which you’ve bought Monitoring and Tracking. Monitor sites you’ve been to and track you using cookies and provide you pop-ups, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages Page 3 of 6 o Simulating experience: There is an app that is called HIV roulette in which the user chooses people that they might interact with. You then spin the roulette wheel and the system informs you of the possibility of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. o Competition and recognition: Fitbits also use competition and recognition pursausion techniques to compete against friends and your personal best and recognises good behaviour. o Visualizing the personalities When systems put users into certain demographic groups and feed them advertising 3.3 Discuss how the design of technology can change the attitude and behaviour of people (18) Technology can be designed to change the attitude and behaviour of people. In one study in order to encourage people to take the stairs, the stairs were designed as a large piano. When People walked. After this adjust to the stairs, the amount of people taking the stairs increased. Technology can be designed to encourage positive behaviours in people or they can be used to entice, cajole or lure people into buying products. Designers use methods such as Just in time persuasion. For example, you were about to buy something on a website and then changed your mind. As you are about to exit the site, a pop up appears and offers you a discount. Simulating an experience for example the piano stairs is fun and interesting and would encourage people to take the stairs. Personalising. I think google does this very well albeit a bit creepy. They are trying to gain market share for products such as google sheets and google docs, as well as the use of their on line calendar. I personally have had reminders to pay accounts. Google read my mails, realised I had to pay an account and send a reminder on the day of payment. On my birthday, the google doodle changed to happy birthday and when I went closer, my first name appeared. Recommendation. Amazon had designed it web sites so that it keeps data on what other users have bought when they purchased the same item you did. That way they are able to recommed to you additional items that might correlate with what you are buying. Monitoring and tracking. Again with Amazon, they keep a record of genres and items you are more likely to buy and then they market products in that genre to you via your e mail address. Competition and recognition . With all the focus on the environment, there are apps that next to your taps that monitor your water consumption and have graphs so that each family member can track our much water they are using. This builds competition and encourages the desired behaviour. Feelings of guilt and achievement get used in order to achieve desired results. Fit bits and exercise gadgets also encourage exercise and healthy living. Many people buy them to check them out or as status symbol. There are others who use the full functionality of these devices. I know people who all own them and they have competitions to see who will have the most steps by the end of the week. Visualizing the personalities in virtual communities. Personalities in virtual communities also entice you to buy, like the little chat bots that pop up when you get to a sit. These can either encourage you to buy or annoy you. It depends are how well they are designed. Not sure Page 4 of 6 4 Question 4 Several e-readers for reading e-books, watching movies or viewing pictures are available on the market. The exact design differs between mo dels by they support book reading that is intended to be as comfortable as reading a paper book. The developers of a new e-reader want to find out how appealing it will be to young people under the age of 18 years of age. To this end, they have asked you to conduct some interviews for them. You are required to answer the following questions in preparation for the interview. 4.1 What is the goals of your data gathering session? Will the e-reader be appealing to young people under the age of 18. 4.2 List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the interview. Notes and Photographs Video Audio plus Photographs 4.3 What are the disadvantages of takes notes during the interviews The interviewer is so busy focusing on writing which makes it difficult to observe and therefore she might miss other visual communication Easy to lose concentration Biases creep in Speed of writing is limited Difficult and tiring to write Handwriting difficult to decipher 4.4 Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals. What would make an e-reader fun for you? What would annoy you about an e-reader? What would make you apprehensive to pick up an e-reader? How do you think we could make an e-reader cool to use? What would entice you to pick up an e-reader? What colours should the e-readers come in? What do you think would make the ereader pleasurable to use? 5 Question 5 When following a user-centred approach in interaction design there is a principle of focus on users and tasks early. This is one of the principles that make it easy and useful to use a computer system. 5.1 Name and explain five sub-principles that’s explain the meaning of the above statement 5.1.1 User goals and user tasks are the driving force behind development Technology will inform design decisions and options. It should not be the driving force. Always ask how will this technology better support user goals and not where we can employ a certain technology. Page 5 of 6 5.1.2 Users’ behaviour and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them Understanding behaviour highlights priorities, preferences and explicit intentions. They help designers understand users needs better. 5.1.3 Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for When we design products, we need to understand what the limitations of our users are. Humans makes mistakes. We need to be aware of the cognitive abilities, attention, memory and perceptions as well as physical aspects of our users in order to successfully design for them 5.1.4 Users’ are consulted from the earliest to the latest phases and their input is seriously taken into account There are different levels of user involvement and there are different ways to consult users. Involvement needs to be organised and designers need to respect the views of the user. 5.1.5 All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their environment, their work. This doesn’t mean that designers don’t design. It simply means that all design decisions are taken with the users best interests in mind. using personas is a way to achieve this. 5.2 How would you apply the five sub principles in improving the myUnisa system We would need to find out about the Unisa students goals and tasks, as well as their behaviours, context of use and characteristics. The goals and tasks for Unisa students range from making payments, uploading assignments, reregistering for a new semester. Downloading course material and finding out information about the site. Conduct interviews with students to establish if they have any additional goals or tasks that have not been catered for. Find out what frustrates them, what they enjoy about using the site Our users are students who vary greatly. They all have different cognitive and physical abilities. We need to take that into account when designing the site. We consult with other distance learning institutions and other universities to find other users and other contexts of use which have not been thought of. Our users need to be involved from the first phase right to the last phase. We will need to establish the level of involvement. The availability of our users and what involvement procedure we will define. Questionnaires, workshops, Focus groups and interviews can be applied to our users to help with each phase as well as evaluation to see if we are on the right track. We will create a white board with user requirements, context of work, their environments and use that as a reminder before we make any design decisions. Page 6 of 6 6 Question 6 Heuristic evaluation is an informal usability inspection technique developed by Nielson and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principals known as Heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure or on-line help conform to the principals. Discuss heuristic evaluation under the following headings 6.1 Briefly discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation 6.1.1 The briefing Session This is where the experts are told what to do, usually with a script as a guide so that each expert can receive the same briefing 6.1.2 The evaluation Period This is where the user typically spends between 1-2 hours independently inspecting a product, using the heuristics for guidance. Experts need to take at least two passes. The first pass gives a feel for the interface, the second pass allows the evaluator to focus on specific interface elements. The evaluator takes very specific notes to ensure that nothing is missed and that someone else reading the notes can understand. 6.1.3 The debriefing Session This is where the evaluators comes together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solutions. 6.2 Schneiderman’s eight golden rules are used as heuristics for identifying usability problems. Discuss the following three rules. 6.2.1 Cater for universal usability Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity. Novice to expert users. Users of different ages, races, genders, disabilities, technological ability. e.g. Features for novices and shortcuts for experts. 6.2.2 Offer informative feedback For every user action, there should be feedback. For frequent minor actions, the feedback can be modest. For infrequent, major actions, the feedback needs to be more substantial. 6.2.3 Permit easy reversal of actions As much as possible actions need to be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, builds confidence which encourages the user to explore more. Units of reversal include: a single action, a data-entry action or reversal of a complete group of actions.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
