COS3751 February/March 2022 Special Exam QUESTIONS 3 [TURN PAGE] × Searching for an X This question involves a problem-solving agent. The environment for this problem is a 1 n tiled strip. The tiles are all painted white on the side that is visible to the agent. Exactly one tile has an X painted on it. The situation is as shown in Figure 1. The agent starts in position (0) (the first tile in the strip) and must find which tile is marked with the X. ... 0 ... Figure 1: The tiled and labelled strip (a) Wh at kind of agent would be needed to solve this problem? Explain your answer. (3) (b) D efine a mathematical representation for the problem. This representation should be sufficient to store all of the information required to solve the problem. (2) (c) Sh ow the initial state using the representation given in b above? (2) (d) Sh ow the goal state using the representation given in b above? (2) (e) Determine an appropriate cost function for solving this problem. Justify your answer. (3) (f) Define the appropriate actions for this problem. Then using the successor function Result(a, S) 1→ St, show how applying each action a to some state S results in some state St. Note: for the purposes of this question you do not need to describe how the actions could be executed. (3) Question 1 Intelligent Agents [15] T – goal found Or a reasonable goal state based on their representation X COS3751 February/March 2022 Special Exam QUESTIONS 4 [TURN PAGE] Consider the following state graph, with path costs as indicated: Node A is the start node and node J the goal node in this state graph. (a) Perform a bi-directional search, using the breadth-first search algorithm to find the lowest cost path between the start node A and the goal node J. Show the expansion of nodes after each step. Use the lowest path cost to choose the first node to expand at each search step. Show every expansion of each of the two breadth-first searches. (10) (b) What is the cost of the lowest cost path (as found by your search)? (3) (c) Iterative deepening search combines the benefits of depth-first and breadth-first search. When is iterative deepening the preferred uninformed search method? (3) Question 2 Searching [16] COS3751 February/March 2022 Special Exam QUESTIONS 5 [TURN PAGE] A B C D E F G H I J K L 5 4 3 M N P Consider the game tree below and then answer the questions that follow. Note: the static utility values for the leaf nodes are provided below each leaf node. 6 4 6 (a) Suppose a Minimax search is performed on the tree. Provide the min-max values for nodes A, B, C, D, E and F . (3) (b) Suppose a Minimax search with Alpha/Beta pruning is done in a left-to-right fashion on the tree. Show how the search proceeds from the start (root) node. Your answer must proceed in a step-by-step fashion showing the v/α/β values for each node as the search pro- gresses (i.e. the v/α/β values as they propagate down the tree to child nodes), as well as which values are returned to the parent nodes. Also clearly indicate the tests for α/β cuts. Please note that you are only expected to trace the search on the left subtree of the given tree. (12) The first four lines of the solution are given to assist you in answering the question: 1. A: max – v = −∞, α = −∞, β = ∞ expand B 2. B: min – v = ∞, α = −∞, β = ∞, expand D 3. D: max – v = −∞, α = −∞, β = ∞ expand G 4. G: min – return utility value, ie return 5 Question 3 Adversarial Search [21] COS3751 February/March 2022 Special Exam QUESTIONS 6 [TURN PAGE] Solution: The textbook presents different heuristics along with backtracking search for solving these types of problems. The point here is for the students to give a description of how a general problem could be solved. I would do a brute force first pass – find out how many in each division, if the number for any division needs adjusting then find the lowest ranked players from the next division and move them down – repeat as necessary. When the numbers in the divisions are equal then use a backtracking approach to select players in each division and adjust the average handicap as necessary. (c) If the trace was continued on the right subtree of the given tree would the value of v at node A change? Explain your answer in detail. (6) A golf club decides to host a team tournament for all of its members. Their plan to have 4 teams of roughly equal strength. In practice this means having roughly the same number of high handicap players (C division), as medium handicap players (B division) and low handicap players (A division) in each team. Each player would be identified by their name and handicap. A division – Handicaps of 0 to 11 B division – Handicaps of 12 to 24 C division – Handicaps greater than 25. If the number of players in each division in each team is not the same then the remaining teams should be allocated the lowest handicapped players from the next division. For example, if team 4 has one B division player fewer than the other teams then it should be allocated the lowest handicapped C division player. An additional constraint is that average of the handicaps in each team in each division should be as close as possible to the same value. (a) Define the variables for this Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and explain why this definition makes sense. (2) (b) Define the domain for each variable in the CSP. (2) (c) Describe how one could go about solving any instance of this CSP. State any assumptions you make and explain any limitations of your solution. (6) (d) Demonstrate your approach on the instance of the problem given below.

In the initial state of the case the two leftmost cells are occupied by a Franc coin each, while two Pound coins occupy the two rightmost cells. The middle cell is empty. It can be illustrated as follows: The puzzle involves moving the coins one at a time to reach the goal state. In the goal state the Pound and Franc coins are interchanged, as follows: There are only four permissible moves: 1. A Pound Slide – a Pound coin slides one position to the left into an empty cell. 2. A Pound Hop – a Pound coin jumps left across one cell containing a coin into an empty cell. 3. A Franc Slide – a Franc coin slides one position to the right into an empty cell. 4. A Franc Hop – a Franc coin jumps right across one cell containing a coin into an empty cell. A cell may never contain more than one coin and all coins must be in the container after every move. (a) Design a state representation for the problem. (4) (b) Using your representation, define the start state, and the goal state. (3) (c) Explain why your representation adequately defines any state that could occur in the problem. (2) (d) Define the operators for this problem. (5) (e) How many possible states are there for this problem?

The corresponding entropy value is given by the table as 0.72. Always round the ratio to the nearest value on the table, for example: For E[2, 1], the ratio is p = 2 '.: 0.67 '.: 0.65, which makes the E[2, 1] = 0.93. © UNISA 2022 p E","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
