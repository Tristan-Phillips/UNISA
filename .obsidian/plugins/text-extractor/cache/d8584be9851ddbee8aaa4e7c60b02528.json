Eat4Health: study case for this assignment Assume that you are a specialist in human-computer interaction (HCI). You are employed by the developers of an app that keeps track of users’ eating habits and nutrition, how many calories they take in on a daily basis and how many they burn, as well as the balance between carbohydrates, protein and fat. You may use any diet app of your choice, e.g. cronometer (https://cronometer.com/), MyFitnessPal (the diet aspects, https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), Keto Manager (https://ketomanager.com/), etc. Please mention which app you have used for this assignment. For the sake of the questions below, the app will be called Eat4Health. When you give an example, criticism or recommendation regarding the app in your answers, you have to be specific to prove that you have done an in-depth review of the app’s functionalities and HCI/interaction design aspects. INF3720/102/02/2020 3 Question 1 Total: 20 marks 1.1 Discuss the definitions, similarities and differences between the concepts of interaction design and human-computer interaction, and give an example of each of these concepts in relation to Eat4Health. Use the table structure below for your answer. (10) Note: – unless indicated else, all direct quotes are from: Preece, J., Rogers, Y. and Sharp, H. 2019. Interaction design: Beyond human-computer interaction, 5 th edition. Indianapolis, IN: West Sussex. John Wiley & Sons. I have used the following real-life app for this assignment: MyFitnessPal (via Garmin Connect) [1] The app can be found at: Google Play Store [1] Interaction design (ID) Human-computer interaction(HCI) Definition [2] “Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives” / “[I]t is about creating user experiences that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate and interact” (Preece et al., 2019:9). Human-computer interaction (HCI) studies “the design and usability of computing systems” (Preece et al., 2019:10). Similarity [2] “Interaction Design (IxD) is the design of interactive products and services in which a designer's focus goes beyond the item in development to include the way users will interact with it. Thus, close scrutiny of users' needs, limitations and contexts, etc. empowers designers to customize output to suit precise demands\" (https://www.interaction- design.org/literature/topics/interaction- design). So, both ID and HCI study the interaction between software programs and its users/the interface of software applications for human users. “Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers. While initially concerned with computers, HCI has since expanded to cover almost all forms of information technology design” (https://www.interaction- design.org/literature/topics/human- computer-interaction). Difference [2] Interaction design is an overarching term/concept that describes the wider field of interface design and user experience (UX) (Preece et al., 2019:9). / “[I]nteraction design has a broader scope and includes Human computer interaction as well. which one is more practical” (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18830 802/human-computer-interaction-vs- interaction-design). HCI’s scope is (traditionally) narrower and does not include the wider aspects of theory, research and practice of user experience. It focuses only on the interdisciplinary overlapping areas, and it especially leans towards the technical aspects. Eat4Health example [2] When one starts using MyFitnessPal via Garmin, you first have to install the app as well from GooglePlay – this is a slightly irritating interface/user experience on a psychological level. One would have liked to see the linking running seamlessly/automatically in the background. The MyFitnessPal icon of a jumping person is a bit different from the running person used by Garmin Connect for one’s health stats. This hampers the intuitive use of the two apps – they do not form an integrated unit in terms of visual perception. INF3720/102/02/2020 4 1.2 Discuss the definitions, (main) goal, similarities and differences between the concepts of user experience and usability, and give an example of each of these concepts in relation to Eat4Health. Use the table structure below for your answer. (10) User experience Usability Definition [2] “how a product behaves and is used by people in the real world ... how people feel about a product and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it” (Preece et al., 2019:13). Usability is the degree to which a software application fulfils its purpose correctly. Usability can empirically be tested or measured in a laboratory. Main goal [2] “A diversity of user experience goals has been articulated in interaction design, which covers a range of emotions and felt experiences. These include desirable and undesirable ones” (Preece et al., 2019:22). “The concepts can be further defined in terms of elements that contribute to making a user experience pleasurable, fun, exciting, and so on” (Preece et al., 2019:23). “Usability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user’s perspective. It involves optimizing the interactions people have with interactive products to enable them to carry out their activities at work, at school, and in their everyday lives. More specifically, usability is broken down into the following six goals: ... effectiveness ... efficiency ... safety ... utility ... learnability, memorability” (Preece et al., 2019:19). Similarity [2] Includes pragmatic (and hedonic) aspects. “It is important to note, however, that the distinction between the two types of goals is not clear-cut since usability is often fundamental to the quality of the user experience and, conversely, aspects of the user experience, such as how it feels and looks, are inextricably linked with how usable the product is” (Preece et al., 2019:19). Focuses on pragmatic aspects. Difference [2] “... whereas user experience goals are concerned with explicating the nature of the user experience, for instance, to be aesthetically pleasing.” (Preece et al., 2019:19). More subjective. “Traditionally, usability goals are concerned with meeting specific usability criteria, such as efficiency ...” (Preece et al., 2019:19). More objective. Eat4Health example [2] Having two separate apps without proper integration affects the user’s subjective feeling about the Garmin Connect app. It makes it less pleasurable to use and even a bit frustrating and annoying. Linking the Garmin Connect app with MyFitnessPal provides extra functionality (e.g. tracking calory intake) to Garmin Connect ensuring better utility and effectiveness of the Garmin app, but it is not optimally efficient, learnable or memorable. INF3720/102/02/2020 5 Question 2 Total: 20 marks 2.1 Assume that the Eat4Health developers decided to improve the design of the app. You have been asked to plan the lifecycle of the interactive design for the new version. List and define the four basic (but essential) activities in the process of interaction design (ID). Also state how you plan to implement each activity during the interaction (re-)design of the app. Use the table structure below for your answer. (12) Name of ID activity [4] Definition of ID activity [4] How do you plan to implement this activity during the interaction design of the new version of the app? [4] 1. Discovering requirements for the interactive product Understanding a new need, the target users and the software support to be provided A questionnaire sent to Garmin users to find out if and how they would like to see MyFitnessPal to be integrated with Garmin Connect, what functionalities they would like to be included, etc. 2. Designing alternatives to address the requirements Proposing various software ideas to fill the identified gap – conceptual (abstract) and concrete (detailed) design. Compile a set of proposed screens to be used on the Garmin Connect app that use the same type of icons. Compile detailed specifications that clarify the new functionalities. 3. Prototyping the alternative designs Non-functional software examples, or paper-based models combined with role- play. Interface designs that can be demonstrated in a workshop to show the development team how users will be able to navigate between the various functionalities of the app. 4. Evaluating the product and the UX if offers Establishing the usability and suitability of a new design to improve the design or product before implementation. Testing the design using Garmin Connect users to ensure that the look and feel of the two apps will be the same. Use a working prototype to determine if the functionality is correct and how users experience the design on an emotional level. 2.2 How will you identify the users of the Eat4Health app and why is this important for the interaction design of the new version of the app? [2] I will get access to a year’s data from Garmin Connect users who also installed and linked MyFitnessPal, use data mining to identify usage patterns and then randomly select an equal number of users in each of these groups, to whom questionnaires will be sent. This is important to design the new version to cater to all large, diverse groups of users’ needs and to identify all stakeholders. INF3720/102/02/2020 6 2.3 How will you determine what the Eat4Health users’ needs are and why is this important for the interaction design of the new version of the app? [2] I will send out questionnaires with some open-ended questions to ask users what their needs are. I will also propose some “un-dreamed-of” options to find out how they would feel about new technologies that they did not know are possible. My questionnaire will not only focus on usability but also user experience goals. 2.4 How will you generate alternative designs for the new version of the Eat4Health app and why is this important for the interaction design of the new version of the app? [2] “[C]ross-fertilization of ideas from different perspectives, individuals, and contexts; the evolution of an existing product through use and observation; or straightforward copying of other, similar products” (p. 58). I will compare the new proposed version of the app with other dietary apps and try to improve on their accuracy and functionality. Or: Workshop ideas with a variety of experts in other industries. It is important to outperform the competition to attract and win users over. The new design should be more efficient and attractive to use. 2.5 How will you choose between alternative designs for the new version of the Eat4Health app and why is this important for the interaction design of the new version of the app? [2] Information gathered from Garmin Connect app users and usage data will inform my design decisions, e.g. touch screen ability for smartphones, automatic saving of data; externally visible and internal system characteristics; prototyping to test technical feasibility; determine measurable usability criteria. It is important to make proper design decisions before the software engineers start coding in order to ensure the efficiency of the building phase. INF3720/102/02/2020 7 Question 3 Total: 20 marks 3.1 Discuss the purpose and core components of conceptual models, and apply these components to the Eat4Health study case by suggesting new or improved functionalities or layout design aspects. Use the following table structure: (13) Purpose of conceptual models: [1] One of: A conceptual model is “intended to articulate the problem and design space”; “A model is a simplified description of a system or process that helps describe how it works”; “a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates”; to enable “designers to straighten out their thinking before they start laying out their widgets”; to provide “a working strategy and a framework of general concepts and their interrelations” (p. 74) (including secondary quotes from Johnson & Henderson, 2002). Core components [4] Discussion of component [4] Application of component [4] 1. Metaphors and analogies Convey to people how to understand what a product is used for and how to use it for an activity (e.g. browse & bookmark – page/scan through a book and insert an index card on a page that you want to revisit later; put/file a paper document in a metal cabinet, retrieve such a file and make an alphabetised index to assist users to locate files efficiently). In MyFitnessPal, I would add the analogy/metaphor of eating the best foods to maximise bodybuilding without using steroids and other medicines or chemical substances. 2. Concepts to which people are exposed through the product Digital objects that users can “create and manipulate, their attributes and the operations that can be performed on them” (p. 74) (e.g. – a digital version of a book (file), the number of pages in the book, paging through the book and inserting a stick-it note on a page that you want to refer back to; saving a digital file, revisiting a web page; organising the order of search results). A digital file is a concept; it has attributes such as its size and file type; the user can create it using an application, save it, edit it, search for it, etc. = operations/manipulations. In MyFitnessPal, the concept will be “Your goal” (building 5kg of muscle), the attributes will include various food types and the amounts that one has to take in daily, and the operations will be the data that you put in to record your progress and a progress bar that shows how you are doing in terms of meeting your goal. 3. Relationships between concepts How the concepts are connected and integrated (e.g. whether one object contains another: the Home ribbon in MS Word contains i.a. the Design and Layout menus). In MyFitnessPal, Goal should be a super-category for items such as body-building targets, losing weight, gaining weight, going keto, manage pre-diabetes, etc. 4. “The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to invoke or support” (p. 75) The link between task-domain objects (e.g. bookmarks – a list of favoured web sites that facilitates improved usability and elegant user experience, i.e. the user is enabled to revisit favourite sites easily without searching the web; the function that code fulfils to facilitate a wished-for UX that is created – the concept is looking up a favourite web page, the UX is an effective and efficient way to do it, and the mapping is the analysis, design and coding that makes it possible). In MyFitnessPal, the concept that I want to add is a new goal called “Maximise muscle gain” that can be activated by a sub-menu or button; the UX will be a pleasurable and easy way to plan the best diet for my goal; the mapping will be the link between the concept and the UX. i.e. the algorithm that has to be compiled to suggest the best foods and amounts to be taken daily, while tracking the user’s progress towards her goal. INF3720/102/02/2020 8 3.2 Search examples of HCI conceptual models on the internet and decide on one as the most suitable option to compile a conceptual model for the new version of the Eat4Health app. State clearly which example you are following, and give the related URL; motivate your choice; and compile a conceptual model of the most basic functionalities of the revised app. Your model should be consistent with the application in Question 3.1. (7) I used a hierarchical concept design found on ResearchGate because it is the most suitable to show the digital route that the user will follow to start and maintain her progress to eat the best foods to maximise her goal to gain 5 kg body muscle. Example (https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Concept-Map-Showing-the-Design-Categories-and- Question-Classifications-Question-Based-on_fig1_289109808): Conceptual model of the basic food intake functionalities of a new bodybuilding feature on MyFitnessPal: Bodybuilding Weight loss Muscle gain Weight gain Foods Exercise Carbohydrates Protein Fat One or more options INF3720/102/02/2020 9 Question 4 Total: 20 marks 4.1 Define face-to-face conversations, co-presence interventions and remote conversations (telepresence). State the benefits and disadvantages of each type of intervention. State how each of these conversation types could be used during the redesign of the Eat4Health app while keeping in mind that the team will have to meet during the Covid-19 pandemic. Use the following table format for your answer. (12) Face-to-face conversation [4] Co-presence intervention [4] Remote conversation [4] Definition Talking in-person to other people understanding the structure of human conversations, recognising and using implicit and explicit cues. “Supporting people in their activities when interacting in the same physical space” (p. 150). Talking to other people over a distance using ICTs (telepresence). The use of video to complement sound enhances the simulation of a normal conversation, although there are still differences and limitations. Benefits It is easier to coordinate a conversation using intuitive mechanisms (raising a hand, reading body language, making sounds like a-ha); an opportunity to ask for clarification Can replace or improve body language signals when hearing is not possible, e.g. projecting signals on large screens for large crowds (physical coordination); ICTs can be used to enhance group members’ awareness of each other and their environment (situation awareness); to enhance collaboration in teams; shareable interfaces can improve coordination and awareness mechanisms. Can create the impression of being there esp. if enhanced technologies are used; telepresence robots can replace humans; enables people to attend events if they cannot travel (COVID-19!). Disadvantages Conversations breakdowns occur if participants to not abide by the unwritten rules; misunderstandings. Participants can be intimidated by the technology; it can change real-life behaviour (for good or bad) The remote person’s movement is restricted; it may be difficult to gauge your own volume when speaking Possible use during the redesign of Eat4Health Having face-to-face conversations with trainers and dieticians can complement the new bodybuilding facility – the app can suggest professionals in the user’s area and facilitate making appointments. The user can join a group of bodybuilders and they can support each other by sharing their progress and tips in a meeting room where the project progress graphs etc. on a big screen (i.e. when gyms reopen after the lockdown) – the app could add this facility. During a lockdown the bodybuilders can use the MyFitnessApp to stay in touch and to work together to reach their goals while exercising and dieting at home. The app can simulate the experience of group work in the gym ) – the app could add this facility. INF3720/102/02/2020 10 4.2 Explain what is meant by social interaction and social presence. (2)  Social interaction is the phenomenon that people communicate, coordinate and collaborate, being aware of what others do, informing others about your activities, managing conversations.  Social presence is “the feeling of being there with a real person in virtual reality. Specifically, it refers to the degree of awareness, feeling, and reaction to other people who are virtually present in an online environment” (p. 146). [Also see p. 146 for the difference between telepresence and social presence.] 4.3 Write a critical discussion of how social media can be used to enhance the Eat4Health app. In your discussion, include potential new social phenomena (good and bad) as intended or unintended consequences of the new design. (6) Social media can be used to enhance the Eat4Health app by providing alternative ways (using a digital app) for bodybuilders to keep in touch and to control this aspect of their social lives during a lockdown period when gyms are closed – e.g. by linking the app to integrate seamlessly with a WhatsApp group; and to enable people to connect who would not have been able to do it in other ways, e.g. to connect bodybuilders with other people who are struggling to maintain their weight over distances.(2)  A new intended good social phenomenon could be pro-social behaviour such as connecting isolated weight gainers during the lockdown to support each other for free. (1)  A new intended bad social phenomenon could be ... hopefully, nothing unless the designers are sociopaths ;) (1)  A new unintended good social phenomenon could be that the weight gainers use it to warn each other of unrelated dangers such as a sudden rise in COVID infections in their area calling for digital volunteers to assist at hospitals. (1)  A new unintended bad social phenomenon could be that members of the bodybuilding group become obsessive to check and post message thus hampering their working-from-home productivity during a lockdown. (1) INF3720/102/02/2020 11 Question 5 Total: 20 marks With reference to emotional interaction, compare pleasurable interfaces (and other positive design elements) with annoying interfaces (and other negative design elements). Give one example of an annoying interface for each of these design elements of the current version of Eat4Health. Make a recommendation on how this annoying interface element could be replaced with a pleasurable interface element in the new version of the app. Use the following table format: (20) Design element Annoying interfaces Pleasurable interfaces a) Visceral design [4] Definition: design intended to appeal to the visceral part of the brain (often sensory impulses) triggering automatic responses to physical events/ triggering quick emotional responses – an annoying interface on this level is e.g. the use of different font types in one paragraph, crowded web pages, or irritating pop- ups about cookies. Eat4Health example: the lack of seamless integration of MyFitnessPal into Garmin Connect. Installing MyFitnessPal is annoying: it asks for a password even if you have never used it before. Definition: a pleasurable interface on the visceral design level is one the creates a good feeling in the user e.g. a clean/minimalistic layout of a webpage; design to make products pleasurable to experience with their senses; colourful, attractive design. Eat4Health recommendation: Garmin should create its own dieting app and integrate it seamlessly into Connect, or create a better-integrating interface. b) Behavioural/reflective level [4] Definition – behavioural level: “the brain processes that control everyday behavior ... routine operations”. Reflexive level: “brain processes involved in contemplating ... conscious thought”. An annoying interface on these levels will entice unacceptable social behaviour, such as enticing striking workers to use violence; or to nurture negative thoughts. Eat4Health example: a single-minded paradigm about what constitutes a healthy diet thus giving wrong advice to people who actually need a different option, e.g. to control diabetes. Definition – behavioural level “how to make products useful” (good usability); intuitive affordances (p. 30, 172) Reflective design: “considering the meaning and personal value of a product in a particular culture” (p. 171). A pleasurable interface on these levels is e.g. an ergonomically designed mouse that prevents carpal tunnel syndrome by enforcing an ideal way to hold and move a mouse; a design that appeals to the user’s own culture e.g. using baskets instead of menus in rural Africa. Eat4Health recommendation: thinking how African cultural images can be used for the local use of the new muscle gain facility to appeal to Africans. INF3720/102/02/2020 12 c) Feedback-level [4] Definition: a design element that informs the user of an app’s status in a way – usually unintentionally – that stimulates negative feelings, e.g. error messages that keep on popping up/flashing or vague error messages. Eat4Health Example: A Garmin user would like to have all feedback in one central forum; the lack of a dieting Garmin app and difficult linking to MyFitnessPal is an annoying way of giving diet feedback to Garmin users. Definition: a design element that gives positive or constructive feedback to the user, e.g. animated icons, sonifications and vibrotactile feedback to inform the user of an app’s status. Eat4Health Recommendation: Garmin could buy over MyFitnessApp and integrate it seamlessly with the rest of the Connect app, while allowing non- Garmin users to use the part of the app too (thus also encouraging them to start using Garmin and Connect) d) Persuasive level [4] Definition: interfaces that are designed to inform people enticing them to do something or to change their thinking, e.g. pop-ups and warning messages. A negative example is phishing messages trying to convince users to give away their personal or banking information. Eat4Health example: Garmin users are encouraged to use an outside app to track their dieting intake while Connect estimates their calories use. Definition .... interfaces that entice people to change their behaviours for their own well-being, e.g. positive rewards for exercise targets; sustainable HCI; Apps that analyse drivers’ facial expressions and react to keep them awake, calm them or advise them. Eat4Health recommendation: Buy MyFitnessApp and integrate it seamlessly with the rest of the Connect app, while allowing non- Garmin users to use the part of the app too (thus also encouraging them to start using Garmin and Connect) e) Mood elements [4] Definition: a design element that changes the user’s mood negatively, e.g. an expressive interface that causes sadness, anger, frustration; childish, intrusive, insulting, patronising, threatening, distracting interfaces. Eat4Health example: having to switch apps from Garmin Connect to MyFitnessPal can irritate new Garmin customers and cause frustration. Definition: a design element that changes the user’s mood positively, e.g. an expressive interface that causes feelings of happiness and comfort, friendliness, reassurance, simple and beautiful designs that ensure enjoyable experiences, anthropomorphism and zoomorphism. Eat4Health Recommendation: a well- integrated diet Garmin app, using the same icons and giving constructive advice. Total: 100 © Unisa 2020","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
