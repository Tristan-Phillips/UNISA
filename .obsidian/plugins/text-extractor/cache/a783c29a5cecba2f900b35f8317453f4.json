(2015) conducted another study involving writing an essay under 2 conditions: relevant or irrelevant information – heavy multitaskers were easily distracted but able to put this to good use if the distracting sources were relevant to the task in hand – irrelevant information was found to negatively impact task performance www.id-book.com Multitasking at work • Increasingly common for workers to multitask – e.g. hospital workers have to attend to multiple screens in an operating room that provide new kinds of real-time information – requires clinician’s constant attention to check if any data is unusual or anomalous – need to develop new attention and scanning strategies www.id-book.com Is it OK to use a phone when driving? www.id-book.com No! – Driving is very demanding – Drivers are prone to being distracted – There is a significant chance of causing accidents – Drivers’ reaction times are longer to external events when talking on the phone in a car (Caird et al., 2018) – Phone drivers rely more on their expectations about what is likely to happen next as conversation taking up their attention – Response time is slower to unexpected events (Briggs et al., 2018) – Drivers often try to imagine what the other person’s face is like – whom they are talking to • this competes with the processing resources needed to enable them to notice and react to what is in front of them www.id-book.com Are hands-free phones safer to use when driving? • No, as same type of cognitive processing is happening when talking • Same happens when talking with front seat passenger – but both can stop in mid-sentence if see a hazard meaning driver can switch immediately to the road – So less dangerous talking to a front seat passenger than a remote person – a remote person on the end of a phone is not privy to what the driver is seeing and will carry on the conversation when there is a hazard – makes it difficult for the driver to switch all their attention to the road www.id-book.com Design implications for attention • Context: Make information salient when it needs attending to at a given stage of a task • Use techniques to achieve this – e.g. color, ordering, spacing, underlining, sequencing and animation • Avoid cluttering visual interfaces with too much information • Consider designing different ways of supporting effective switching and returning to an interface www.id-book.com Perception • How information is acquired from the world and transformed into experiences • Obvious implication is to design representations that are readily perceivable, e.g. – Text should be legible – Icons should be easy to distinguish and read www.id-book.com Is color contrast good? Find Italian www.id-book.com Are borders and white space better? Find french www.id-book.com Activity • Weller (2004) found people took less time to locate items for information that was grouped – using a border (2nd screen) compared with using color contrast (1st screen) • Some argue that too much white space on web pages is detrimental to search process – Makes it hard to find information • Do you agree? www.id-book.com Activity: Which is easiest to read and why? What is the time? What is the time? What is the time? What is the time? What is the time? www.id-book.com Design implications • Icons should enable users to readily distinguish their meaning • Bordering and spacing are effective visual ways of grouping information • Sounds should be audible and distinguishable • Research proper color contrast techniques when designing an interface – Yellow on black or blue is fine – Yellow on green or white is a no-no • Haptic feedback should be used judiciously www.id-book.com Memory • Involves recalling various kinds of knowledge that allow people to act appropriately – e.g. recognize someone’s face, remember someone’s name • First encode and then retrieve knowledge • We don’t remember everything - involves filtering and processing what is attended to • Context is important as to how we remember (i.e. where, when) • We recognize things much better than being able to recall things • We remember less about objects we have photographed than when we observe them with the naked eye (Henkel, 2014) www.id-book.com Processing in memory • Encoding is first stage of memory – determines which information is attended to in the environment and how it is interpreted • The more attention paid to something… • The more it is processed in terms of thinking about it and comparing it with other knowledge… • The more likely it is to be remembered – e.g. when learning about HCI, it is much better to reflect upon it, carry out exercises, have discussions with others about it, and write notes than just passively read a book, listen to a lecture or watch a video about it www.id-book.com Context is important • Context affects the extent to which information can be subsequently retrieved • Sometimes it can be difficult for people to recall information that was encoded in a different context: – “You are on a train and someone comes up to you and says hello. You don’t recognize him for a few moments but then realize it is one of your neighbors. You are only used to seeing your neighbor in the hallway of your apartment block and seeing him out of context makes him difficult to recognize initially” www.id-book.com Activity • Try to remember the dates of your grandparents’ birthday • Try to remember the cover of the last two books you read • Which was easiest? Why? • People are very good at remembering visual cues about things – e.g. the color of items, the location of objects and marks on an object • They find it more difficult to learn and remember arbitrary material – e.g. birthdays and phone numbers www.id-book.com Recognition versus recall • Command-based interfaces require users to recall from memory a name from a possible set of 100s • Graphical interfaces provide visually-based options (menus, icons) that users need only browse through until they recognize one • Web browsers provide tabs and history lists of visited URLs that support recognition memory www.id-book.com The problem with the classic ‘72’ • George Miller’s (1956) theory of how much information people can remember • People’s immediate memory capacity is very limited to 7 2 • Has been applied in interaction design when considering how many options to display • But is it a good use of a theory in HCI? • Is it helpful? www.id-book.com When creating an interface should the designer • Present only 7 options on a menu • Display only 7 icons on a tool bar • Have no more than 7 bullets in a list • Place only 7 items on a pull down menu • Place only 7 tabs on the top of a website page? • Not necessarily.. www.id-book.com The reason is… • People can scan lists of bullets, tabs, menu items for the one they want • They don’t have to recall them from memory having only briefly heard or seen them • So can have more than 9 at the interface (e.g. history lists of websites visited) • Sometimes a small number of items is good – e.g. smart watch displays • Depends on task and available screen estate www.id-book.com Personal Information management • Is a growing problem for many users – they accumulate a vast numbers of documents, images, music files, video clips, emails, attachments, bookmarks, etc., – where and how to save them all, then remembering what they were called and where to find them again – naming most common means of encoding them – but can be difficult to remember, especially when have 10,000s – How might such a process be facilitated taking into account people’s memory abilities? www.id-book.com Personal Information management • Bergman and Whittaker 3 interdependent processes model (2016) to help people manage their stuff: (i) how to decide what stuff to keep (ii) how to organize it when storing (iii) which strategies to use to retrieve it later • Most common approach is to use folders and naming • Strong preference for scanning across and within folders when looking for something • Search engines only helpful if know the name of the file • Smart search engines help with listing relevant files for partial name or when type in first letter www.id-book.com Apple’s Spotlight search tool www.id-book.com Memory load • Online/mobile and phone banking now require users to provide multiple pieces of information to access their account – e.g. ZIP code, birthplace, a memorable date, first school attended – Known as multifactor authentication (MFA) • Why? – Increased security concerns • Password managers such as LastPass have been developed - only need one master password – Reduce stress and memory load on users • Passwords could become extinct with the widespread use of biometrics and computer vision algorithms www.id-book.com Digital Forgetting • When might you wish to forget something that is online? – When you break up with a partner – Emotionally painful to be reminded of them through shared photos, social media, etc., • Sas and Whittaker (2013) suggest ways of harvesting and deleting digital content – e.g. making photos of ex into an abstract collage – helps with closure www.id-book.com Memory aids • SenseCam developed by Microsoft Research Labs (now Autographer) – a wearable device that intermittently takes photos without any user intervention while worn – digital images taken are stored and revisited using special software – has been found to improve people’s memory, especially those suffering from dementia • Other aids include RemArc which triggers long term memory using old BBC materials www.id-book.com SenseCam www.id-book.com Design implications • Reduce cognitive load by avoiding long and complicated procedures for carrying out tasks • Design interfaces that promote recognition rather than recall • Provide users with various ways of labelling digital information to help them easily identify it again – e.g. folders, categories, color, flagging, time stamping www.id-book.com Learning • Involves the accumulation of skills and knowledge involving memory • Two main types: – Incidental learning (e.g. recognizing people’s faces, what you did today) – intentional learning (e.g. studying for an exam, learning to cook) – Intentional learning is much harder! – Many technologies have been developed to help (e.g. multimedia, animations, VR) • People find it hard to learn by following instructions in a manual • Prefer to learn by doing www.id-book.com Design implications • Design interfaces that encourage exploration • Design interfaces that constrain and guide learners • Dynamically linking concepts and representations can facilitate the learning of complex material www.id-book.com Reading, speaking, and listening • The ease with which people can read, listen, or speak differs – Many prefer listening to reading – Reading can be quicker than speaking or listening – Listening requires less cognitive effort than reading or speaking – Dyslexics have difficulties understanding and recognizing written words www.id-book.com Applications • Voice user interfaces allow users to interact with them by asking questions – e.g. Google Voice, Siri, Alexa • Speech-output systems use artificially generated speech – e.g. written-text-to-speech systems for the visually impaired • Natural-language systems enable users to type in questions and give text-based responses – e.g. chatbots www.id-book.com Design implications • Speech-based menus and instructions should be short • Accentuate the intonation of artificially generated speech voices – they are harder to understand than human voices • Provide opportunities for making text large on a screen www.id-book.com Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making • All these processes involve reflective cognition – e.g. thinking about what to do, what the options are, and the consequences • Often involves conscious processes, discussion with others (or oneself), and the use of artifacts – e.g. maps, books, pen and paper • May involve working through different scenarios and deciding which is best option • Weighing up alternatives www.id-book.com Design implications • Provide information and help pages that are easy to access for people who wish to understand more about how to carry out an activity more effectively (e.g. web searching) • Use simple and memorable functions to support rapid decision-making and planning www.id-book.com Dilemma • The app mentality is making it worse for people to make their own decisions because they are becoming risk averse (Gardner and Davis, 2013) – Instead they now rely on a multitude of apps – This makes them increasingly anxious – Unable to make decisions by themselves – Need to resort to looking up info, getting other’s opinions on social media and comparing notes • Do you agree? • Did it happen to you when deciding which university/school to go to? www.id-book.com Cognitive frameworks • These are used to explain and predict user behavior at the interface – based on theories of behavior – focus is on mental processes that take place – Also use of artifacts and representations • Most well known are: – Mental models – Gulfs of execution and evaluation – Distributed cognition – External and embodied cognition www.id-book.com Mental models • Users develop an understanding of a system through learning about and using it • Knowledge is sometimes described as a mental model: – how to use the system (what to do next) – what to do with unfamiliar systems or unexpected situations (how the system works) • People make inferences using mental models of how to carry out tasks www.id-book.com Mental models • Craik (1943) described mental models as: – internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made • Involves unconscious and conscious processes – imagery and analogies are activated • Deep versus shallow models – e.g. how to drive a car and how it works www.id-book.com Everyday reasoning and mental models (a) You arrive home on a cold winter’s night to a cold house. How do you get the house to warm up as quickly as possible? Set the thermostat to be at its highest or to the desired temperature? (b) You arrive home starving hungry. You look in the fridge and find all that is left is an uncooked pizza. You have an electric oven. Do you warm it up to 375 degrees first and then put it in (as specified by the instructions) or turn the oven up higher to try to warm it up quicker? www.id-book.com Heating up a room or oven that is thermostat-controlled • Many people when asked (a) choose the first option • Why? – Think It will heat the room up quicker – General valve theory, where ‘more is more’ principle is generalised to different settings (e.g. gas pedal, gas cooker, tap, radio volume) – Burt it is a wrong mental model as thermostats based on model of on-off switch model • Many people when asked (b) choose the first option – Electric ovens work on the same principle as thermostats • Most of us have erroneous mental models (Kempton, 1996) www.id-book.com Erroneous mental models • Lots of people hit the button for elevators and pedestrian crossings at least twice – Why? Think it will make the lights change faster or ensure the elevator arrives! • What kinds of mental models do users have for understanding how interactive devices work? – poor, often incomplete, easily confusable, based on inappropriate analogies and superstition (Norman, 1983) www.id-book.com How can UX be designed to help people build better mental models? • Clear and easy to use instructions • Appropriate tutorials and contextual sensitive guidance • Provide online videos and chatbot windows when needing help • Transparency – to make interfaces intuitive to use • Affordances of what actions an interface allows – e.g. swiping, clicking, selecting www.id-book.com Gulfs of execution and evaluation • The ‘gulfs’ explicate the gaps that exist between the user and the interface • The gulf of execution – the distance from the user to the physical system • The gulf of evaluation – the distance from the physical system to the user • Bridging the gulfs can reduce cognitive effort required to perform tasks • Can reveal whether interface increases or decreases cognitive load and whether it is obvious what to do next Norman, 1986; Hutchins et al, 1986 www.id-book.com Bridging the gulfs www.id-book.com Information processing • Conceptualizes human performance in metaphorical terms of information processing stages www.id-book.com Limitations • Based on modelling mental activities that happen exclusively inside the head • Do not adequately account for how people interact with computers and other devices in real world www.id-book.com Distributed cognition • Concerned with the nature of cognitive phenomena across individuals, artifacts, and internal and external representations (Hutchins, 1995) • Describes these in terms of propagation across representational state • Information is transformed through different media (computers, displays, paper, heads) www.id-book.com A cognitive system for ATC www.id-book.com What’s involved • The distributed problem-solving that takes place • The role of verbal and non-verbal behavior • The various coordinating mechanisms that are used (e.g. rules, procedures) • The communication that takes place as the collaborative activity progresses • How knowledge is shared and accessed www.id-book.com External cognition • Concerned with explaining how we interact with external representations (e.g. maps, notes, diagrams) • What are the cognitive benefits and what processes involved • How they extend cognition • What technologies can we develop to help people carry out complex tasks (e.g. learning, problem solving, decision-making)? www.id-book.com Externalizing to reduce memory load • Examples include the use of diaries, reminders, calendars, notes, shopping lists, to-do lists – written to remind us of what to do • Post-its, piles, marked emails are used to: – where placed indicates priority of what to do • External representations: – Remind us that we need to do something (e.g. to buy something for mother’s day) – Remind us of what to do (e.g. buy a card) – Remind us when to do something (e.g. send a card by a certain date) www.id-book.com Computational offloading • When a tool is used in conjunction with an external representation to carry out a computation (e.g. pen and paper) • Try doing the two sums below (a) in your head, (b) on a piece of paper and c) with a calculator. 234 x 456 =?? CCXXXIIII x CCCCXXXXXVI = ??? • Which is easiest and why? Both are identical sums www.id-book.com Annotation and cognitive tracing • Annotation involves modifying existing representations through making marks – e.g. crossing off, ticking, underlining • Cognitive tracing involves externally manipulating items into different orders or structures – e.g. playing Scrabble, playing cards www.id-book.com Design implication • Provide external representations at the interface that can reduce memory load and facilitate computational offloading – e.g. Information visualizations have been designed to allow people to make sense and rapid decisions about masses of data www.id-book.com Embodied Interaction • The practical engagement with the social and physical environment (Dourish, 2001) • Creating, manipulating and making meaning through our interaction with things • How our bodies and active experiences shape how we perceive, feel, and think (Hornecker et al., 2017) • They enable us to develop a sense of the world at both a concrete and abstract level • Can provide new ideas about interaction and better design principles – e.g. we think with our bodies not through them (Kirsh, 2013) www.id-book.com Summary • Cognition involves many processes including attention, memory, perception and learning • The way an interface is designed can greatly affect how well users can perceive, attend, learn and remember how to do their tasks • Theoretical frameworks, such as mental models and external cognition, provide ways of understanding how and why people interact with products • This can lead to thinking about how to design better products www.id-book.com In-depth activity Write down how you think a contactless card or smartphone app like Apple Pay works • What information is sent between the card/smartphone and the card reader when it is placed in front of it? • What is the maximum amount you can pay for something using a contactless card, Apple Pay or Google Pay? • Why is there an upper limit? • How many times can you use a contactless card or Apple/Google Pay in a day? • What happens if you have two contactless cards in the same wallet/purse? • What happens when your contactless card is stolen and you report it to the bank? What does the bank do? www.id-book.com","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
