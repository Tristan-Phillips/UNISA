To this end the management of Unisa took a decision that there will be no face- to-face contact activities during the year, including examinations. As such, the examination of this module, like all other modules at Unisa, will be conducted online. Exam tutorial letter will be sent to students later. 2 PURPOSE OF TUTORIAL LETTER This tutorial letter provides solution guidelines for Assignment 01, 02, 03,and 04. Assignments based on MCQ questions were automatically marked by the Assignment department. Assignments based on structured questions, were marked by the lecturer with help of some markers, who have knowledge of the module matter. Even though different people marked the assignments, they were guided by the memos provided in this tutorial letter. Note that, Assignments 01 and 03 were self-evaluation assessments as stated in TL001. Even though the Assignments were self-evaluation, I decided that Assignment 01 be strictly marked in the same way the exams are marked. Due to the strictness of the markers, some students may not be happy with the marks that they received. You are advised to compare your answers with the provided memo and to learn from the memo. For each answer, the memo refers to the pages of the prescribed book where you can find the answers. Assignment 03 was not marked. Students were awarded marks based on the questions that they attempted to answer. Students cannot get marks for questions that they did not attempt. This is a self-evaluation assignment. Use the provided memo to learn how to answer the questions and evaluate yourself. The mark reflected on your assignment is not a true reflection of your performance, is a sign that you attempted to answer the questions. A few students submitted wrong assignments. According to my experience, this could be intentional, a calculated mistake by some students. Due to that, anyone who submitted a wrong assignments or blank answer sheet was allocated a mark of zero. 4 INF3720/203/1/2021 If you would want to request a remark for Assignment 01, you need to do a self-evaluation first. Thereafter, for each question that you are querying, provide some academic argument why you think your answer is correct. Avoid basing your request for a remark based on your feelings, that you think that you do not deserve a lower mark. Do not tell me that you are frustrated by the marker because you are an experienced software developer, to me, you are all good students who are here to learn. Please be academic, provide some reasons supporting what you are requesting for. For the students who have already requested a remark, please follow these instructions. For a remark, email your marked scripts and your academic argument to the email provided below. chipab@unisa.ac.za 2.1 Assignment 01 Solutions Total marks: 100 (100%) CASE STUDY: USER EXPERIENCE OF TELEGRAM For this assignment you should use the Telegram messaging app that is downloadable for free on all major platforms (https://telegram.org/). The case study following below is hypothetical. Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) is a private tutoring company in South Africa that provides tutoring services to students who are enrolled for diplomas and degrees in Information Systems at various colleges and universities. In the past, ITS’s tutors have been using WhatsApp to communicate with their students, but the company has decided to consider other options due to concerns about WhatsApp’s new terms and conditions that will be implemented in 2021. ITS considers three alternatives: • Switching to Telegram (as is) as an alternative messaging app • Developing its own Africanised messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients • Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localise the app for the South African market Assume that you have been appointed by Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) as an HCI expert. Management has tasked you to do a user experience evaluation of Telegram as a possible alternative. If ITS decides to adopt Telegram, you will have to manage all aspects of interaction design (ID) related to the current version of the product and possible future enhancements or alternatives planned for the South African market. IMPORTANT NOTE ON PLAGIARISM Please note that all exam scripts will be put through a plagiarism checking tool. Scripts with a high similarity index will receive a zero mark. You are not allowed to copy any text from the textbook or slides; other students’ notes or answers; templates, memos or model answers from any previous assignments, online tutors, the internet or any other sources. All questions must be answered in your own, original words. HOW MARKS WILL BE ALLOCATED Most of the questions below have a wide scope, therefore allowing more than one correct answer. You should receive marks for theoretical statements and marks for each feasible application to the case study. In each 5 INF3720/203/1/2021 question there should be a 50/50 balance between theory and practice. Consequently, if you only give theoretical “facts”, you can only get a maximum of 50% of the maximum marks for that specific question. QUESTION 1 – CHAPTER 1: WHAT IS INTERACTION DESIGN? (20) Write a memo of 300 words to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of ITS, whom you report to, explaining how you would apply your theoretical knowledge of the following concepts to plan your activities as interaction-design manager (discuss and apply the theoretical concepts to the case study): 1.1 Human-computer interaction (2) [p. 10-11] 1.2 User experience (2) [p. 2, 13-15] 1.3 Usability (4) [p. 19-22] 1.4 The issue of cultural differences with reference to interaction design (2) [p. 15-16] 1.5 The most common design principles (10) [p. 26-31] ANSWER GUIDELINES/EXAMPLES NOTE: For the purposes of this assignment, we will refer to the case study options stated above, as follows: • Adopt: Switching to Telegram (as is) as an alternative messaging app • Adapt: Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localise the app for the South African market • Build: Developing its own Africanised messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients THEORY APPLICATION: HCI-related comments and questions to be considered by the ITS CIO to guide the Exco on the decision to adopt, adapt or build 1.1 Human-computer interaction (HCI) (2) [p. 10- 11] HCI is the discipline that focuses on “the design and usability of computing systems”, but the scope is often widened to include other interactive design aspects such as “theory, research, and practice of designing user experiences”.✓ Is Telegram’s interface similar enough to WhatsApp so that users (tutors and students) will find it easy to switch, and does it facilitate the same functionalities? How can ITS evaluate the design of Telegram to determine the probable user experience? ✓ 1.2 User experience (UX) (2) [p. 2, 13-15] UX refers – in a narrow sense of the term – to how users feel about a software product which they are using: does the program/app cause positive or negative reactions, and is it considered as being useful?✓ How will the ITS tutors and students feel about having to install another app and to switch from WhatsApp? Is Telegram’s user interface intuitive to be used by South African users? ✓ 1.3 Usability (4) [p. 19-22] The usability of a software product is determined by how well it fulfils its purpose✓ in an efficient, intuitive and safe way.✓ Does Telegram allow group discussions (e.g., between a tutor and her students)? What is the maximum size of groups – will a tutor be able to use one group per module? Is Telegram safer than WhatsApp – does it protect users’ (tutor and students) personal information better? What is the maximum length of a Telegram message? ✓ ✓ 6 INF3720/203/1/2021 1.4 The issue of cultural differences with reference to interaction design (2) [p. 15-16]: Cultural constructs often underlie/are built into software, implying that a program or app that has been developed for a specific group may not necessarily be regarded as intuitive to use by members of another group/culture.✓ Can ITS assume that Telegram’s interface is universally acceptable, or are there built-in cultural constructs that are not intuitive or acceptable for South African users? Can the date format be changed from US style “March 08” to SA style “8 March”? Do users in rural communities with basic levels of computer literacy understand the menu metaphor (three horisontal lines) intuitively? ✓ 1.5 The most common design principles (10) [p. 26-31] – Any five of: Visibility/Findability: how easy is it for users to know how to locate and activate a function?✓ Navigability: how easy is it for users to know how to move on to the next step?✓ Feedback: does the system tell the user what function has been activated and what has been accomplished, and how quickly does it do this?✓ Constraints: does the system restrict inputs from the user to allow only permissible actions?✓ Consistency: does the system use similar interface elements for similar operations?✓ Affordance: does the system facilitate intuitive use?(✓) How easy is it for tutors to create a new group for a module?✓ How easy is it for students to join a module group after installing the Telegram app?✓ Does the Telegram interface update the tutor and the student that (s)he has successfully joined a module group?✓ Does the Telegram software prevent messages containing rude language?✓ Does the Telegram software use icons that tutors and students are familiar with, and are these used consistently for similar functions across the app?✓ Is the Telegram interface easy and intuitive to use, e.g., is the icon that is used to delete a message (wastebin) easy to understand for a user in a rural area? Or does it look like something else, e.g., a woven basket used to store items in traditional African homes (which could cause confusion)?(✓) QUESTION 2 – CHAPTER 2: THE PROCESS OF INTERACTION DESIGN (20) Write a memo of 300 words to the CIO explaining how you plan to carry out a user-experience evaluation of the current version of Telegram within the ITS environment, as well as the design of possible improvements. Refer to the following in your answer, applying the theoretical concepts to the case study: 2.1 The basic activities of user-centred interaction design as applied to Telegram within the ITS environment (4) [p. 38-43/p. 50] 2.2 Involving users during all the stages of interaction design and development of Telegram improvements (4) [p. 43-49] 2.3 A simple lifecycle model for interaction design for Telegram improvements (4) [p. 51-52] 7 INF3720/203/1/2021 2.4 Ways to understand users and their needs/goals when using Telegram (4) [p. 55-57] 2.5 Ways to find inspiration to effectively design alternative (or better) solutions for Telegram (4) [p. 58] ANSWER GUIDELINES/EXAMPLES THEORY APPLICATION 2.1 Basic activities of user-centred interaction design: [p. 50] • Discovering requirements (gaining insight in problems) • Designing alternatives (conceptual and concrete design ideas suggested to meet requirements) • Prototyping (paper-based models or working software that show the planned interfaces) • Evaluating (determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design) ✓✓ Applied to Telegram within the ITS environment: • What functions do e-tutors need to ensure efficient communication with students? • How do WhatsApp and Telegram’s functions compare? Are there any missing functionalities? • If Telegram should be adapted or if a new tailor-made app should be developed, prototypes/models/samples should be made to test the design before coding starts/progresses too far. • Telegram’s usability and accessibility should be evaluated before adopting it as an alternative for WhatsApp. ✓✓ 2.2 Involving users during all the stages of interaction design and development [p. 43- 49]: It is important to involve users during all phases of interaction design to ensure that the product will meet their requirements and will be accepted by them. Expectation management and ownership. A balance must be found between part-time and full-time involvement to facilitate fair workloads. A user-centred approach will ensure that the new applications are driven by real users and their needs and not by what is technologically possible. Real users may have different perspectives from developers and proxy users ✓✓ Tutors and students should be asked if any Telegram improvements are necessary (participatory design/early focus on users and tasks). Users must be involved to manage their expectations. This is to improve the acceptance of the product when delivered. When users are involved they feel that the end product is theirs. A balance has to be found between part- time and full-time involvement allowing enough time for tutoring and studying itself. If the app is adapted, all users can be asked to complete a survey to determine the usability and user experience of the new version (empirical measurement). Cycles of design, test and measure should be used if a new app is to be developed (iterative design). ✓✓ 2.3 A simple lifecycle model for interaction design [p. 51-52] ✓✓ Application for Telegram improvement following various iterations of the following: • Discovering requirements: what are tutors’ and students’ communication needs? • Designing alternatives: can Telegram be adopted, or should it be adapted, or should a new app be developed? • Prototyping: if a new app is needed, develop a series of digital screens to 8 INF3720/203/1/2021 simulate the new app. • Evaluating: test the prototypes empirically by using focus groups and role-play using these sample screens. • Final product: implement the new or Africanised version of the app and phase out the use of WhatsApp. ✓✓ 2.4 Ways to understand users and their needs/goals: [p. 55-57] • Who are the users? Taking into account diversity; general or constrained user communities. Stakeholders are more/wider than users, less or more relevant and involved. • What are the users’ needs? Include those needs that users are unaware of. Explore the problem space. Try out a pilot. Focus on people’s goals, usability and UX goals. ✓✓ Who will use the adopted or adapted version of Telegram, or a new custom-made app? Do they represent different cultural groups? Are there any users with disabilities? How are ITS’s managers and administrators involved? What do the tutors and students need? Should it be possible to upload pdf copies of model answers in a legible format on a smart phone screen (students may not be aware of this need)? ✓✓ 2.5 Ways to find inspiration to effectively design alternative (or better) solutions: [p. 58] • Determine gaps/flaws in the current versions of similar software. • Brainstorm ideas with designers. • Look for ideas in related but different technologies. • Ask experts in other fields to identify analogies between the fields. • Suggest incremental upgrades to improve existing products. ✓✓ • Which functionalities are offered by WhatsApp that are not available in Telegram? • How can African art be used to change icons to be more intuitive for local usage? • Are there other apps, such as Signal, Zoom and Skype, that have extra useful functionalities? • Ask colleagues in communication sciences and hermeneutics to suggest ways to enhance communication in social media. • Which existing functions in Telegram can be improved? ✓✓ QUESTION 3 – CHAPTER 3: CONCEPTUALISING INTERACTION (20) 3.1 Assume that you are planning to use a group of new users of Telegram (i.e., ITS tutors and clients who have not used the app before) to evaluate the current version of the app. How will you make use of the core components of conceptual models to explain the functionalities of the app to these ‘newbies’? (10) [p. 75, 78-80.] 3.2 Thinyane, Gavaza and Terzoli (2011) researched the use of a basket metaphor rather than a drop-down list to show how alternative cultural constructs can be built into human-computer interfaces. [Thinyane, H., Gavaza, T. and Terzoli. A. 2011. “An Investigation into Culturally-Relevant GUI Components within Marginalised South African Communities.” In ICT for Development: People, Policy and Practice, IDIA2011 Conference Proceedings, 177–190.] A copy of the paper is available on Additional Resources (Assignment 1). Read the paper and explain to the CIO how the concept of metaphors can be used to Africanise the interface of the Telegram app. Suggest three new metaphors that could be used to Africanise the app. (10) [p. 75, 78-80.] 9 INF3720/203/1/2021 MODEL ANSWER 3.1 THEORY [p. 75-77] APPLICATION Conceptual models are simplified descriptions of software applications that help us to understand the problem and design space, how the app is organised and works. It provides “a framework of general concepts and their interrelations”.✓ Telegram is a messaging app. It simulates paper-based circulars that are sent to one or many people to announce information, tasks or requests. Instead of writing comments on a form that is attached to a circular, users can reply directly to the sender or the whole group.✓ Metaphors and analogies refer to known objects and procedures in the physical world that form the bases/foundations of their digital representations.✓ The delete icon in Telegram is a picture of a wastebin. The metaphor is supposed to “afford” users to delete a message, the idea being that users will know intuitively to click on the icon to delete an item.✓ However, one cannot assume that all cultural groups will understand such an icon intuitively in the same way.✓ Concepts, such as task domain objects refer to the elements and functions (objects) that form part of the software.✓ A message is the basic concept in Telegram. Messages can be written, sent, forwarded, deleted and searched.✓ Relationships between concepts refer to how software objects are related to each other.✓ The hamburger icon (three small horisontal lines) on the top left is a digital button that represents a list. It contains a menu of other options/functions.✓ Mappings between concepts and UX refer to how functions are performed on software elements to simulate physical actions in a digital environment.✓ To access other functions that are not shown on the landing page of Telegram, the user should click on the hamburger menu icon. This will open a list of options, such as to change the app settings, to invite friends or to create a new group. Answers to frequently asked questions can be accessed directly from here or indirectly via Settings thus making it easy to find help.✓ 3.2 The use of metaphors impacts on the user experience of software [p. 78-80.].✓ The design team at ITS should find obvious and simple metaphors that are intuitive to use for Africans in rural areas.✓ If ITS decides to develop a new app, it should do research about typical ways in which African communities share information and communicate when collaborating in groups.✓ These cultural practices could stimulate innovative ideas as the underlying foundation for a more intuitive interface.✓ The concept of metaphors can, for example, be used to Africanise the interface of the Telegram app in the following ways: 3.2.1 According to Thinyane, Gavaza and Terzoli (2011), the menu metaphor could be replaced by a basket metaphor to facilitate more intuitive usage for African users.✓ However, a picture of a basket is already used by Telegram to indicate the delete function.✓ 3.2.2 One could consider replacing the image of a basket for the delete function with another metaphor that could be more intuitive for rural African users, especially if the basket metaphor is adopted for the menu icon.✓ One of the following litter emoji’s can be considered after asking the local community if it would work better than the current trashcan that looks like a basket:✓ 10 INF3720/203/1/2021 ✓ 3.2.3 The “People Nearby” icon (a picture of a person in a circle) could be replaced by a picture of a few rondavels/traditional huts to indicate a rural African’s immediate environment and community.✓ QUESTION 4 – CHAPTER 5: SOCIAL INTERACTION (20) 4.1 Evaluate the current version of Telegram from the perspective of social interaction within the ITS environment (e.g., communication between tutors and students). Refer to people’s social disposition, the ideal of face-to-face conversations and the challenges in this regard for distance education, especially during the Covid-19 lockdown. Also discuss remote conversations and co-presence with reference to Telegram. (10) [p. 135-157] 4.2 Write a proposal to the CIO of ITS about ways that social engagement can be localised in a new version of the app. (10) [p. 158-161] MODEL ANSWER THEORY [p. 135-157] APPLICATION 4.1.1 People’s social disposition: people have evolved to be social. Communication technologies assist people to be social even if they are not physically in each other’s presence.✓ Telegram can be used to facilitate social engagement between ITS’s tutors and students. It does not only allow text messages but also one-to-one voice and video calls, as well as group meetings via its Voice Chat feature (https://www.howtogeek.com/711744/how- to-make-a-voice-or-video-call-on-telegram/). It should be investigated if meetings with video are possible and needed – lack of this function could be a deal-breaker.✓ 4.1.2 In person, face-to-face conversations are ideal since it allows participants to read body language and other explicit or implicit cues that are not always audible or visible on screen. It also allows one to immediately correct a statement if you realise that you have been misunderstood.✓ Due to ITS’s business model, in-person conversations are not possible. It seems that Telegram currently does not allow face-to- face video group meetings. If this is a non- negotiable requirement for ITS’s tutors and students, the app should be adapted or a new app should be created.✓ 4.1.3 Challenges for distance education during the Covid-19 lockdown: Group learning is more difficult in distance education since there is not a class of people present in one venue at the same time. During the lockdown, even smaller, informal study groups became impossible in the physical world.✓ If the Telegram app cannot facilitate online group meetings with video, ITS can amend its technology by using Zoom or Teams, since this will allow tutors to share the Powerpoint presentations on-screen, and the participants to see each other and collaborate in a more natural environment.✓ Or the app should be amended to include these functions. 4.1.4 Remote conversations are synchronous discussions over a distance that are facilitated by technologies such as the ITS’s tutors should schedule online weekly seminars with their students. Remote conversation technology that allows sound 11 INF3720/203/1/2021 telephone (audio) and video calls. Some people behave differently during in-person and remote conversations.✓ and video is needed to share slides and other visual course material. Being able to see each other will also build the class’s team spirit.✓ 4.1.5 Co-presence refers to technologies that support collaboration between people who are working in the same physical space.✓ Co-presence collaboration between students is not a viable option for ITS due to its distance education model. However, ITS should consider the possibility to combine remote conversations with co-presence technology to simulate group work in laboratories. New technology may have to be developed to make this possible.✓ 4.2 Proposal to the CIO of ITS about ways that social engagement can be localised in a new version of the app [p. 158-161]. [10] THEORY APPLICATION 4.2.1 “Social engagement refers to participation in the activities of a social group” (p. 158). It allows the exchange of ideas; helping others in need – thus promoting social cohesion.✓ Online discussion classes can promote the social cohesion of the group of students enrolled in a module, or doing a groupwork assignment. Members of a specific cultural group may do a groupwork assignment suggesting ways in which to Africanise/localise the content of the module syllabi.✓ 4.2.2 Social engagement that is mediated by the Internet is often voluntary and unpaid.✓ While students should be warned against plagiarism, social engagement may help them to do quality assurance of their assignment answers. Buying model answers on the internet should be discouraged since copied answers will be awarded zero marks, and students may be referred for disciplinary action. Diverse ethical systems should be discussed with reference to ITS’s requirements of honesty.✓ 4.2.3 It connects people with common interest.✓ Study groups of students who share the same study focus (e.g., a specific cultural group) can easily be formed, while intercultural collaboration should also be facilitated.✓ 4.2.4 Warning other people of imminent dangers such as storms/disasters✓ Social engagement technology can be used to quickly disseminate course-related information, e.g., if a submission deadline has been extended. Local issues such as sharing transport to a local study event can easily be shared online in a Telegram group.✓ 4.2.5 The problem of fake news – difficult to distinguish between valid news and hearsay.✓ Tutors and lecturers should be allowed access to students’ Telegram groups to correct any fake news that is being disseminated.✓ 12 INF3720/203/1/2021 QUESTION 5 – CHAPTER 6: EMOTIONAL INTERACTION (20) Do an emotional interaction evaluation of the current version of Telegram. Please refer to the following aspects and suggest ways to Africanise the app in this regard: 5.1 How was the interface of the current version of Telegram designed to make customers respond in certain ways? How do these designs resonate with African users? (3) [p. 182-186] 5.2 Do you think the current interface is believable and trustworthy, and why? (3) [p. 7, 24, 26, 41, 91, 190] 5.3 Are there any annoying interface elements that could cause users to stop using the app? Motivate your answer. (3) [p. 174-179] 5.4 Is the current version of Telegram aesthetically pleasing for African users? Motivate your answer. (3) [p. 173] 5.5 Which technology(-ies) can be used by the app’s owning company to detect users’ emotional states? Explain your answer. (3) [p. 179-182] 5.6 How could the app be tailored to create a more pleasurable experience for African users? [5] MODEL ANSWER THEORY APPLICATION 5.1 Persuasive technologies [p. 182-187], such as pop-up advertisements and warnings, are used to entice users to behave in a certain way.✓ It may be used to benefit someone’s wellbeing or to sensitise users to save electricity to limit CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic characteristics may help people to enjoy and accept digital technologies such as robots.✓ The current version of Telegram is designed to make it enticing for users to reply to messages. Users are not given an opportunity to review a message after tapping the send icon. However, all over, the interface is very neutral.✓ 5.2 A secure interface that ensures privacy will enhance an app’s trustworthiness [cf. p. 7, 91]. Sneaky/deceptive approaches to lure customers into unplanned actions can diminish trust [p. 24]. People should be nudged “in subtle and pleasant ways” to enhance trust [p. 26].✓ Fair and ethical design [p. 26], externalising reminders to reduce memory load [p. 129], interactive products that allow users to discuss its believability [p. 190]✓ all enhance trust. The current Telegram interface is believable and trustworthy since it does not contain any deceptive approaches to change its users’ behaviour and allows users to discuss its believability on the messaging app itself.✓ 5.3 Frustrating, annoying or patronising interfaces can make users angry and despondent,✓ as well as: irksome, trying, complex, non-intuitive, childish, intrusive, distracting, insulting, ineffective or inefficient interfaces; vague error messages; insufficient feedback; etc.✓ – see p. 176- 177. [p. 174-179] (3) Are there any annoying interface elements that could cause users to stop using the app? Yes, if a user has many contacts, there is no easy way to scroll to a contact name towards the middle or end of the alphabet, and this can get frustrating quickly.✓ 5.4 Well-designed animated icons, sound effects and vibrotactile feedback can be aesthetically pleasing for users✓ [p. 173]. Choice of colours, use of clean lines, simplicity, etc., are important.✓ Is the current version of Telegram aesthetically pleasing for African users? The interface is very bland and neutral and will probably be acceptable for most African users. However, African art could be used to 13 INF3720/203/1/2021 amend icons, patterns and colour combinations to make local users feel more at home.✓ 5.5 Cameras, biosensors, sound evaluation, body movement detectors, eye trackers,✓ etc., can be used to measure and analyse users’ emotional states based on their physical reactions.✓ [p. 179-182] Which technology(-ies) can be used by the app’s owning company to detect users’ emotional states? Telegram can use the cellphone’s built-in camera and audio recording function to measure users’ reactions to its interface provided that the users gave permission to switch on the surveillance function.✓ 5.6 Note: allow marks for other examples that are not necessarily based on Thinyane et al. (2011). How could the app be tailored to create a more pleasurable experience for African users? (5) • Using typical African artefacts as metaphors, e.g., baskets instead of tabs for menus: “In particular metaphors that underpin GUIs may need to be contextualised so they are intuitive to users from each culture” (Thinyane et al., 2011, p. 6).✓ • Positioning of such a basket metaphor, e.g., at the top to simulate the usual top shelf where baskets are put for storing items (cf. Thinyane et al., 2011, p. 11).✓ • Baskets should allow a preview of their contents (cf. Thinyane et al., 2011, p. 11).✓ • A text-to-speech facility that assists illiterate/semi-literate users (cf. Thinyane et al., 2011, p. 12)/Automated translations into local languages.✓ • Combining the current Telegram interface with a localised interface (cf. Thinyane et al., 2011, p. 10).✓ • Using local African patterns and colour combinations in the aesthetic design. 2.2 Assignment 02 1. b 2. c 3. d 4. a 5. a 6. d 7. c 14 INF3720/203/1/2021 8. b 9. d 10. a 11. b 12. c 13. c 14. a 15. d 16. b 17. c 18. d 19. b 20. a 2.3 Assignment 3 Total marks: 60 (100%) CASE STUDY: USER EXPERIENCE OF TELEGRAM For this assignment you should use the Telegram messaging app that is downloadable for free on all major platforms (https://telegram.org/). The case study following below is hypothetical. Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) is a private tutoring company in South Africa that provides tutoring services to students who are enrolled for diplomas and degrees in Information Systems at various colleges and universities. In the past, ITS’s tutors have been using WhatsApp to communicate with their students, but the company has decided to consider other options due to concerns about WhatsApp’s new terms and conditions that will be implemented in 2021. ITS considers three alternatives: • Switching to Telegram (as is) as an alternative messaging app • Developing its own Africanised messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients • Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localise the app for the South African market Assume that you have been appointed by Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) as an HCI expert. Management has tasked you to do a user experience evaluation of Telegram as a possible alternative. If ITS decides to adopt Telegram, you will have to manage all aspects of interaction design (ID) related to the current version of the product and possible future enhancements or alternatives planned for the South African market. IMPORTANT NOTE ON PLAGIARISM Please note that all exam scripts will be put through a plagiarism checking tool. Scripts with a high similarity index will receive a zero mark. You are not allowed to copy any text from the textbook or slides; other students’ notes or answers; templates, memos or model answers from any previous assignments, online tutors, the internet or any other sources. All questions must be answered in your own, original words. 15 INF3720/203/1/2021 QUESTION 1 – CHAPTER 8: DATA GATHERING (20) 1.1 Discuss the five key issues that any data gathering session requires in order to be successful. (5) [p. 260-266] 1.2 Apply these principles to the ITS case study, assuming that the CIO asked you to design a data gathering strategy to develop an Africanised version of the app. (5) [p. 260-266]. 1.3 Tsey (2010) used a local Ghanian custom of moderating narrative accounts repeatedly to gain maturity and consensus in empirical data [Tsey, K. 2010. Making Social Science Matter? Case Studies from Community Development and Empowerment Education Research in Rural Ghana and Aboriginal Australia. Asian Social Science 6, 2001: 3-12. https://doi.org/10.5539/ass.v6n1p3]. This approach could be regarded as an Africanised alternative to unstructured interviews or focus groups. A copy of Tsey’s paper is available on Additional Resources (Assignment 2). Read the paper and explain to the CIO how diverse South African customs can be used similarly for data gathering to guide the Africanisation of the Telegram app. (10) ANSWER GUIDELINES/EXAMPLES NOTE: For the purposes of this assignment, we will refer to the case study options stated above as follows: • Adopt: Switching to Telegram (as is) as an alternative messaging app • Adapt: Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localise the app for the South African market • Build: Developing its own Africanised messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients THEORY APPLICATION: HCI-related comments and questions to be considered by the ITS CIO to guide the Exco on the decision to adopt, adapt or build 1.1 Five key issues that any data gathering session requires in order to be successful [p. 260-266] 1.2 Application A data gathering strategy to develop an Africanised version of the Telegram app [p. 260-266] Setting goals: clear goals for research helps researchers to identify the most applicable types and techniques of data gathering.✓ The goal of this research is to gather information to guide the development of an Africanised version of Telegram.✓ Identifying participants: the study population should be selected using an applicable sampling method that facilitates meeting the research goal.✓ Saturation/convenience/snowball sampling; probability and non-probability methods. Non-probability sampling will work best for ITS, using tutors (convenience sampling) and students volunteering to participate (volunteer panels).✓ Relationship with participants: a professional relationship must be maintained between researchers and participants (who have to sign an informed consent form). Research data should be kept confidential and secure. Participation should be voluntary.✓ ITS should provide an informed consent to tutors and participating students informing them of the purpose and approach of the research and that no incentives will be paid.✓ Triangulation: the quality of research is ensured by using different data sources, various researchers, diverse theoretical models and different data gathering techniques (e.g., qualitative and quantitative data gathering approaches). ✓ ITS can use a smaller group of tutors for qualitative input regarding the design of the revised app, and quantitative questionnaires to confirm the provisional finding amongst large numbers of students.✓ Pilot study: “a small trial run of the main study” to test the viability of the planned ITS should first run a pilot study using one module’s tutor and only the students 16 INF3720/203/1/2021 methodology.✓ enrolled in that module. Based on their feedback, the methodology can be improved before rolling it out to the whole study population. ✓ 1.3 How diverse South African customs can be used for data gathering to guide the Africanisation of the Telegram app. A few principles borrowed from Tsey (2010) and other sources: • HCI knowledge should be enriched on three levels from an African perspective: epistemology, technical knowledge, and reflexive analysis regarding the values and interests that are built into scientific paradigms and theories (p. 5, 9).✓ • Research should not only be rigorous but also be relevant. Therefore, local needs and challenges should be addressed, and the community could be involved using a community engagement approach such as participatory action research (p. 6, 7).✓ • Local customs of data gathering and evaluation should be respected, e.g., local ways of story-telling (p. 7). Community leaders should be asked for permission to involve community members in the research, to record data, etc.✓ • “I learnt the importance of narrative, the human propensity to share stories of human diversity and unity, as fundamental to working with people to tackle difficult and sensitive cultural beliefs and attitudes. I sought to develop facilitation techniques that create safe environments for respectful but critical dialogue between diverse groups with unequal positions of power and influence” (Tsey, 2010:7). • Appreciate a community’s own strengths (“pockets of strengths, resilience and creativity”) as a basis of hope and confidence to improve its future.✓ • A holistic approach that focuses on physical and mental aspects of the research participants could enhance a research project’s success rate (p. 9). ✓ • “With reference to the IS discipline, the principle of Africanisation can be applied, for example, by including and integrating African traditions to inform the theory and practice of IS as an approach to decolonise computing (Ali 2016). One wonders how systems analysis design, business process management and joint application development approaches could be enriched and adapted by integrating the principles and customs of conventional African decision-making processes such as indabas, imbizos, lekgotlas and bosberade (see https://gqom.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/how-sae-words-for-meetings-of-people-have-gained-new-meanings- in-the-21st-century-imbizo-indaba-lekgotla/ for the differences between these types of meetings). In fact, one of the high-level capabilities in the IS2010 curriculum points precisely in this direction: ‘Customize [organisational] processes to address cultural and ethnic needs’ (Topi et al. 2010:17).” (Kroeze, 2019:45) [Kroeze, Jan. (2019). A Framework for the Africanisation of the Information Systems Discipline. 10.29086/2519-5476/2019/sp28.4a2.] • Further reading: Khupe, C. & Keane, M. (2017). Towards an African Education Research Methodology: Decolonising New Knowledge. Educational Research for Social Change, 6(1), 25-37. http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2221- 4070/2017/v6i1a3 Application to ITS-Telegram case study: • Students could refer to applicable customs in any of the diverse cultures in South Africa and suggest ways in which procedures of data recording, interviews, questionnaires or observations should be adapted to ensure a relationship of trust between the ITS researchers and the tutor and students participating in the project (pp. 266-300). (See p. 301 for an overview of data gathering techniques.).✓ • ITS can arrange an online indaba with its tutors and students to discuss the suitability of the current version of Telegram for e-tutoring and related communication. “However, while imbizo implies some form of consultation, an indaba has more of an element of a think-tank about it. (We might thus think about an imbizo as being more outward-looking, and an indaba more inward-looking, though in their contemporary senses the two can be used 17 INF3720/203/1/2021 interchangeably.)” (https://gqom.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/how-sae-words-for-meetings-of-people-have- gained-new-meanings-in-the-21st-century-imbizo-indaba-lekgotla/)✓ • How can local cultural constructs be embedded in a revised form or interface of the Telegram app, e.g. how can menu icons be localised?✓ • What indigenous knowledge regarding the essence of knowledge and understanding can be used to enrich the content of the Information Systems syllabus in terms of its understanding of data, information, knowledge and wisdom?✓ • How can students share their knowledge learned at ITS with their local communities – how can the app be extended to include a community engagement function?✓ QUESTION 2 – CHAPTER 11: DISCOVERING REQUIREMENTS (10) Assume that the management of the owning company of Telegram has decided to create an Africanised version of the app for the South African market. 2.1 Discuss five common types of requirements discovery. (5) [p. 398-414] 2.2 Reflect on these principles from the context of the Africanisation project to ensure that all salient aspects will be included in the design of the requirements discovery project. (5) ANSWER GUIDELINES [See pp. 398-414]: At least two of: 2.1 • Using probes to engage with users: cultural/design/technology/provocative✓ • Contextual inquiry: one-on-one field interviews/apprenticeship model/cool concepts: joy of life/use✓ • Brainstorming for innovation: wide range of participants allowing wild ideas✓ • Personas: rich descriptions of typical users✓ • Scenarios: informal narrative descriptions describing typical human activities related to a specific activity using tailor-made software✓ 2.2 • Probes: a provocative probe can be used to challenge existing message apps’ functionalities, e.g., can one assume that students always have access to the internet to use Telegram? (cf. p. 399)✓ • Contextual inquiry: contextual interviews can be conducted with students in their study environment to gain a better understanding of how often they use WhatsApp/Telegram when doing assignments and preparing for summative assessments (cf. p. 400).✓ • Brainstorming: ITS can arrange an online brainstorming session with all its tutors to get feedback from their side in terms of the limitations of the current messaging app being used, as well as opportunities for ITS to improve on these✓ • Personas: a rich description of the typical ITS student can be compiled and then sent out to all students to comment and amend✓ • Scenarios: an informal narrative can be used to describe a typical student action, e.g., a student who does an assignment needs to find the question paper, download it, read the relevant sections in the textbook, answer the questions, and submit the script. During alll these steps she can ask fellow students and tutors for advice.✓ QUESTION 3 – CHAPTER 14: INTRODUCING EVALUATION (10) Explain to the CIO how the first version of the proposed Africanised version can be evaluated after the core functionalities have been implemented. 3.1 Discuss various options of evaluation types briefly. (5) [p. 500-507] 18 INF3720/203/1/2021 3.2 Choose one or more suitable evaluation type, and motivate your choice(s) with reference to the first version of the proposed Africanised version of Telegram. (5) ANSWER GUIDELINES: 3.1 Evaluation types [see pp. 500-507]: • Controlled settings directly involving users, e.g., using usability labs for usability testing – test, measure, observe✓ • Natural settings involving users: used for field studies – help identify opportunities for new technology/requirements for a new design/introduction of new technology✓ • Settings not directly involving users: consultants and researchers critique a product✓ • Selecting and combining technologies: overcome pros and cons of single methods✓ • Opportunistic evaluation: early, informal to judge if it is worthwhile to proceed with an idea✓ 3.2 I have decided to use observation in a field study✓ to evaluate the first version of the proposed Africanised version after the core functionalities have been implemented. Observing how students use the revised version of Telegram in their natural settings will help me to identify areas which cause confusion.✓ These should either be improved or discussed in training during deployment. I will get students’ informed consent to record (audio and video)✓ of the interactions with the new version for in-depth analysis of the human-computer interaction, usability and user experience. For best results, I will follow an in-the-wild approach to see how students interact with the app in their private study space at home.✓ During Covid lockdowns, home visits can be replaced with Zoom video meetings. A virtual field study could also be used by monitoring students’ interactions with each other and their tutors while doing an assignment with their informed consent.✓ 19 INF3720/203/1/2021 QUESTION 4 – CHAPTER 15: EVALUATION STUDIES: FROM CONTROLLED TO NATURAL SETTINGS (10) Scrutinize the case study on testing the iPad’s usability on pp. 528-533 (15.2.3) of the textbook (5th edition) to find ideas for an evaluation study of the Africanised version of the Telegram app. Write a memo to the CIO explaining how the same principles can be used and adjusted for the Telegram evaluation study. Also explain to the CIO what the possible outcomes of such a study could be (i.e., what you foresee to learn from the exercise). You may also refer to other relevant theoretical concepts and how these could be implemented. (10) ANSWER GUIDELINES: [See pp. pp. 528-533 (15.2.3)] Principles extracted from the iPad case study: • An initial usability study should be followed up with a second study to a examine additional issues✓ • A think-aloud technique is useful to gain insight in users’ first impressions of a new tool or app✓ • Usability tests should ideally be replicated in different places or cultural settings to triangulate the results✓ • Participants should be typical users representing the actual target market✓ • If the study is done in a laboratory, the necessary equipment should be provided and prepared✓ • The raw research data should be interpreted and presented to management and the development team • A follow-up study should include users who had time to get used to the app’s human-computer interface • Do not take any method as granted when working with participants from diverse cultural groups How the same principles can be used and adjusted for the Telegram evaluation study: Test the revised Telegram app with a small group of tutors and students, and follow it up with a wider group.✓ Equip a laboratory in the main admin building where ITS students’ think aloud sessions can be recorded.✓ Duplicate the think-aloud sessions on other ITS campuses or using online, recorded Zoom sessions.✓ Select participants from all age, gender and race groups that reflect the ITS student body.✓ Analyse the raw research data and present problems with the software and suggested solutions to the ITS CIO and development team.✓ What the possible outcomes of the study could be (i.e., what I foresee to learn from the exercise): The outcome of the usability testing will provide information on the ease of use, time to carry out certain tasks, how many errors users make. The Unisa eye-tracking lab can be used to determine of the layout of the revised app afford users to find the next step of a procedure easily. Other relevant theoretical concepts and how these could be implemented: Alternatively, students could discuss and apply conducting experiments and field studies. 20 INF3720/203/1/2021 QUESTION 5 – CHAPTER 16: EVALUATION: INSPECTIONS, ANALYTICS AND MODELS (10) 5.1 List and explain (in your own words) any five of Nielsen’s revised set of heuristics for HCI evaluation. (5) [p. 550-551] 5.2 Mention five aspects of the current version of the Telegram app that could be evaluated using each of the usability principles explained in 5.1 (align each heuristic with one aspect). Motivate why the heuristic is relevant for the evaluation of this specific aspect. (5) ANSWER GUIDELINES: [See pp. 550-551] Any five of: Heuristics (5) Telegram aspects that could be evaluated plus motivation (5) 1. Heuristic 1: Visibility of system status, e.g. giving quick and good feedback to the user after carrying out an action✓ How does the current version of Telegram give feedback to a student who has joined a new e-tutoring group?✓ 2. Heuristic 2: Match between system and real world: providing the same functionality as traditional, manual processes✓ Does Telegram provide the same functionality as traditional circulars sent to students (e.g., data on the ITS learning platform)?✓ 3. Heuristic 3: User control and freedom: allow users to undo mistakes✓ Does Telegram allow users to undo mistakes, for example, to delete a message that was sent to the wrong group?✓ 4. Heuristic 4: Consistency and standards: various functionalities follow the same platform conventions✓ Does the various Telegram functionalities follow the same platform conventions – are the same icons used in Invite Friend, and New Group? Why are these functions located in different menus?✓ 5. Heuristic 5: Error prevention: does the app check for error- prone conditions and prevent these?✓ Does Telegram check warn the student that she has already replied to the same question and ask if she would like to resend the message?✓ 6. Heuristic 6: Recognition rather than recall: providing instructions to use an app that are easy to find Are instructions/FAQs on how to use Telegram visible or easily retrievable? Is the interface intuitive use, or do you have to consult the user manual or the help function regularly? 7. Heuristic 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use: catering for experienced and unexperienced users and allowing ways to carry out actions faster How does Telegram cater for experienced and unexperienced users? Are there any shortcuts for experienced students? 8. Heuristic 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design: are there any dialogs that are irrelevant or rarely needed that diminish the relative visibility of essential dialogs? Are there any unnecessary functions in Telegram that diminish the relative visibility of essential dialogs? 9. Heuristic 9: Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors: Do error messages contain any Do Telegram error messages suggest steps to recover from an error? Are there any error messages...? 21 INF3720/203/1/2021 technospeak/computer jargon or are they formulated in plain language? 10. Heuristic 10: Help and documentation: Does the app provide extra documentation that is easy to find and not too large or complex (e.g., frequently asked questions) Does Telegram provide extra documentation that is easy to find and not too large or complex (e.g., advanced technical questions?) 2.4 Assignment 04 1. b 2. c 3. c 4. c 5. b 6. d 7. a 8. d 9. c 10. a 11. b 12. a 13. b 14. d 15. d 16. a 17. b 18. c 19. d 20. b 3 CONCLUSION If you would want to request a remark for Assignment 01, you need to do a self-evaluation first.
