For example, if you live in an area where the network connection is very bad, or you don't have a laptop and you feel it would be difficult to write the exam on a phone, etc, or any other reason that will result in a bad mark due to circumstances out of your control, it would be best for you to defer. Having said that, think before you just ask for deferment. If at all possible, write the exam in May/June. If you defer, you will have one or more additional exams in October, because you will also have your 2nd semester exams. | hope this clears up some of the confusion.
