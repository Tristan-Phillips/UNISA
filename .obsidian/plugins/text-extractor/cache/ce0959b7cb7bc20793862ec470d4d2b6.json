Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) is a private tutoring company in South Africa that provides tutoring services to students who are enrolled for diplomas and degrees in Information Systems at various colleges and universities. In the past, ITS’s tutors have been using WhatsApp to communicate with their students, but the company has decided to consider other options due to concerns about WhatsApp’s new terms and conditions that will be implemented in 2021. ITS considers the following alternatives: • Developing its own Africanised messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients • Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localise the app for the South African market Assume that you have been appointed by ITS as an HCI expert. Management has tasked you to do a user experience evaluation of Telegram as a possible alternative. ITS decides to adopt Telegram and you have to manage all aspects of interaction design (ID) related to the possible future enhancements or alternatives planned for the South African market. Question 2.1 (6) As an interaction designer, briefly describe interactive technologies that can be used to design the ITS app that is accessible and inclusive to meet the needs of the following group of users. Describe in point form the technologies per each group of users. Users Technology description Blind users (persons that cannot see) 1. Screen readers that read the text that is on the screen. It helps if the site has a good HTML structure and alternative text for pictures. Popups that do not set the focus properly can cause issues. 2. Refreshable braille displays are a flat keyboard-like device that allows the users to read text using their fingers. 3. Dictation is becoming increasing common even for users who can see but is obviously more useful for blind people. https://www.levelaccess.com/understanding-assistive-technology- how-does-a-blind-person-use-the-internet/ Deaf users (persons that cannot hear) Real-time captioning support / transcriptions is now possible (although not always accurate and allows deaf people to understand what has been said in videos / meetings) Visual / tactile alerts rather than auditory assist deaf people to know that there is an incoming call or a new message on their cell phone. Support for accessories that can connect to computers / cellphones https://clerccenter.gallaudet.edu/national-resources/info/info-to- go/assistive-technology/assistive-technologies.html Question 2.2 (15) There is a fine line between an interaction that works and that is usable. Designing interactions that work and are usable is achievable if design principles are appropriately applied. Discuss how you would apply the following principles when designing the ITS app. *Note: I did not give new ways to apply the principle, but mostly gave examples of how Telegram currently implements the principles. Principle Description (3 marks each) Visibility Make the functions that the user may possibly need highly visible on the interface. This indicates what can be done from the current state. Finding your tutors and being able to identify them should be apparent when signing up for the app and each time you sign in. Getting added to a group should be a once off process and then the groups that you belong to should be clearly identifiable. Feedback Feedback works best when there is an immediate result when performing an action or a notification indicating it cannot be done or has been completed successfully. Feedback that a message has been sent is indicated by a tick and when it has been read it is often indicated by two ticks. If there is no internet connection from your device, Telegram picks it up and notifies you to correct this before sending messages. Constraints Constraints refers to restricting a user to the actions that they can perform at any given time. Sometimes, the options should be hidden and sometimes they should be clearly marked as inaccessible (with a reason if possible). Constraints that could be added to the system is to restrict students from sending the tutor’s private / direct messages if this needs to be prevented. Also, if large attachments cannot be sent in the groups, then a message should pop up and explain that the attachment is too large and will not be sent. Consistency Consistency refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. In a way, messaging apps share consistency, so the similarities between WhatsApp and Telegram could be highlighted to users to make the switch easier. When using Telegram and on a group’s profile, it is very similar to when you view a user’s profile – the two are consistent. The way the different options under a groups profile work are also very similar to each other – showing consistency. Affordance Affordance means that an attribute of an object gives an indication to people as to how to use it. Affordance, very simply, means to give a clue. The search bar above the users and groups is close enough to let you know that you will be searching through users and groups. The magnifying glass also gives an affordance that you need to use that bar if you are looking for something. The search in the upper-right hand corner of the web UI is less clear about what it will search, but on hovering there is a tooltip that appears with the text “Search in this chat”. Pages 26-31. Question 2.3 (4) As an interaction designer for ITS, you would need to collect some requirements from the stakeholders. Identify four stakeholders and list them in the following table. Stakeholder 1 Students enrolled in ITS 2 Tutors employed at ITS 3 Owners of ITS (project funders) 4 Developers employed at ITS / used by ITS Telegram Question 2.4 (10) What is the importance of involving users during the design of ITS? Identify at least 5 valid points and record them in the table below. Description of the point (2 marks per valid point) 1 Developers gain a good understanding of the user’s goals, which leads to a more appropriate, more usable product. 2 User’s expectations are also managed as they see the iterations and functionality that is being developed before the product is released. 3 A sense of ownership is created when users’ feel that they contributed to a product’s development. 4 Design decisions are made within the context of the users, their activities and their environment, making a usable released product more likely. 5 Typical user characteristics are captured and designed for – including possible limitations with technology. Page 44 / 48. Question 2.5 (10) During the design of the ITS app, how would you manage the expectations and ownership of the product by the stakeholders? Provide your answer in point form in the table below. Point Description of the point (2 marks per valid point) 1 Involving the stakeholders throughout the design and development process. 2 Marketing should not overexaggerate the features of the product. 3 Show stakeholders the product’s capabilities at an early stage. 4 Have adequate and timely training for the stakeholders to manage their expectation. 5 Possibly release a prototype for the stakeholders to use before it is officially released so that their expectations are based on personal experience. Also 422. Foster a sense of ownership in the product by having stakeholders involved in the development process. Use a focus group to identify and resolve conflicts in expectations among the different stakeholders. 271. Use user stories to ensure that the requirements have been captured fully and meet thre stakeholders’ requirements. 388. Allow stakeholders to suggest ideas using a Wall Walk – a contextual design method in which the models are hung up on walls for the stakeholders to read and suggest ideas – this is another way to foster a sense of ownership. 401. Use scenarios and story boards to include stakeholders in the development to ensure their needs and requirements have been captured and to further foster a sense of development. 408. Page 44. Question 3 (19) Question 3.1 (2) What do you understand by the term \"emotional interaction\"? Emotional interaction is a broad term that includes both emotional design and affective computing. Affective computing is when the user’s emotions are sensed by the application and possibly interventions based on this – such as trying to cheer a user up or ask them to stop and reflect on what they are trying to do when they are becoming frustrated. Emotional design is when technology is designed with an attempt to engender desired emotional states. This way of designing is focused on how interactive products evoke certain kinds of emotional responses in people. Page 166. My understanding of it is that it focuses on creating pleasant emotions – calm, energised or entertained and avoid negative emotions such as anger and frustration. It also can record the emotional effect that the interactive experience has had. OR: Emotional interaction is concerned with what makes people feel happy, sad, annoyed, anxious, frustrated, motivated, delirious, and so on, and then using this knowledge to inform the design of different aspects of the user experience. Page 167. Question 3.2 (9) From the components of the Anthony Ortony et al. (2005) model of emotional design, briefly explain how a wrist watch designed for teenage girls will invoke each of the components of the model. Provide your answer in the following table. Component Explanation 1 Reflective (meaning and personal value of a product in a particular culture) – the cultural images and bright colours are / were typically fashionable to young users who wanted to stand out. 2 Behavioural (equates to the traditional values of usability) – it is a functional watch that people can use to tell the time. The watch uses the common layout of watches. 3 Visceral (making products look, feel, and sound good) – the watch has brilliant and bright colours and a variety of them. Pages 171-2. Question 3.3 (8) You want to buy the above watch for your teenager. Assume that the watch has sports functions, including measuring heart rate and recording sport activities. You are concerned about the usability of the watch. List any four usability questions that you would ask before buying the watch in the following table? Usability questions 1 How easy is it to access the heart rate information? 2 Can the information be uploaded to other devices? 3 How long does the watch store the history of the heart rate information? 4 How accurate is the heart rate information? How long does the battery last? How comfortable is the watch? Question 4 (6) Interviews can be viewed as a conversation with a purpose between two or more people where questions are asked by the interviewer to get facts or clarity from the interviewee. Interviews are mostly used for requirements gathering during product design or for testing the usability of a product. In point form, describe the characteristics of structured interviews and focus groups in the following table. Structured interview characteristics Focus group characteristics 1. Interviewer asks predetermined questions. 1. Can be considered a group interview 2. Similar to a questionnaire. 2. Normally, three to ten people are involved 3. Same questions are asked in the same order for every participant, so it is standardised. 3. Discussion is led by a trained facilitator 4. Short and clearly worded questions are better. 4. Participants are selected to be representative of the target population 5. Usually consists of closed questions. 5. Can be used to identify conflicts in expectation or terminology 6. Works well if the range of answers is known. 6. Diverse and sensitive issues may be raised 7. Works well if the participants do not have a lot of time. 7. More appropriate for shared issues than individual experiences 8. Suitable when the goals of the study are understood so that specific questions can be asked. 8. Has a predefined agenda 9. Is flexible, so that unanticipated issues can be raised 10. Can be adapted to fit local or cultural settings Page 269. Pages 271-2. Question 5 (10) Cognitive walkthroughs involve simulating a user’s problem-solving process at each step in the human computer dialog, checking to see if the user’s goals and memory can be assumed to lead to the next correct action. In point form, describe each of the five steps involved in cognitive walkthroughs. Description of cognitive walkthrough stage 1 Characteristics of typical users are identified. Sample tasks are developed. A description, mock-up or prototype is produced. A clear sequence of steps is created. 2 A designer and one or more UX researchers come together to do the analysis. 3 The UX researchers walk through the action sequences for each task, placing it within the context of the typical scenario. As they do this, they ask questions: will the next action be evident to the user? Will the user notice the correct action is available? Will the user interpret the response (from the system after the action) correctly? Will the users know what to do, see how to do it, and understand if they completed it correctly or not. 4 A record of critical information is compiled – assumptions that would cause problems, notes about side issues. A summary is made. 5 More tests are often done with real users to confirm results. The design is revised to fix the problems presented. Page 561-2.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
