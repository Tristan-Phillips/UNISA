Past examination papers have been placed on myUnisa for you to review/practice. Remember: you must be able to deﬁne concepts, or discuss them – not every question will be of a practical nature. Don’t make the mistake of only studying the operation of the algorithms: you must understand the theory and concepts relating to them as well. We are aware that many students make use of other books/videos/resources to supplement the prescribed book. They can be very valuable in understanding difﬁcult concepts and algorithms that are often not well explained or illustrated in Russell & Norvig. The problem is that there are differences between these sources in notation, terminology and deﬁnitions. For example, some books and videos describe a different version of the alpha/beta pruning algorithm where the alpha and beta values are updated before performing the cut test. In the prescribed book, the test is performed ﬁrst and the values are not updated if a cut occurs. Another example is the use and deﬁnition of terms like utility function, evaluation function, objective function and payoff function. If you have used other sources, you need to know if (and how) they differ from the prescribed book. 2 Writing the exam Plan your time when writing the paper. You have two hours to get 100 marks. There are 6 ques- tions, and all of them are compulsory. Take your time to determine which questions you are comfortable answering and answer them ﬁrst. Don’t worry about the order in which you answer questions in your script. However, please indicate clearly what answer goes with which question. We don’t mind looking around for an answer, but once we have to start hunting we may miss something. After you have answered the easy questions (the ones you know you know), answer the ones you are less sure of, and ﬁnally answer the difﬁcult ones. Keep an eye on your watch at all times, and make sure you stick to your plan. With reference to the matter of using alternative sources discussed above, if you want to give an answer in a notation, or use terminology or the deﬁnition of an algorithm that differs from that used in the prescribed book, you must state so with your answer. For example, if you use an alternative alpha/beta pruning algorithm, you need to write something like “Please note: I am using Neilsen’s alpha/beta pruning algorithm.” In the section below, when we specify sections that you may omit, it is because they aren’t covered in the syllabus. We wish all the best for your exams! COS3751 lecturer(s). 3 3 Outline of syllabus 3.1 Chapter 1: Introduction Read as background. 3.2 Chapter 2: Intelligent Agents Familiarise yourself with the concepts and terminology. Make sure you can deﬁne the concepts in this chapter, and apply the deﬁnitions in different scenarios. 3.3 Chapter 3: Solving Problems by Searching Study everything. You have to be able to formally deﬁne problems and apply the different unin- formed search strategies to these deﬁned problems. Thus you have to understand all the algo- rithms and be able to apply them to a given problem statement. You do not need to memorise any pseudo-code. You can omit entirely: Section 5.3: Memory- bounded heuristic search. 3.4 Chapter 4: Beyond Classical Search Study everything except the following sections, which you can omit entirely: 1. Section 2: Local Search in Continuous Spaces 2. Section 5: Online Search Agents and Unknown Environments You have to understand all the algorithms and be able to apply them to a given problem statement. You do not need to memorise any pseudo-code. 3.5 Chapter 5: Adversarial Search Study sections 1, 2 and 3. You have to understand the minimax and alpha-beta algorithms, and be able to apply them to a given problem statement. Read sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. You have to understand the concepts covered in these sections, but you do not need to be familiar with any particular game such as backgammon, chess or any card game. 3.6 Chapter 6: Constraint Satisfaction Problems Study everything except the following section, which you can omit entirely: Section 5: The Structure of Problems. You have to understand all the algorithms and be able to apply them to a given problem statement. You do not need to memorise any pseudo-code. 4 COS3751/105 3.7 Chapter 7: Logical Agents Study everything. Many of the concepts introduced in this chapter should already be familiar to you from COS2661. However, there are some important algorithms in this chapter that you will probably not be familiar with. In particular, you have to understand and be able to apply forward and backward chaining as well as resolution. You also have to be able to use a resolution refutation to prove a certain statement. Agents based on propositional logic are important. You may omit the DPLL and WALKSAT algorithms, and you may also omit section 6: Effective Propositional Model Checking. 3.8 Chapter 8: First-Order Logic Study everything, but you may omit section 4: Knowledge Engineering in First-Order Logic. 3.9 Chapter 9: Inference in First-Order Logic Study only sections 1, 2, 3, 4.1, and 5. You do not have to familiarize yourself with Prolog. 3.10 Chapter 18: Learning from Examples Understand the forms of learning and the concepts of supervised learning. You have to be able to construct a decision tree and reason with the contents thereof. You can omit sections 4 to 11. Make sure that you understand the solutions to the self-assessment assignment provided in Tutorial Letter 203. Copyright c⃝UNISA 2018 (v2018.1.1) 5","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
