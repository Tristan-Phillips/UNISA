For more detail study, we have included Chapter 10 (Database Development Process) and Chapter 11 (Conceptual, Logical and Physical Database design); of the previous edition as well. These two chapters explained database design in great detail. This assignment also requires you to apply some concepts you learnt in Database 1 (INF2606). For example your knowledge of Chapter 2 (Data Model) and Chapter 3 (Relational Model Characteristics) To do this assignment, we recommend you study chapters 10, 11 and 12 (particularly Chapter 10 and 11) of your recommended textbook in detail as the textbook explains database design in great detail (recommended book: Coronel, C., Morris, S., Rob, P., and Crockett, K. 2013. Database Principles: Fundamentals of Design, Implementation, and Management (2nd edition). Cengage Learning. ISBN-13: 978-1-4080-4863-4 and ISBN-10: 1-4080-4863-9). The chapters will be made available to INF3703 students via additional resources. Objective(s) This assignment will help you gain some practical experience in designing a database. However due to time limitation: We have received very good constructive feedbacks from students in the last academic year on how we can improve this assignment. We are working on how we can accommodate the constructive comments. The most common issue we picked up at this stage is “time limitation”. To accommodate students’ suggestions, we have decided to allow students to discuss the assignment in-group but each person will submit their own unique assignment. However should you prefer not to discuss the assignment with other students, you are welcome to do so. This will assist students in addressing time factor challenge, as students would discuss the different part of the assignment, which we believe, will enhance their understanding. Another issue difficulty finding real-world case. For students struggling to get a real-world organisation/business to analyse and base their assignment on, you are allowed to base your database design on case studies. You will need to do some research and come up with a detailed description of an organisation/business and base your assignment on that. The detailed business descriptions need to be made available on your final report. NB: Whichever case you decide (Using a real-world or case based organisation/business, you must provide a clear description of the organisation in your assignment. Extra 5 marks will be given to students that put extra effort to find real-world organisations, schools, business, or NGOs. The reason for this is that the assignment is designed to make students gain a real-world experience for instance how to generate business requirement, etc. Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 The assignment would not require you to implement, test, operate and maintain the database you developed. Nevertheless, should you which to do so, it is between you and the business/organisation you used for your assignment as it is beyond the scope of this module. If you take a step forward implementing the designed database, you will be giving back to your community by adding value to the organisation/business. Expected outcome At the end of this assignment, you should produce a report with a minimum of 15 pages and a maximum of 20 pages, containing descriptions and explanations of all the activities you carried out with your chosen organisation (real-world or case-based) to obtain the design models (Conceptual, Logical and Physical) of database addressing the issue identified. Important note: - Students should follow the structure of the rubric when doing the final report – it quite time consuming to search unstructured assignments for possible marks to be awarded. Some marks will be taken from students who not follow the structure of the rubric. - Answers that are not legible (especially ERD’s) cannot receive marks - Base on our past marking experience, most students have no idea what the difference is between conceptual, logical and physical design. In addition to your prescribed textbook, you need to study the two chapters of the textbook made available under additional resources to understand clearly the differences between the three stages of database design.
