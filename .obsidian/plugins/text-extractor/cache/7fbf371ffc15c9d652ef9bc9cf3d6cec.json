Answer all questions. 2. Write neatly and legibly. 3. The table in the appendix is provided to help during your entropy and information gain calculations. 4. This paper consists of 6 pages including Appendix A (page 6). [TURN PAGE] 2 COS3751 May/June 2017 Question 1 State Spaces [9] (a) Deﬁne the concept of a Fully Observable environment. (3) (b) Consider a game of chess. Is this a deterministic or stochastic environment? Clearly explain why. (2) (c) Differentiate between discrete and continuous environments. Provide an example of each. (4) Question 2 Searching [23] (a) Consider the diagram shown in Figure 1 below and answer the questions that follow (the ˆh value of each node is provided in brackets after the node name, and the ˆg value is provided next to the edges between nodes): S (10) B(4) E (1) F (1) C(6) M(2) K(1) G(0) H(1) J(1) D(7) I(5) 2 4 2 5 3 1 1 2 1 2 5 Figure 1: State Space i. Explain what an admissible heuristic is. (2) ii. Based on observation, is the heuristic employed in the ﬁgure admissible? Clearly explain your answer. (3) iii. Perform an A∗ search on the state space provided in Figure 1, to ﬁnd a solution path from the start state to a goal state. Keep the following in mind when answering this question: 1. You only need to show the ﬁrst 5 steps (step 1 has already been completed for you; you don’t have to ﬁnd the solution). [TURN PAGE] 3 COS3751 May/June 2017 2. In your answer, show the contents of the frontier after each step, as well as the ˆg, ˆh and ˆf values for every expanded node. The name of each node appears inside the node (in Figure 1). 3. You only need to show the new nodes added to the frontier after each step; don’t rewrite the entire frontier at each step. 4. When two ˆf values are the same, always choose the node with the name that is ﬁrst alphabetically for expansion. The following table provides the structure you should use in your answer (the ﬁrst step has been provided). (11) Step Expanded Frontier (n(ˆh, ˆg, ˆf )) 1 S(10, 0, 10) 2 . . . . . . (b) Consider the diagram provided in Figure 2 below. A B C D E F G H I J K L M Figure 2: Depth First Search Assume that loops are detected, that is, already expanded nodes will not be expanded again. Nodes are generated in the the order Down, Right, Up, and Left. For example, if node F is expanded, nodes are generated: B (Down), and I (Up), and E (Left). Take note that there are no nodes right of F . Diagonal moves are not permitted. i. Suppose the start node is node M , and the goal node is node G. List the ﬁrst 4 nodes (after M ) in the order they are generated for a non-recursive based depth- ﬁrst search. (4) ii. Does the search above discover an optimal solution to the problem? Justify your answer. (3) [TURN PAGE] 4 COS3751 May/June 2017 Question 3 Adversarial Search [12] Consider the game tree in Figure 3 and then answer the questions that follow (the static utility values for the leaf nodes are provided below each leaf node). A B D E C F I M N J G K L H 7 9 4 11 9 11 12 8 Figure 3: Adversarial Search Tree (a) Suppose a Minimax search is performed on the tree. Provide the min-max values for nodes A, B, C, and F . (4) (b) Suppose a Minimax search with Alpha/Beta pruning is done in a left-to-right fashion on the tree. Provide the α and β values for nodes A, B, C, and F which would have been recorded during the search (the values when the search terminates). (8) Question 4 Constraint Satisfaction Problems [16] Consider the following crypt-arithmetic puzzle: S E N D + M O R E M O N E Y The puzzle can be rewritten as a CSP. Answer the questions below. (a) Deﬁne the variables for this puzzle (include all possible variables that are used). (6) (b) Deﬁne the domain for each variable. Be as speciﬁc as possible. (4) (c) Provide the constraints for this problem. (6) [TURN PAGE] 5 COS3751 May/June 2017 Question 5 Predicate Logic [20] (a) Convert the following propositional sentence to Conjunctive Normal Form: (P ⇒ Q) ⇒ (¬R ⇒ (S ∧ T )) (10) (b) Closely examine the following propositional sentences in a knowledge base ρ. 1 ¬A ∨ ¬B ∨ ¬C ∨ D 2 ¬D ∨ ¬F ∨ G 3 ¬G ∨ ¬H ∨ I 4 ¬A ∨ ¬H ∨ C 5 ¬A ∨ B 6 A 7 H 8 F Show that ρ |= I using forward chaining. (10) Question 6 Learning from Examples [20] Consider the following data in Table 1, comprised of three binary input attributes (A1, A2, and A3), and one binary output y: Example A1 A2 A3 y x1 1 0 0 0 x2 1 0 1 0 x3 0 1 0 0 x4 1 1 1 1 x5 1 1 0 1 Table 1: Data set (a) Using the principles of Information Gain build a decision tree for the data. Show the computations made to determine the attribute to split at each node. Use the table on page 6 for the entropy calculations. Also show the decision tree: branch and leaf nodes, as well as edges and appropriate labels for the edges.
