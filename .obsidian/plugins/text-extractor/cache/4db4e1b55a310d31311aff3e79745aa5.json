(ii) Model M where the sentence is false: A: set of people R M : We interpret R(x, y) as x is father of y etc QUESTION 7 Question 7(a) To be true in the model, a formula has to be true in all four worlds. An example is □ (p  q) a: □ (p  q) is true in a because p  q is true in the only world accessible from a, namely d. b: □ (p  q) is true in b because p  q is true in every world (namely a, c and d) accessible from b. c: □ (p  q) is true in c because p  q is true in b, the only world accessible from c. d: □ (p  q) is true in d because p  q is true in b, the only accessible world from d. To be valid, a modal formula has to be true in every world of every model. The formula □ (p  q) is not valid because it is for example not true in world a of the following model: a b p COS3761 October 2015 Page 7 Question 7(b) (i) Yes. For □ □ p to be true in world a, □ p has to be true in all worlds accessible from a namely d. Since p is true in all worlds accessible from d namely b. The relation does hold. (ii) Yes. For □ p  □  q to be true in world b, either □ p should be false in b or □  q should be true in b. We can see that □ p is false in b ,since p is not true in all the worlds accessible from b, in particular d.Thus the relation holds. QUESTION 8 (i) □    This is not valid. We can believe a statement to be true when it is false. In the case of a logic of belief we would not expect it to be valid.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
