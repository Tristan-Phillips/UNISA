Number of evaluators • Nielsen suggests that on average 5 evaluators identify 75-80% of usability problems. • Cockton and Woolrych (2001) point out that the number of users needed to find 75-80% of usability problems depends on the context and nature of the task problems. www.id-book.com 7 Heuristics for websites focus on key criteria (Budd, 2007) • Clarity • Minimize unnecessary complexity & cognitive load • Provide users with context • Promote positive & pleasurable user experience www.id-book.com 8 Doing heuristic evaluation • Briefing session to tell experts what to do. • Evaluation period of 1-2 hours in which: – Each expert works separately; – Take one pass to get a feel for the product; – Take a second pass to focus on specific features. • Debriefing session in which experts work together to prioritize problems. www.id-book.com 9 Advantages and problems • Few ethical & practical issues to consider because users not involved. • Can be difficult & expensive to find experts. • Best experts have knowledge of application domain & users. • Biggest problems: – Important problems may get missed; – Many trivial problems are often identified – ie false alarms; – Experts have biases. www.id-book.com 10 Turning design guidelines and golden rules into heuristics Ask questions like the following: “Does the application include a visible title page, section or site? Does the user always know where they are located? Does the user always know what the system or application is doing? Are the links clearly defined? Can all actions be visualized directly (i.e., no other actions are required)?” Granollers, 2018, p. 62 www.id-book.com 11 Evaluating for accessibility using Guidelines • Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) (see Lazar et al., 2015). • Guidelines can be used as heuristics for evaluating websites. • Governments and large corporations have to make their websites accessible by law. • Four key concepts: – Perceivable; – Operable; – Understandable; – Robust. https//www.w3.org/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance www.id-book.com 12 Cognitive walkthroughs • Focus on ease of learning. • Designer presents an aspect of the design & usage scenarios. • Expert is told the assumptions about user population, context of use, task details. • One or more experts walk through the design prototype with the scenario. • Experts are guided by 3 questions. www.id-book.com 13 The 3 questions • Will the correct action be sufficiently evident to the user? • Will the user notice that the correct action is available? • Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly? As the experts work through the scenario they note problems. www.id-book.com 14 Pluralistic walkthrough • Variation on the cognitive walkthrough theme. • Performed by a carefully managed team. • The panel of experts begins by working separately. • Then there is managed discussion that leads to agreed decisions. • The approach lends itself well to participatory design. • Also other adaptations of basic cognitive walkthroughs. www.id-book.com 15 Web Analytics • A form of interaction logging that analyzes users’ activities on website. • Designers use the analysis to improve their designs. • When designs don’t meet users’ needs they will not return to the site. • They become one-time users • Web analytics enable designers to track the activities of users on their site. • They can see how many people come to the site, how long they stay and where they go. • Web analytics offer designers the “big picture” about how their site performs based on user activity. • One of the most well-know analytics. www.id-book.com 16 Segment of Google Analytics for id-book.com, December 2018 www.id-book.com 17 Segment of Google Analytics for id-book.com, December 2018 www.id-book.com 18 Segment of early VisiStat Analytics from 2010 www.id-book.com 19 Source: http//www.visistat.com/tracking/monthly-page-views.php Segment of early VisiStat Analytics from 2010 www.id-book.com 20 Where visitors to Mountain Wineries in California come from. Source: http//www.visistat.com/tracking/monthly-page-views.php A/B Testing • A large-scale experiment. • Offers another way to evaluate a website, application of app running on a mobile device. • Often used for evaluating changes in design on social media applications. • Compares how two groups of users perform on two versions of a design. • Can involve thousands of users. • May create ethical dilemmas if users don’t know they are part of the test. • Care is needed to ensure that other issues are not affecting users’ behavior. www.id-book.com 21 Predictive models • Provide a way of evaluating products or designs without directly involving users. • Less expensive than user testing. • Usefulness limited to systems with predictable tasks - e.g., telephone answering systems, mobiles, cell and smart phones. • Based on expert error-free behavior. www.id-book.com 22 Fitts’ Law (Fitts, 1954) • Fitts’ Law predicts that the time to point at an object using a device is a function of the distance from the target object & the object’s size. • The further away and the smaller the object, the longer the time to locate it and point to it. • Particularly useful for determining where on a screen to position an object. • Fitts’ Law is useful for evaluating systems for which the time to locate an object is important, e.g., a cell and smart phones, a handheld and mobile devices. www.id-book.com 23 Key points • Inspections can be used to evaluate requirements, mockups, functional prototypes, or systems. • User testing & heuristic evaluation may reveal different usability problems. • Design guidelines can be used to develop heuristics. • Walkthroughs are fine-grained focused method for evaluating small parts of a product. • Analytics involves collecting data about users activity on a website or product to see which parts are used. • A/B testing a form of large-scale experiment. • Fitts’ Law can be used to predict expert, error-free performance for clearly defined tasks with limited key presses, eg to evaluate keypress sequences for handheld devices and the position of objects on a screen. www.id-book.com 24","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
