If there are no common values, then no rows are returned. Outer join returns rows from two or more tables where at least one column has common value, as well as rows where the join condition fails. Qualifiers are used to identify the table containing the referenced column. They must be used when more than one table contains the referenced column to avoid the ambiguity error. The difference between using clause and on clause is while joining two or more tables by using “using clause”, column name of both table must same via using which table is being joined whereas in case of “on clause” column name may differ.

The string returned is in the same character set as source_char. It returns VARCHAR2 if the first argument is not a LOB and returns CLOB if the first argument is a LOB. The REGEXP_INSTR function is used to return the location of a regular expression pattern in a string. This function allows you to find a substring in a string using regular expression pattern matching. If no match is found, then the function returns 0. The REGEXP_SUBSTR function use used to return the substring that matches a regular expression within a string. This function returns NULL when no matches are found. An empty string can be returned by this function if the regular expression matches a zero-length string.

An equal sign (=) is used as comparison operator in the where clause to refer equality. A self join is a join in which a table is joined with itself (which is also called Unary relationships), especially when the table has a FOREIGN KEY which references its own PRIMARY KEY. To join a table it means that each row of the table is combined with itself and with every other row of the table. The INNER JOIN selects all rows from both participating tables as long as there is a match between the columns. An SQL INNER JOIN is same as JOIN clause, combining rows from two or more tables. The SQL OUTER JOIN returns all rows from both the participating tables which satisfy the join condition along with rows which do not satisfy the join condition. The SQL OUTER JOIN operator (+) is used only on one side of the join condition only.
