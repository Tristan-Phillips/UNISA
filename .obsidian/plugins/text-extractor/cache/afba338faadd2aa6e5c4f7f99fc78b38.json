Keep Records No idea should be criticised or debated Sharpen focus User warmup exercises Include participants from wide range of disciplines Participants should know users’ goals that the product must support Don’t ban silly stuff Use catalysts for further inspiration Question 3: 3.1 Effectiveness: Ensuring the system is good at what it needs to do Efficiency: Ensuring the website supports users carrying out tasks Safety: Ensuring all personal information entered is kept encrypted Learnability: Ensuring the system is easy to use 3.2 50 participants, split among the categories of stakeholders. This would ensure the group is not too large, but also not too small 3.3. open ended Questionnaires and Observation 3.4. It is an area with more people, leading to possible fear of embarrassment by some of the users 3.5 Briefing session Experts are told what to do Evaluation Period: Each expert works independently At least 2 passes through interface Debriefing: Evaluators come together, discuss findings, suggest solutions 4.1 A high level description of how a system is organised and operates 4.2 Explores natural interaction underlying user activities through lenses of different theories, modules and frameworks 4.3 Metaphors convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity 5.1 How we feel and react when interacting with technologies 5.2 Visceral Making products look, feel, and sound good behavioural, Use and equates with traditional values of usability and reflective Taking into account the meaning and personal value of a product in a particular culture 5.3 Conversing, a menu system with colours and children friendly icons and images used Manipulating, children may enjoy interacting with the system by moving the phone around and the phone responding with an action Exploring, the children may enjoy some sort of exploration in the game 6.1. It is the circumstances in which the product is to operate 6.2 Physical environment: Lighting, noise movement Social Environment: Collaboration, coordination Organisational environment: Support, facilities, or resources for training Technical environment: Technical environment 6.3 Some users may not be computer literate, some may not have English as a first language, or they could even be handicapped 6.4. The quality of the system will improve since it arises from a more accurate capture of user requirements. This is because they use the system on a daily basis .Incorporation of costly system features that users cannot or would not want to use can be avoided. Users can be provided with a system that meets their real expectations instead of what designers and developers thought they would want, and thus users won’t encounter surprises when the new system is delivered. By involving users during the process, they will gain a better understanding of the system which will result in more effective use since they would have seen its capabilities from the early stages of development. Users who were involved in the software development process and feel that they have contributed to a product’s development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
