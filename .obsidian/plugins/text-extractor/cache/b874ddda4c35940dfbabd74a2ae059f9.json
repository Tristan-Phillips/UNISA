COS3711 2022 Assignment 3 Rubric Pointers - All objects managed using pointers - Memory managed - XML code generated Unallocated container list - List of containers - Code displayed on GUI using convenience class - Has memento class to correctly manage backup/restore User can add unallocated container to specific pallet in list of pallets Serialising - As a class that can be run as a thread Pity serial code generation was not linked to container. Memento: check which class is the originator; also, you should not do a simple shallow copy of pointers. Had to stop your looping GUI thread to get the program to run.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
