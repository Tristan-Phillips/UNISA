INF3707/101/0/2022 5 3 CURRICULUM TRANSFORMATION Unisa has implemented a transformation charter based on five pillars and eight dimensions. In response to this charter, we have placed curriculum transformation high on the teaching and learning agenda. Curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both programme and module levels as a phased-in approach. You will notice a marked change in the teaching and learning strategy implemented by Unisa, together with how the content is conceptualised in your modules. We encourage you to embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa in a responsive way within the framework of transformation. 4 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 4.1 Lecturer(s) The primary lecturer for this module is Dr B.

This is also true for first-time students to Unisa. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e-learning institution. Unlike face-to-face/contact institutions, Unisa is somewhat different. It is a mega university and all our programmes are offered through a blended learning mode or fully online learning mode. It is for this reason that we thought it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support so that you can seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. In this regard we offer a specialised student support programme to students entering Unisa for the first time. We refer to this programme as 8 Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme. The FYE is designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE programmes are currently offered: • FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE • FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated. • FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (eg videos on how to submit assignments online). • FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e-mail to fye@unisa.ac.za 7. HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 7.1 What does it mean to study fully online? Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa. • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office. • All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you via e-mail and SMS, and use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these platforms to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 7.2 myUnisa tools The main tool that we will use is the Lessons tool. This tool will provide the content of and the assessments for your module. At times you will be directed to join discussions with fellow students and complete activities and assessments before you can continue with the module. It is very important that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you log in at least once a week to do the following: • Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife e-mail account so that you receive the announcement e-mails on your cellphone. • Do the Discussion Forum activities. When you do the activities for each learning unit, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you will need to go online to post your messages. INF3707/101/0/2022 9 • Do other online activities. For some of the learning unit activities you might need to post something on the Blog tool, take a quiz or complete a survey under the Self-Assessment tool. Do not skip these activities because they will help you complete the assignments and the activities for the module. We hope that by giving you extra ways to study the material and practise all the activities, this will help you succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module, you MUST go online regularly to complete the activities and assignments on time. 8. ASSESSMENT 8.1 Assessment plan The following is a breakdown of the formal assessment activities as they become due during the year: Assignment Due date Unique number Weight 01 To be provided 10% 02 To be provided 20% 03 To be provided 40% 04 To be provided 30% *Because this is an online module, the assignments are not provided in this tutorial letter. Instead, the assignments are provided online as they become due. You will see them when you go online. 8.2 Year mark and final examination Your year mark = 20% x (Assignment 01 (10%) + Assignment 02 (20%) + Assignment 03 (40%) + Assignment 04 (30%)) Examination mark = 80 % x Examination mark (out of 100) Final mark = Year mark + Examination mark 9. CONCLUSION Do not hesitate to contact us by e-mail if you are experiencing problems with the content of this tutorial letter or with any academic aspect of the module. We wish you a fascinating and satisfying journey through the learning material, and trust that you will complete the module successfully. Enjoy the journey! INF3707 lecturer DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS, SCHOOL OF COMPUTING 10 ANNEXURE: GLOSSARY OF TERMS APPENDIX: Frequently asked questions • What do I do if I cannot find the prescribed book? See Section 5.2 • What will happen if I fail to submit my assignment on time? If the myUnisa system is down when you try to submit an assignment, do not contact the lecturers. Wait until the problem is resolved and then submit your assignment as soon as possible. We are usually aware of problems with myUnisa. If you submit your assignment late for any other reason, include a note with the assignment in which you give the reasons for the late submission. No assignment will be marked (a mark of ZERO will be awarded) after the solutions for the assignment have been published. This is usually a week or two after the due date of the assignment. • How do I request an extension? Please do not phone, fax or e-mail for an extension to submit an assignment. Submit the assignment as soon as possible and include a note of explanation. • What if there are mistakes in the marking of assignments? (Do NOT resubmit your assignment to Assignments Department!) We use a team of external markers that are subcontracted to mark assignments. Close to 400 students enrol for the module per semester. For this reason, there may be inconsistency in the marking style of individual markers. We request that students only query assignment marking where the marks will change significantly (more than 5%). Please follow the RE-MARK PROCEDURE. The Re-Mark procedure: Mail your marked assignment (or a photocopy of it) TOGETHER WITH A LETTER stating your marking dilemma with the specified questions of the assignment to the module email. • What if I don't receive my study material or I lose it? Visit myUnisa and download an electronic copy (PDF file). • May I submit my assignment by e-mail? No, never do that. • Have we received your assignment? If you want to find out whether Unisa has received your assignment, look at the status of your assignment on myUnisa. © 2022 Unisa","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
