interaction design, there is a principle of “focus on users and tasks early”. This is one of the principles that make it easy and useful to use a computer system. Name and explain the five sub-principles that explain the meaning of the above statement (10 marks) a. Users’ tasks and goals are the driving force behind development. In a user-centered approach to design, while technology will inform design options and choices, it should not be the driving force. b. Users’ behaviour and context of use are studied, and the system is designed to support them. This is about more than just capturing the tasks and users’ goals. How people perform their tasks is also significant. Understanding behaviour highlights priorities, preferences and implicit intentions. c. Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for. Products designed to support humans should take limitations like human error into account and should limit the mistakes they make. d. Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account. e. All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work and their environment. Does not necessarily mean that users are actively involved in design. Designers just need to remain aware of users while making their decisions. (may/jun2017 Q5.2) How would you apply the five sub principles in improving the MyUnisa system (5 marks) Question 2 2.1 What is the strength of using brainstorming in interaction design during the requirements gathering stage? (2 marks) The key strength of brainstorming during requirements gathering is generating alternative ideas that are key in interaction design. 2.2 List any five recommended rules that need to be followed for a requirements gathering brainstorming session to be a success. (10 marks) 1. Include participants from a wide range of disciplines, with a broad range of experience. P a g e 4 | 28 2. Don’t ban silly stuff. Wild ideas often turn into really useful requirements. 3. Use catalysts for further inspiration. Build one idea on top of another. 4. Keep records. Every idea to be captured without censoring. Number ideas for easy reference. Walls and tables in the room to be covered with paper and participants to be encouraged to sketch, mind-map and diagram ideas, including keeping the flow of ideas, as special memory is very strong and this can facilitate recall. 5. Sharpen the focus. Start brainstorming with well-honed problem. 6. Use warm-up exercises and make session fun. Group will require warm-up if they have not worked together before. Question 3 3.1 Briefly describe any three usability goals that would guide your usability testing (6 marks) p457 Primary goal is to determine whether an interface is usable by the intended user population to carry out the tasks for which it was designed. User satisfaction questionnaires and interviews can also be used to elicit users’ opinions about how they found the experience of using the system. Optimal performance levels and minimal levels of acceptance are generally specified and current levels noted 3.2 If you are to evaluate the website in a usability lab, how many participants would you invite? Justify your answer (2 marks) p475 Five to twelve participants is considered an acceptable number. 3.3 Which data capturing methods would you use to collect data from the participants when carrying out the test in a usability laboratory? (3 marks) p476 Typically video cameras will record users’ behaviour, such as movements and facial expression, and general body language. Microphones are also placed near where the participants will be sitting to record their utterances. The observation room with a one way mirror, so that evaluators can watch participants being tested but testers cannot see them. 3.4 What are the disadvantages of carrying out the evaluation in a laboratory? (4 marks) Usability labs can be very expensive and labour-intensive to run and maintain. Modifications would need to be made to these labs on a regular basis when new products or systems are tested, and can be time-consuming. P a g e 5 | 28 3.5 If you were to use heuristic evaluation, discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation. (6 marks) 1. The briefing session: experts are told what to do. A prepared script is useful as a guide and to ensure each person receives the same briefing. 2. The evaluation period, in which each expert typically spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. They need to take at least 2 passes through the interface. Pass one gives a feel for the flow of the interaction and the product’s scope. Pass two allows the evaluator to focus on specific interface elements in the context of the whole product, and to identify potential usability problems. 3. The debriefing session, in which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solution. The heuristics focus on the evaluators’ attention on particular issues, so selecting appropriate heuristics is critically important. Question 4 4.1 What do you understand by the term conceptual model? (2 marks) • Is a high-level description of how a system is organised and operates. • It outlines what users can do with it and the concepts they need in order to understand how to interact with it. 4.2 What are the benefits of conceptualizing the design space? (6 marks) 1. Orientation – enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the target users. 2. Open mindedness – preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focussed early on. 3. Common ground – allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on. Once formulated and agreed upon, a conceptual model can then become a shared blueprint. 4.3 Why are interface metaphors important in interaction design? (2 marks) 45 Interface Metaphors are intended to provide familiar entities that enable people to readily understand the underlying conceptual model and know what to do at an interface. P a g e 6 | 28 Question 5 5.1 What is emotional interaction and what does it entail (3 marks) 133 It is about considering what makes us happy, sad, annoyed, anxious frustrated, motivated, etc. and using this knowledge to inform the design of different aspects of the user experience. 5.2 What are the three levels of Ortony et al (2005) Model of Emotional design? Define and briefly discuss how each level of the model informs the design of a product. Give examples in your discussion. (15 marks) 136 At the lowest level, there is the visceral level. This includes parts of the brain that are pre-wired to automatically respond to events. Responds rapidly, making judgements about what is good/bad, safe/dangerous, pleasure/abhorrent. It also triggers emotional responses to stimuli that are expressed through a combination of physiological and behavioural responses. Behavioural level: includes the brain processes that control our everyday behaviour. This is where most human activities occur. E.g. well-learned routine operations such as talking, typing and driving. Reflective level is the highest level. It includes brain processes that contemplate. It entails conscious thought where people generalise across events or step back from routine and the immediate. 5.3 Young children who cannot read nor write have been observed to have an interest in using or playing with mobile device based applications. Given their interest, it is valuable that interaction designers focus on designing applications that are usable by this group of children. In this respect, as an interaction designer, briefly describe the main interaction types that you would recommend for the design of an interactive game for young children who can neither read nor write (9 marks) 48 Interaction types: 1. Instructing – where users issue instructions to a system like typing in commands, selecting options from menu’s etc. 2. Conversing – where users have a dialog with the system. Users can speak via an interface or type in questions to which a system replies in speech or text. 3. Manipulating – where users interact with objects in virtual space. 4. Exploring – where users move through a virtual environment. P a g e 7 | 28 Question 6 6.1 What are environmental requirements? (2 marks) 353 Environmental requirements refer to circumstances in which the interactive product will operate. There are four aspects of environmental requirements that need to be considered when establishing requirements. 6.2 Briefly discuss four aspects of environment that should be considered when establishing requirements? (8 marks) 1. Physical Environment – such as how much lighting, noise, movement, and dust is expected in the operational environment. 2. Social Environment – e.g. collaboration and coordination to be expected. 3. Organisational Environment – e.g. how good is the user support likely to be, and how easily can it be obtained. 4. Technical Environment 6.3 Which aspects of user characteristics affect the capturing of software requirements? (5 marks) User characteristics capture key attributes of the intended user group, user abilities and skills. The characteristics that affect design is nationality, Education background, preferences, personal circumstances, physical or mental disability, etc. 6.4 What are the five advantages of involving users during software development? (5 marks) 1. Improved quality of systems arising from more accurate capture of user requirements. 2. To avoid incorporation of costly unnecessary system features that users will not want to use. 3. To provide users with a system that meets real expectation. 4. Ensure that users do not encounter surprises when the new system is delivered. 5. Greater understanding of systems by users results in more effective use. 6. Increased participation in decision making within software development cycle increases ownership of system by users. 7. If users are involved, they will have a chance to work with the product before it is released, and they will have a better understanding of what to expect on the new system. P a g e 8 | 28 May/June 2018 Question 1 1.1 Define the following terms: expressive interface, annoying interface and persuasive technology (6 marks) Expressive Interfaces: Can provide reassuring feedback to users as well as be informative and fun. Examples are icons and animations used to indicate the current state of a PC when it is waking up or being rebooted. Annoying Interfaces: Interfaces, if designed poorly can make people look stupid, or feel insulted or threatened. The effect can be to make them annoyed. Many situations that cause such emotional responses include: * When an app doesn’t work properly or crashes. * When a system does not do what user wants it to do. * When user expectations are not met. Persuasive technology: Interactive computer systems that are deliberately designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviours. 1.2 List any five usability goals? (5 marks) 1. Effectiveness to use 2. Efficiency to use 3. Safe to use. 4. Having good utility 5 Learnability 6. Memorability. 1.3 List any five undesirable aspects of user experience (5 marks) Annoying Boring Childish Cutesy Frustrating Patronising Unpleasant. Desirable Challenging Fun Satisfying Rewarding Engaging Entertaining Motivating P a g e 9 | 28 Pleasurable. Helpful Enjoyable 1.4 There is a fine line between an interaction that works and an interaction that is usable. Designing interactions that work and are usable is achievable if design principles are appropriately applied. Discuss the five design principles that guide interaction design. (10 marks) 1. Visibility: The more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know what to do next. 2. Feedback: Involves sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. 3. Constraints: The design concept of constraints refers to determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at any given moment. 4. Consistency: Designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. 5. Affordance: There are two types, perceived and real. It is a term used to refer to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it, e.g. mouse buttons invite you to press them. Question 4 4.2 Shneiderman’s eight golden rules are used as heuristics for identifying usability problems, discuss the four selected rules: a. Cater for universal usability (3 marks) Recognise the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Novice to expert differences, age ranges, disabilities, and technological diversity each enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices, such as explanations, and features for experts, such as shortcuts and faster pacing, can enrich the interface design and improve perceived system quality. b. Permit easy reversal of actions (3 marks) As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data- entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name-address block. c. Support internal locus of control (3 marks) Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions. They don't want P a g e 10 | 28 surprises or changes in familiar behaviour, and they are annoyed by tedious data-entry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary information, and inability to produce their desired result. d. Design dialogues to yield closure (3 marks) Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to prepare for the next group of actions. For example, e-commerce websites move users from selecting products to the checkout, ending with a clear confirmation page that completes the transaction. e. Offer informative feedback (3 marks) For every user action there should be system feedback. a. Strive for consistency Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations. E.g. terminology, menus, help screens, colour, layout, fonts, etc. b. Reduce short-term memory load We can remember ‘7 plus or minus 2 chunks’ of information. Avoid interfaces in which uses must remember information from one screen and then use that info on another screen. c. Prevent errors Design the system such that the user cannot make serious errors. E.g. grey out menu items that are not appropriate, and not allowing alphabetic chars in a numeric sequence. Oct/Nov 2017 Question 1 1.2 How can design of a technology change the attitude and behaviour of people? (11 marks) • Emotional technologies can be designed to persuade people to change their behaviours or attitudes. • Interactive computing systems are deliberately designed to change attitudes and behaviours. • Successful example is amazon’s one-click mechanism that makes it so easy and tempting to buy something at their online shop. • In addition to using interactive technologies as a more targeted and personalised form of advertising, they can be used to change behaviour in non-commercial domains, such as safety, fitness and learning. Emphasis is P a g e 11 | 28 on changing habits or doing something that will improve an individual’s well-being through monitoring their behaviour. Question 2 Discuss McCarthy and Wright (2004)’s four core threads that make up holistic experiences (12 marks) p14 1. Sensual Thread: Is concerned with our sensory engagement with a situation. Can involve thrill, fear, pain or comfort. 2. Compositional Thread: Is concerned with narrative part of an experience, as it unfolds, and the way a person makes sense of it. The compositional thread is the internal thinking we do during experiences. 3. Emotional Thread: The framework points out how emotions are intertwined with the situation in which they arise. Emotions also involve making judgements of value. 4. Spatio-temporal Thread: Refers to the space and time in which our experiences take place and their effect upon those experiences. Question 3 3.1 Explain the role of software design principles? (4 marks) Design principles are used by interaction designers to aid their thinking when designing for the user experience. These are generalisable abstractions intended to orient designers towards thinking about different aspects of their designs. 3.2 List five design principles that are concerned with how to determine what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product according to Preece et al (2015) (5 marks) 1. Visibility: The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to do next. 2. Feedback: Involves sending back information about what action has been done, and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. 3. Constraints: Refers to determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. 4. Consistency: Refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. Benefit of consistent interfaces are that it is easier to learn to use. 5. Affordance: A term used to refer to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. E.g. door handle affords pulling. Mouse button affords pushing. P a g e 12 | 28 3.3 One of the main design principles for website design is simplicity. Nielsen proposed that designers go through all their design elements and remove them one by one. If a design works just well without an element, then just remove it. Do you think this is a good design principle? Discuss (6 marks) Question 4 4.1 Which are the five key issues that require attention for any data gathering session to become successful? (10 marks) 1. Setting Goals: Main reason for gathering data is to obtain information about something. Before beginning it is important to identify specific goals for the study. The goals that are set will influence the nature of the data gathering session, the data gathering techniques to be used, and also the analysis to be performed. 2. Identifying Participants: The goals you develop for your data gathering session will indicate the kind of people you want to gather data from. Those people who fit this profile are called the population. 3. Relationship with Participants: One significant aspect of any data gathering is the relationship between the person doing the gathering and the person providing the data. This relationship needs to be clear and professional, and will help to clarify the nature of the study. Consent needs to be obtained from the participants 4. Triangulation: Is a term used to refer to the investigation of a phenomenon from two different perspectives. There are four types that have been defined (i) Triangulation of data means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in different places, or from different people. (ii) Investigator triangulation means that different researchers have been used to collect and interpret the data. (iii) Triangulation of theories means the use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view the data or findings. (iv) Methodological triangulation means to employ different data gathering techniques. 5. Pilot Studies: It is a small trial run of the main study. The aim is to make sure that the proposed method is viable before embarking on the real study. 4.2 What should be avoided when designing interview questions? (5 marks) p239 Compound sentences can be confusing, so split them into two separate questions. P a g e 13 | 28 Interviewees may not understand jargon or complex language, and might be too embarrassed to admit it, so explain things to them in layman’s terms. Try to keep questions neutral. E.g. why do you like this style of interaction. 4.3 Discuss any five advantages of involving users during software development (10 marks) 1. Improved quality of systems arising from more accurate capture of user requirements. 2. To avoid incorporation of costly system features that users will not want to use. 3. To provide users with a system that meets real expectation. 4. Ensure that users do not encounter surprises when the new system is delivered. 5. Greater understanding of the system by users results in more effective usage. 6. Increased participation in decision making within software development cycle increases ownership of the system by users. 7. If users involved, they will have chance to work with the product before it is released and they will have a better understanding of what to expect on the new system. Question 6 According to Nielsen and Mack (1994), cognitive walkthroughs involve simulating a user’s problem-solving process at each step in the human computer dialog, checking to see if the user’s goals and memory for actions can be assumed to lead to the next correct action Discuss each of the five steps involved in cognitive walkthroughs. (10 marks) P511 Cognitive Walkthroughs involve simulating a user’s problem-solving process. The steps are: 1. Characteristics of typical users are identified and documented, and sample tasks are developed that focus on the aspects of the design to be evaluated. 2. A designer and one or more expert evaluators come together to do the analysis. 3. Evaluators walk through action sequences for each task, placing it within the context of a typical scenario, and as they do this they try to answer the following questions: a. Will the user know what to do to achieve the task? b. Will the user notice that the correct action is available? c. Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly? Will the user know what to do, see how to do it, and understand from feedback whether the action was correct or not. P a g e 14 | 28 4. As walkthrough is being done, a record of critical information is compiled in which: a. The assumptions about what would cause problems and why are identified b. Notes about side issues and design changes are made c. A summary of the results is compiled. 5. The design is then revised to fix the problems presented. May/June 2017 Question 3 A classic early example of a conceptual framework in HCI is Norman’s (1998) explication of the relationship between the design of a conceptual model and the user’s understanding of it. The framework comprises three interacting components. The designer’s model, users’ model and the system image. P58 3.1 Discuss each of the above components (6 marks) Designers Model: The model the designer has of how the system should work. System Image: How the system actually works is portrayed to the user through the interface, manuals, help facilities, and so on. The user’s model: How the user understands how the system work. 3.2 Why is it important that designers consolidate the three components when designing software? (6 marks) The framework makes explicit the relationship between how a system should function, how it is presented to users, and how it is understood by them. Users should be able to carry out activities in the way intended by the designer by interacting with the system image that makes it obvious what to do. Question 4 Several e-readers for reading e-books, watching movies or viewing pictures are available on the market. The exact design differs between models but they support book reading that is intended to be as comfortable as reading a paper book. The developers of a new e- reader want to find out how appealing it will be to young people under 18. To this end, they have asked you to conduct some interviews for them. You are required to answer the following questions in preparation for the interview: 4.1 What is the goal of your data gathering session? (2 marks) Check above, guidelines for goals: P a g e 15 | 28 Main reason for gathering data is to glean information about something. Many different reasons for gathering data, and before beginning, it is important to identify specific goals for the study. The goals that are set will influence the nature of the data gathering session, the data gathering techniques to be used and also the analysis to be performed. 4.2 List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the interview (6 marks) 231 Which data recording approaches are used will depend on the context, time and resources available, and the sensitivity of the situation. Choice of data recording approach will affect level of detail collected, and how intrusive the data gathering will be. In most settings, audio recording, photographs and notes will be sufficient. In others it is essential to collect video data so a to record in detail the intricacies of the activity and its context. Three common data recording approaches are Notes plus photographs Least technical and most flexible Notes can be transcribed, in whole or part. Pen and paper less intrusive than keyboard. Disadvantage: can be difficult and tiring to write or type and listen/observe at same time. Easy to lose concentration, biases creep in, handwriting difficult to decipher, and speed of writing/typing limited. Audio plus photographs Audio recording can be useful alternative to note taking. Is less intrusive than video. Allows observers to focus on activity rather than trying to capture every spoken word. In an interview, it allows interviewer to pay more attention to the interviewee. Transcribing a lot of audio can be time consuming. Audio recording can be supplemented with photographs. Video Advantage of capturing both visual and audio data, but it has some additional planning issues that need to be addressed, and can be intrusive. • Planning include deciding whether to fix camera, or roving recorder, but it will depend on type of activity being recorded. • Deciding where to point camera to capture what is required. • Understanding the impact of the recording on participants. Types of interviews: 1. Unstructured Interviews P a g e 16 | 28 2. Structured interviews 3. Semi-structured 4. Group Interviews. 4.3 Discuss any three disadvantages of taking notes during the interview (6 marks)232 Disadvantage: can be difficult and tiring to write or type and listen/observe at same time. Easy to lose concentration, biases creep in, handwriting difficult to decipher, and speed of writing/typing limited. 4.4 Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals (6 marks) Unstructured interviews are like conversations, with open ended questions. Structured interviews make use of predetermined questions, similar to a questionnaire. Semi-structured Interviews combine features of both. There is a basic script for guidance, so that the same topics are covered with each interviewee. May/June 2017-1 Question 2 2.1 Briefly explain each of the following terms: Usability, framework, conceptual model as they relate to HCI? (6 marks) Usability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use and enjoyable from the user’s perspective. It can be broken down into the following goals: Effective to use (Effectiveness), Efficient to use (Efficiency), Safe to use (Safety), Having good utility (Utility), Easy to learn (Learnability), Easy to remember how to use (Memorability). Conceptual Model is a high-level description of how a system is organises and operates. IT outlines what users can do with it and the concepts they need in order to understand how to interact with it. Framework is a set of interrelate concepts and/or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area, online communities, or an analytic method. P a g e 17 | 28 Paradigm refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices. Vision is a future scenario that frames research and development in interaction design, often depicted in the form of a film or narrative. Theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon. A Model is a simplification of some aspect of HCI intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. 2.2 Discuss the core components of a conceptual model (8 marks) The core components of a conceptual model is as follows: 1. Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity. 2. The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, incl. the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them. 3. The relationships between those concepts. 4. The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support/invoke. Best Cm’s are those that appear obvious; the operations they support being intuitive to use. 2.3 In which three ways can metaphors and analogies be applied in conceptual design (6 marks) IM are intended to provide familiar entities that enable people to readily understand the underlying conceptual model and know what to do at an interface Question 3 3.1 Explain what is meant by persuasive technology (2 marks) Interactive computer systems that are deliberately designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviours. E.g. a user may be tempted or persuaded to buy more than he/she intended from a website. 3.2 Give any example of persuasion (1 marks) A successful example of persuasion is Amazon.com’s one-click mechanism that makes it so easy and tempting to buy something in the online store. May/June 2016 P a g e 18 | 28 Question 1 Consider the five design principles (affordance, feedback, visibility, consistency and constraints). a. Explain each principle clearly and describe by the use of an example on how it could be used towards good design of a cell phone (15 marks) Visibility: The more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know what to do next. Feedback: Related to the concept of visibility. It involves sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. Constraints: Refers to determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. Consistency: Refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. Affordance: Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. E.g. door handle affords pulling, mouse button affords pushing. b. For each of the five design principles, identify one difference between cell pone and conventional desktop interfaces that are important to usability designers or evaluators. Explain clearly why and how the difference matter. (10 marks) Question 2 Everyone at some time or other gets frustrated when using a computer. The effect ranges from feeling mildly amused to extremely angry. Discuss any 5 reasons that can explain user frustration with using computers (10 marks) 1. If a system is not effective to use, in that it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do or what the user wants it to do. 2. If a system is not efficient to use, for example, if it’s slow to respond and doesn’t work properly, or if there are too many steps for simple tasks. Or if mistakes are made, and the user has to start all over, i.e. recoverability is bad. 3. If a system is not easy to learn – if the design principles of good visibility (easy to find the functions needed), consistency (it works in the same way in similar situations) and affordance (understanding what to do by getting clues from the interface) are neglected, making it not obvious what to do in various situations. P a g e 19 | 28 4. If the system is not easy to remember how to use, it means effort to re- learn things every time the user uses it, which is frustrating, for example, having featuritis – an excessive number of possible operations and poor consistency. 5. If the system doesn’t provide feedback about current status, or about the results or consequences of user actions, it can become confusing and frustrating. 6. If the interface is generally overloaded with flashing animations, text and graphics, the over-use of sound effects and music and so on, it is not a pleasant user experience. Question 3 Heuristic evaluation is an informal usability inspection technique developed by Nielson and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user- interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure, on-line help etc conform to the principles. Discuss heuristic evaluation under the following headings: a. The heuristics for evaluation (4 marks) 1. Visibility of system status – The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 2. Match between system and the real world – The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 3. User control and freedom – Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog. Support undo and redo. 4. Consistency and standards – Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. 5. Error prevention – Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. P a g e 20 | 28 6. Recognition rather than recall – Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialog to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use – Accelerators – unseen by the novice user – may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design – Dialogs should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialog competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors – Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. 10. Help and documentation – Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. b. The three stages of doing heuristic evaluation (4 marks) 1. The briefing sessions where the experts are told what to do. A prepared script is useful as a guide and to ensure each person receives the same briefing. 2. The evaluation period, where each expert typically spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. They will take at least two passes through the interface, to get a feel for the product’s flow and scope, and then to focus on specific interface elements and identify potential usability problems. 3. The debriefing session, in which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solutions. c. Possible problems encountered when doing heuristic evaluation (4 marks) P a g e 21 | 28 Question 6 Interviews can be viewed as a conversation with a purpose between two or more people where questions are asked by the interviewer to get facts or clarity from the interviewee. Name and discuss the four main types of interviews (12 marks) Unstructured (open-ended) interviews ▪ Exploratory and more like conversations ▪ No particular expectation about the format or content of answers ▪ Benefits: o Generates rich data that gives a deep understanding of topic. o Unconsidered issues may be revealed. Structured interviews ▪ Predetermined questions, same questions for each participant. ▪ Typically closed questions. ▪ Useful when the goals are clearly understood. Semi-structured interviews ▪ Uses both closed and open-ended questions. Basic script for guidance so that same topics are covered for all participants, but question could take different paths based on participants responses and interviewer’s probing. Oct/Nov 2015 Question 1 Briefly explain the two kinds of affordance as suggested by Norman (1988) (4 marks) There are two types of affordance, Perceived and Real. Question 3 3.2 Explain how each of the core components of a conceptual model relates to any of the usability goals. (8 marks) 1. Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity (e.g. browsing and bookmarking). This can relate to utility. 2. The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them (e.g. saving, organising). This relates to effectiveness. P a g e 22 | 28 3. The relationships between those concepts (e.g. whether one object contains another and the relative importance of actions to others). Learnability. 4. The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (e.g. one can revisit through looking at a list of visited sites, most frequently visited, or saved websites). Efficiency to use Question 4 Briefly explain, with the aid of examples, the purpose of interface metaphors in conceptual design. (4 marks) ▪ Interface metaphors are based on conceptual models that combine familiar knowledge with new concepts, hence, helps users to easily understand the underlying model. ▪ Exploit user’s familiar knowledge, helping them to understand the unfamiliar, hence, makes learning new systems easier. ▪ It is easier to learn and talk about what you are doing on a computer interface in terms of what you familiar to in your daily life. ▪ Enables a greater diversity of users to understand computer functionality. ▪ Improve users’ confidence. Question 7 7.1 Briefly explain the four types of triangulation used during data gathering (8 marks) Triangulation is a term used to refer to the investigation of a phenomenon from two different perspectives. Four types of triangulation have been defined: 1. Triangulation of data means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in different places, from different people. 2. Investigator triangulation means that different researchers have been used to collect and interpret data. 3. Triangulation of theories means the use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view the data or findings. 4. Methodological triangulation means to employ different data gathering techniques. 7.2 Explain how each type of triangulation can be used during data gathering of myUnisa student system (8 marks) 1. Triangulation of data: 2. Investigator triangulation: 3. Triangulation of theories: P a g e 23 | 28 4. Methodological triangulation: Question 8 List four advantages of collecting data using web-based questionnaires. (4 marks) Web-based questionnaires are interactive and can include check boxes, radio buttons pull-down and pop-up menus, etc. They can also provide immediate data validation. They provide faster response rates and automatic transfer of responses into a database for analysis. Question 9 Briefly discuss the three principles (Gould and Lewis (1985)) that lead to a ‘useful and easy to use computer system’ (12 marks) Question 10 Explain two main problems using Hierarchical Task Analysis on real problems (4 marks) 1. Real tasks are very complex, and task analysis does not scale very well. 2. Task analysis is limited in the kinds of task it can model. E.g. it cannot model tasks that are overlapping, or in parallel, nor can it model interruptions. Question 11 Evaluation can be performed either during the design or after completion of a software product. Identify and briefly discuss these two different evaluation goals. (4 marks) Question 12 Briefly explain the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation (10 marks) ▪ The briefing sessions where the experts are told what to do. A prepared script is useful as a guide and to ensure each person receives the same briefing. ▪ The evaluation period, where each expert typically spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. They will take at least two passes through the interface, to get a feel for the product’s flow and scope, and then to focus on specific interface elements and identify potential usability problems. ▪ The debriefing session, in which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solutions. P a g e 24 | 28 May/Jun 2015 Question 1 1.1 Consider any six of the user experience goals in Preece et al for each of these a. Identify (name) and explain each user experience goal clearly. (12 marks) Enjoyable Helpful Exciting Challenging Entertaining Fun b. Give and describe an example of it being used in the design of your cell phone. (12 marks) c. For each of these six user experience goals, identify one difference between cell phones and conventional desktop interfaces that are important to usability designers or evaluators. Explain clearly why and how these difference matter. (12 marks) 1.2 Consider Preece et al’s five design principles. For each of the five design principles (a) name and explain it briefly, and (b) also give an example of how the specific design principle can help to achieve one or more of the six user experience goals you have identified in question 1.1 (15 marks) 1. Visibility – The more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know what to do next. 2. Feedback – Sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. 3. Constraints – Determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. 4. Consistency – Designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. 5. Affordance – Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it, to ‘give a clue’. There are two types of affordance, Perceived and Real. P a g e 25 | 28 Question 2 2.1 Briefly compare the use of notes, audio and video when recording usability study data (6 marks) ▪ The interviewer can take notes and photographs of the interview. Taking notes is the least technical and most flexible way of recording data, and photographs of artefacts can be used to supplement notes. ▪ The interviewee can be recorded with an audio recording device and photographs can supplement the audio content if required. Audio recording is a good alternative to note taking and less intrusive than video. ▪ The interviewee can be recorded on video with a camera. May require more than one camera in different locations to capture all that is required. P a g e 26 | 28 2.2 Discuss and explain the differences between paradigms, theories, models and frameworks as it relates to HCI. Give appropriate examples where possible (12 marks) Paradigm: Refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values and practices. Vision: Future scenario that frames research and development in interaction design – often depicted in the form of a film/narrative. Theory: Well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon. Model: simplification of some aspect of HCI intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. Framework: Set of interrelated concepts and or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area, online communities or analytical method. 2.3 Identify and briefly discuss four typical problems or challenges that may occur during a heuristic evaluation. Use examples to illustrate the problem (16 marks) Sometimes heuristic evaluation misses severe problems. Heuristic evaluation should not be thought of as a replacement for user testing. Another problem concerns experts reporting problems that don’t exist. Approximately 43% of these problems that were identified was not problems at all, only false alarms. 2.4 Answer the following questions: (15 marks) (a) Design a five question, questionnaire that will help you answer the following question “How easy is it for student users to use MyUnisa?” (b) Explain the format and nature of the questions that you have used (c) For each question indicate and explain which (if any) of the Preece et al six usability goals it will measure P a g e 27 | 28 May/Jun 2019 Question 1.4 Outline four principles that guide the conceptualization of a design space (4 marks) Question 1.6 Draw a conceptual model of a learning management system platform. The conceptual model should be simple and easy to understand (10 marks) Question 2 As a consultant, you were hired to help with designing a mobile application that can help elderly people with taking medication for some chronic disease. It is common knowledge that elderly people resist using new technologies which they are not familiar with. Discuss persuasive strategies that you would employ to design the mobile application to persuade the elderly to use it. (12 marks) Question 3.3 One of the main design principles for website design is simplicity. Nielsen proposes that designers go through all of their design elements and remove them one by one. If a design works just as well without an element, then remove it. Do you think this is a good design principle? (6 marks) Simplicity is an important design principle. Many designers try to cram too much into a screenful of space. Removing design elements to see what can be discarded without affecting the overall function of the website can be a beneficial lesson. After these elements have been removed, a cleaner crisper and easier to navigate website is left behind. Graphics, shading, colouring and formatting can make a site aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable to use. Plain vanilla sites with just lists of text and a few links may not be as appealing to visitors. Good interaction design involves getting the right balance tween aesthetic appeal and the optimal amount and kind of information per page. P a g e 28 | 28","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
