CONCLUSION ............................................................................................................................ 17 ADDENDUM A: ...................................................................................................................................... 18 1 INTRODUCTION Welcome to COS1501! This is a fully online year module presented by the School of Computing. (The previous module code was COS101S.) Because this is a fully online module, you will need to use myUnisa to study and complete the learning activities for this module. Visit the website for COS1501 on myUnisa frequently. The website for your module is COS1501-22-Y1. You have to work through the lessons on myUnisa and follow the instructions when you are guided to work through the respective study guide units. As from 2021 this module will be a year module, and not a semester module. I urge you to study this tutorial carefully if you are repeating the module, as information regarding assignment submission have changed drastically. This module focuses on discrete mathematics and its application in Computer Science. Concepts and skills needed for a theoretical understanding of Computer Science are introduced. If you feel a flash of fear when you hear the word “theoretical”, just remember that theory is much tidier than practice: one knows precisely what the meaning of the terms is and the problems always have solutions. Rigorous proofs are expected in this module. This module does not involve practical work on a computer, but there is a strong emphasis on practicing the skills acquired by means of doing many exercises and the assignments. Studying a mathematical module is rather like learning to play a musical instrument – the more you practice, the better you become! If you put an honest effort into trying to do the self- assessment exercises and assignments, we believe that by the end of the year you will be able to do many things you had never heard of before, and enjoy doing them. All other tutorial letters are available on myUnisa under Additional Resources. All tutorial letters contain important information, so make sure you read each one carefully. The letters are of three kinds: - those numbered 101 (such as this one), 102 and 103 are concerned specifically with the tutorial matter for COS1501; - those numbered 201, 202, 203 contain solutions to assignments; - Tutorial letter 102 and the tutorial letter 103 under Additional Resources contain some important information, such as solutions to the self-assessment exercises in the 101; - the COSALL tutorial letter contains important information (including the names and contact numbers of lecturers) for all students in the School of Computing. The School of Computing is situated at the Florida campus. 4 NOTES REGARDING THE myUnisa SYSTEM We refer to the following tabs/items on or reference to the myUnisa system throughout this letter: - myUnisa tools - myModules - Sites - Signing into the system - Assessment info - Additional Resources - Discussion forum - Official study material - Online assignments / exams - Announcements - Lessons - E-tutor sites Please note that all reference to / description of the above, refers to the current myUnisa system. The University is planning to upgrade this system for 2022. As we do not yet have all the details of how the system will change, we will inform you of any changes early in 2022, during which time any procedures/guidelines described in this letter, will be updated if needed. 1.1 Getting started Owing to the nature of this module, you can read about the module and find your study material online.

COS1501/101/0/2022 5 2 OVERVIEW OF COS1501 2.1 Purpose Students who have completed this module successfully will be able to critically apply the fundamental knowledge and skills of discrete mathematics. The module forms part of the theoretical foundation of a Computer Science major. This background is relevant to computing fields such as relational databases, the development of provably correct programs, and the analysis of algorithms that will contribute to the development of computing in Southern Africa, Africa, or globally. The module will support further studies and applications in the computing discipline. 2.2 Outcomes For this module, you will have to master several outcomes: • Specific outcome 1: Manipulate logical arguments, using a variety of mathematical tools. • Specific outcome 2: Construct proofs in a clear and concise way using mathematical reasoning techniques. • Specific outcome 3: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the definitions, laws and operations of set theory. • Specific outcome 4: Synthesise and critically analyse relations, functions and binary sets that are represented as sets containing ordered pairs. • Specific outcome 5: Perform operations on vectors and matrices. 3 CURRICULUM TRANSFORMATION Unisa has implemented a transformation charter based on five pillars and eight dimensions. In response to this charter, we have placed curriculum transformation high on the teaching and learning agenda. Curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both programme and module levels as a phased- in approach. You will notice a marked change in the teaching and learning strategy implemented by Unisa, together with how the content is conceptualised in your modules. We encourage you to embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa in a responsive way within the framework of transformation. 4 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 4.1 Lecturer(s) The primary lecturer for this module is Ms Drina du Plessis Department: School of Computing Telephone: 011 670 9109 / 0607666031 E-mail: dpleshw@unisa.ac.za 6 Whenever you contact a lecturer via e-mail, please include your student number in the subject line to enable the lecturer to help you more effectively. 4.2 Department You can contact the School of Computing as follows: Telephone number: 011 670 9200 E-mail: computing@unisa.ac.za 4.3 University To contact the University, follow the instructions on the Contact us page on the Unisa website.

This is also true for first-time students to Unisa. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e-learning institution. Unlike face-to-face/contact institutions, Unisa is somewhat different. It is a mega university and all our programmes are offered through a blended learning mode or fully online learning mode. It is for this reason that we thought it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support so that you can seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. In this regard we offer a specialised student COS1501/101/0/2022 9 support programme to students entering Unisa for the first time. We refer to this programme as Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme. The FYE is designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE programmes are currently offered: • FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE • FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated. • FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (eg videos on how to submit assignments online). • FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e-mail to fye@unisa.ac.za 6.2 E-tutors With effect from 2013, Unisa offers online tutorials (e-tutoring) to students registered for modules at NQF level 5, 6 and 7, this means qualifying undergraduate modules. Once you have been registered for a qualifying module, you will be allocated to a group of students with whom you will be interacting during the tuition period as well as with an e-tutor who will be your tutorial facilitator. Thereafter you will receive an sms informing you about your group, the name of your e-tutor and instructions on how to log onto myUnisa in order to receive further information on the e-tutoring process. Online tutorials are conducted by qualified e-tutors who are appointed by Unisa and are offered free of charge. All you need to be able to participate in e-tutoring is a computer with internet connection. If you live close to a Unisa regional center, please feel free to visit this center to access the internet. E-tutoring takes place on myUnisa where you are expected to connect with other students in your allocated group. It is the role of the e-tutor to guide you through your study material during this interaction process. To get the most out of online tutoring, you need to participate in the online discussions that the e-tutor will be facilitating. Please make use of this opportunity. The e-tutor is also available if you need any help with questions from old exam papers – post your questions on the discussion forum of your e-tutor group, and the e-tutor and your fellow students will comment and assist. There are modules that students have been found to repeatedly fail, these modules are allocated face-to-face tutors and tutorials for these modules take place at the Unisa regional centers. These tutorials are also offered free of charge, however, it is important for you to register at your nearest Unisa regional center to secure attendance of these classes. 6.3 Free computer and internet access Unisa has entered into partnerships with establishments (referred to as Telecentres) in various locations across South Africa to enable you (as a Unisa student) free access to computers and the Internet. This access enables you to conduct the following academic related activities: registration; online submission of assignments; engaging in e-tutoring activities and signature courses; etc. Please note that any other activity outside of these is for your own costing e.g. 10 printing, photocopying, etc. For more information on the Telecentre nearest to you, please visit www.unisa.ac.za/telecentres. 7. HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 7.1 What does it mean to study fully online? Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa. • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office. • All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you via e-mail and SMS, and use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these platforms to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 7.2 myUnisa tools The main tool that we will use is the Lessons tool. This tool will provide the content of and the assessments for your module. The lessons contain many videos that you may watch, should you battle to understand certain concepts in the textbook. Please note that these videos are not compulsory to watch, and that you will not be examined on them. However, they are quite helpful if you need to refresh your memory about specific topics in the textbook. It is very important that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you log in at least once a week to do the following: • Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife e-mail account so that you receive the announcement e-mails on your cellphone. • Do the Discussion Forum activities. When you do the activities for each lesson, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you will need to go online to post your messages. Your e-tutor will post the activities on the Discussion Forum. • Do other online activities. For some of the lesson activities you might need to complete a Self-Assessment exercise. Do not skip these activities because they will help you complete the assignments and the activities for the module. We hope that by giving you extra ways to study the material and practise all the activities, this will help you succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module, you MUST go online regularly to complete the activities and assignments on time. COS1501/101/0/2022 11 8. ASSESSMENT 8.1 Assessment criteria The assessment criteria is given per specific outcome: Specific outcome 1: Think in an abstract way, to manipulate logical arguments, using a variety of mathematical tools. Assessment criteria • Predicates and symbols are used, to represent properties or relations, all formulated as English sentences; • A given set of logical connectives is used to combine propositions and predicate logic atoms, correctly, from given English sentences into equivalent logic sentences; • Truth tables illustrate the result of logical connectives, with the correct relationships; • Quantifiers generalise over predicate logic sentences, within the context; • Classifications of compound statements include tautology, contradiction or neither; • Arguments around propositional and a predicate logic sentences are valid.

This means that your final mark is based not only on your examination mark, but also on your performance during the year. Assignments do not only provide you with an opportunity to evaluate your understanding of the prescribed material (or to give you feedback on your readiness for the examination), but also make a contribution towards your year mark. Your final mark will be calculated as follows: Year mark (out of 100) × 20% + Examination mark (out of 100) × 80% In order to pass this module, a final mark of at least 50% is required. Your year mark is based on your assignment marks. Different weights are allocated to the individual assignments. If an assignment is not submitted or is submitted late (for whatever reason), no marks are awarded for such an assignment. It is your responsibility to ensure that your assignments are submitted on time. Multiple choice assignments are marked by a computer system at a time set out by the Assignment Section of Unisa – lecturers can therefore not give any extension for multiple choice assignments. There are 4 assignments for this module. Assignments will be made available on myUnisa. You will be informed where to find your assignments. The following weights are allocated to the individual assignments: • Assignment 01: 15% • Assignment 02: 30% • Assignment 03: 30% • Assignment 04: 25% Example: The following example shows how the assessment system works, assuming that assignments 01, 02, 03 and 04 were all submitted. Assignment Mark × Weight Contribution to year mark Type of assessment 01 90% × 0.15 13.5% MCQ – more details will be given via an announcement 02 90% × 0.30 27% MCQ – more details will be given via an announcement 03 90% × 0.30 27% MCQ – more details will be given via an announcement 04 90% X 0.25 22.5% MCQ – more details will be given via an announcement year mark 90% The resulting year mark is 90%. Suppose you obtain 80% in the examination. The final mark will be calculated as follows: (90 × 0.20)% + (80 × 0.80)% = (18.0 + 64.0)% = 82%. 16 You can therefore see that in order to get a good year mark that will not influence your examination mark negatively, it is important to put in enough effort in completing your assignments. Note: The year mark will not contribute towards the final exam of students writing a supplementary examination. Assignment questions will be provided online on myUnisa. Please check the announcements on a regular basis. 8.4 Assignment numbers • There are no assignment due dates included in this tutorial letter. • Assignment due dates for Assignments 1 to 4 will be made available to you on the landing page of myUnisa for this module, and on the calendar.
