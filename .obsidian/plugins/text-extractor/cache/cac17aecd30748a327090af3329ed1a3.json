Row(1) = position(1) till position(3), Row(2) = position(4) till position(6), Row(3) = position(7) till position(8) 1.2) a) The start state: {1, 5, 8, 6, 2, B, 3, 4, 7} b) The goal state: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, B} 1.3) Yes, any given goal state can be reached by starting with any rearrangement of the start state. This is because, all tile positions are accessible to all tiles given enough moves 1.4) Move(T ile, Direction) -> {tile, position} : This allows us to move a tile horizontally or vertically to achieve its new position Possible(Position, Direction) -> {T rue, False} : This allows us to check if either of the horizontal or vertical positions are blank, if true then we can move our tile there, if false then we can not move our tile there","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
