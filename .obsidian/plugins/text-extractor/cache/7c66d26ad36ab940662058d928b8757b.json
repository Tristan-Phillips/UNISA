In interaction design it can be (among other things): • a series of screen sketches • a storyboard, i.e. a cartoon-like series of scenes • a Powerpoint slide show • a video simulating the use of a system • a lump of wood (e.g. PalmPilot) • a cardboard mock-up • a piece of software with limited functionality written in the target language or in another language 6www.id-book.com Why prototype? • Evaluation and feedback are central to interaction design • Stakeholders can see, hold, interact with a prototype more easily than a document or a drawing • Team members can communicate effectively • Ideas can be tested out • Prototyping encourages reflection: an important aspect of design • Prototypes answer questions, and support designers in choosing between alternatives 7 Low-fidelity Prototyping • Uses a medium which is unlike the final medium, e.g. paper, cardboard • Is quick, cheap and easily changed • Examples: – sketches of screens, task sequences, etc – ‘post-it’ notes – storyboards – ‘Wizard-of-Oz’ www.id-book.com 8www.id-book.com Storyboards • Often used with scenarios, bringing more detail, and a chance to role play • It is a series of sketches showing how a user might progress through a task using the product 9 Example storyboard www.id-book.com 10 www.id-book.com Sketching • Low-fidelity prototyping often relies on sketching • Don’t be inhibited about drawing ability. Practice simple symbols 14www.id-book.com Prototyping with index cards • Index cards (3 x 5 inches) • Each card represents one element of interaction • In evaluation, can step through the cards 15www.id-book.com ‘Wizard-of-Oz’ prototyping • The user thinks they are interacting with a computer, but a human is responding to output rather than the system. • Usually done early in design to understand users’ expectations • What is ‘wrong’ with this approach? >Blurb blurb >Do this >Why? User 13 High-fidelity prototyping • Uses materials that you would expect to be in the final product • Prototype looks more like the final system than a low-fidelity version • High-fidelity prototypes can be developed by integrating existing hardware and software components • Danger that users think they have a complete system…….see compromises www.id-book.com 14www.id-book.com Compromises in prototyping • Prototyping involve compromises • For software-based prototyping maybe there is a slow response? sketchy icons? limited functionality? • “in the wild” prototypes operational but not necessarily robust • Two common types of compromise • horizontal: provide a wide range of functions, but with little detail • vertical: provide a lot of detail for only a few functions • Compromises in prototypes must not be ignored. Product needs engineering 15 Conceptual design www.id-book.com • A conceptual model is an outline of what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand and interact with it • Understand problem space and current requirements; empathise with users • Creativity and brainstorming techniques • Mood board may be capture desired feel • Consider alternatives: scenarios and prototyping helps 16 Building scenarios www.id-book.com 17 Empathising with users www.id-book.com 18 The Third Age Suit Source: Ford Motor Co. Choosing an interface metaphor • Interface metaphors combine familiar knowledge with new knowledge in a way that will help the user understand the product. • Three steps: understand functionality, identify potential problem areas, generate metaphors • Evaluate metaphors: ⎻ How much structure does it provide? ⎻ How much is relevant to the problem? ⎻ Is it easy to represent? ⎻ Will the audience understand it? ⎻ How extensible is it? 19www.id-book.comwww.id-book.com Considering interaction and interface types • Which interaction type? – How the user invokes actions – Instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring or responding • Do different interface types provide insight? – Shareable, tangible, augmented reality, etc. 20www.id-book.com Expanding the initial conceptual model • What functions will the product perform? ⎻ What will the product do and what will the human do? • How are the functions related to each other? ⎻ Sequential or parallel? ⎻ Categorisations, e.g. all actions related to privacy on a smartphone • What information is needed? ⎻ What data is needed to perform the task? ⎻ How is this data to be transformed by the system? 21 Concrete design • Difference between conceptual and concrete is emphasis • Many aspects to concrete design – Color, icons, buttons, interaction devices etc • User characteristics and context – Inclusiveness, input and output modes • Accessibility – Web Content Accessibility Guidelines • Cross-cultural design – Language, Colors, icons, information architecture – Indigenous knowledge and perspectives www.id-book.com 22 Generating prototypes • Generate a storyboard from a scenario ⎻ Break down scenario into steps ⎻ Create a scene for each step • Sketching out a storyboard prompts designers to think about design issues • Generate a card-based prototype from a storyboard or from a use case ⎻ Consider each step in use case – what interaction element is needed ⎻ Draw a card that captures it www.id-book.com 23 Generating storyboard www.id-book.com 24 Generating card-based prototype www.id-book.com 25 Explore the user’s experience • Use personas, card-based prototypes or stickies to model the user experience • Visual representation called: – design map – customer/user journey map – experience map • Two common representations – wheel – timeline www.id-book.com 27 An experience map drawn as a wheel www.id-book.com 28 Source: LEGO An experience map drawn as a timeline www.id-book.com 29 Source: Adlin and Pruitt (2010), p134 User courtesy of Morgan Kaufmann Construction: physical computing • Build and code prototypes using electronics • Toolkits available include – Arduino – LilyPad (for fabrics) – Senseboard – BBC micro:bit – MaKey MaKey • Designed for use by wide range of people www.id-book.com 30 Physical computing kits www.id-book.com 31 Source: Used courtesy of Dr Nicolai Marquardt The Arduino board Physical computing kits www.id-book.com 32 The Makey Makey toolkit Physical computing kits www.id-book.com 33 Source: https://microbit.org/guide/features. Used courtesy of Micro:bit Foundation The BBC micro:bit Construction: SDKs • Software Development Kits – programming tools and components to develop for a specific platform, e.g. iOS • Includes: IDE, documentation, drivers, sample code, application programming interfaces (APIs) • Makes development much easier • Examples: – Amazon’s Alexa Skills Kit for voice-based services – Apple’s ARKit for augmented reality – Microsoft’s Kinect SDK for motion tracking www.id-book.com 34 Summary • Prototyping may be low fidelity (such as paper-based) or high fidelity (such as software-based) • Existing software and hardware helps create prototypes • Two aspects to design: conceptual and concrete • Conceptual design develops an outline of what users can do and what concepts are needed to understand the product. Concrete design specifies design details, e.g. layout or navigation • Three approaches to develop an initial conceptual model: interface metaphors, interaction styles, and interface styles. • Expand an initial conceptual model by considering whether product or user performs each function, how those functions are related, and what information is required to support them • Generate prototypes from scenarios and use cases • Physical computing kits and software development kits facilitate the transition from design to construction www.id-book.com 34","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
