What is an Information System? First we need to break it down to get to the understanding and definition of IS: 1.1 What is a System? It is a set of elements or components that interact to accomplish goals. A system consist of four component:  Input – the activity of gathering and capturing data  Processing – converting or transforming data into useful outputs  Output – production of useful information, often in the form of documents and reports  Feedback – output that is used to make changed to input or processing activities 1.2 What is Information? Simply a collection of facts. Characteristics of Valuable Information: Characteristics Definitions Accessible Easily accessible by authorized users Accurate Information that is error free Complete Contains all the important information Economical Cost versus benefit is worthy Flexible Information is useful in different areas Relevant Contains Information that is important to decision makers Reliable Contains information you can depend on Secure Safe from authorized users Simple Not complex or difficult to understand Timely Delivered when needed Verifiable Check to verify if correct Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Therefore, an Information system is a set of interrelated components that collect, manipulate, store and disseminate information and provide a feedback mechanism to meet an objective Manual and Computerised Information Systems  A Computer-based Information System (CBIS) is a single set of hardware, software, database, telecommunications, people, and procedures that is configured to collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information. Components of a CBIS Hardware – any machinery that assists in the input, processing, storage, and output activities of an information system (e.g. Keyboard, mouse, Monitor etc.) Software – the computer programs that govern the operation of the computer (e.g. Microsoft Windows) Database – an organised collection of electronic information Telecommunications – the electronic transmission of signals for communications; enables organisations to carry out their processes and tasks through effective computer networks. Usually involves the following: o Networks – computers and equipment that are connected in a building, around the country or around the world to enable electronic communication o Internet – the world’s largest computer network, actually consisting of thousands of interconnected networks, all freely exchanging information o Cloud Computing – a computing environment where software and storage are provided as an internet service and are accessed via a Web browser o Intranet – an internal company network built using internet and World Wide Web standards and products that allows people within an organisation to exchange information and work on projects Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 o Extranet – a network based on web technologies that allows selected outsiders, such as suppliers or business partners to access authorised resources of a company’s intranet People – users of the system Procedures – the strategies, policies, methods and rules for using a CBIS 2. Business Information Systems 2.1 Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) A transaction is any business related exchange, such as payments to employees, sales to customers and payments to suppliers. Therefore, a TPS is an organised collection of people, procedures, software, databases and devices used to record completed business transactions. 2.2 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) A set of integrated programs capable of managing a company’s vital business operations for an entire multisite, global organisation. It checks what is already available in finished products inventory to meet the projected demand 2.3 Management Information Systems (MISs) Is an organised collection of people, procedures, software, databases, and devices that provides routine information to managers and decision-makers. When designing an MIS: Clearly define the systems objectives Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Collect and analyse data Provide information in a useful format for decision-making purposes Decision Support System (DSS) is an organised collection of people, procedures, software, databases, and devices used to support problem specific decision making. 2.4 Knowledge Management (KM), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Expert Systems and Virtual Reality  Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer system to mimic or duplicate the functions or characteristics of the human brain or intelligence Major elements of Artificial Intelligence: o Robotics o Vision Systems o Learning Systems o Neural Networks o Expert Systems  Expert System is a system that gives a computer the ability to make suggestions and act like an expert in a particular field  Virtual Reality is the simulation of a real or imagined environment that can be experienced visually in three dimensions 3. Systems Development The activity of creating or modifying existing business systems. An Overview of Systems Development:  Systems investigation – understand the problem  Systems analysis – determine what must be done to solve the problem  Systems design – the solution is planned out  Systems implementation – the solution is built or bought, and replaces the old system  Systems maintenance and review – the new system is evaluated 4. Global Challenges in Information Systems People and businesses can get products and services from around the world, instead of around the corner or across town. However, these opportunities introduce numerous obstacles and issues such as the ones listed below: 1. Cultural challenges 2. Language challenges 3. Time and distance challenges 4. Infrastructure challenges 5. Currency challenges Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 6. Product and service challenges 7. Technology transfer issues 8. National laws 9. Trade agreements Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CHAPTER 2 Information Systems in Organisations 1. An Introduction to Organisations An organisation is a formal collection of people and other resources established to accomplish a set of goals. An organisation is also a system, meaning that it has inputs, processing mechanisms, outputs and feedback. Resources such as materials, people and money serve as inputs to the organisational system from the environment, go through a transformation mechanism and then are produced as outputs to the environment. The outputs from the transformation mechanism are usually goods or services which are of higher value than the inputs alone. Value Chain is a series (or chain) of activities an organisation performs to transform inputs into outputs in such a way that the value of the input is increased. Refer to Figure 2.1 in the prescribed textbook. 1.1 Organisational Structures An organisational structure refers to the organisational subunits and the way they relate to the overall organisation. There is a few types of organisational structures and are as follows: Traditional Organisational structure This structure is similar to a managerial pyramid, where the hierarchy of decision making and authority flows from strategic management at the top down to operational management and non-management employees. It is also called a hierarchical structure. Nowadays, organisations tend to reduce the number of management levels in an organisation, and this type of structure is called a flat organisational structure (which empowers employees at lower levels to make decisions and solve problems without needing permissions from mid-level managers. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Project Organisational Structure A structure centred on major products or services. Team Organisational Structure A structure centred on work teams or groups. Virtual Organisational Structure A structure that employs individuals, groups or complete business units in geographically dispersed areas that can last for a few weeks or years, often requiring telecommunications or the Internet. An organisation can use a virtual organisational structure with its own dispersed workers who have distinct skills and abilities to reduce costs. A virtual organisation can also provide an extra level of security to an organisation. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 1.2 Organisational Change The responses that are necessary so that for-profit and non-profit organisations can plan for, implement and handle change. The need for organisational change can be caused by internal factors, such as those initiated by employees at all levels, or external factors, such as activities brought by competitors, stakeholders, new laws, community regulations, natural occurrences, and general economic conditions. Change can be:  Sustaining – for example new or cheaper production equipment can help an organisation improve its operations  Disruptive – often harms the organisation’s performance or even puts it out of business When an organisation introduces a new information system, a few members of the organisation must become agents of change – champions of the new system and its benefits. These members must understand the dynamics of change that can help them confront and overcome resistance so that the new system can be used to maximum efficiency and effectiveness. A significant portion of an organisation’s expenses are used to hire, train, and compensate talented staff. So organisations try to control costs by determining the number of employees they need to maintain high-quality goods and services. Strategies to contain costs includes:  Outsourcing – contracting with outside professional services to meet specific business needs  On-demand Computing – contracting for computer resources to rapidly respond to an organisation’s varying workflow. Also called “on-demand business” and “utility computing”  Downsizing – reducing the number of employees to cut costs 1.3 Reengineering and Continuous Improvement Reengineering, which is also known as “Process redesign” or “Business Process Reengineering (BPR)”, is the radical redesign of business processes, organisational structures, information systems and values of the organisation to achieve a breakthrough in business results. Continuous Improvement is to constantly seek ways to improve business processes and add value to products and services. Business Process Reengineering Continuous Improvement Strong action taken to solve serious problems Routine action taken to make major improvements Top-down change driven by senior executives Bottom-up change driven by workers Broad in scope, cuts across departments Narrow in scope, focus is on tasks in a given area Goal is to achieve a major breakthrough Goal is continuous, gradual improvements Often led by outsiders Usually led by workers close to the business Information system integral to the solution Information systems provide data to guide the improvement team 1.4 User Satisfaction and Technology Acceptance To be effective, reengineering and continuous improvement efforts must result in satisfied users and be accepted and used throughout the organisation. You can determine the actual usage of an information system by the amount of technology diffusion and infusion. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  Technology diffusion – a measure of how widely technology is spread throughout the organisation  Technology infusion – the extent to which technology is deeply integrated into an area or department 1.5 The Applications Portfolio A scheme for classifying information systems according to the contribution they make to the organisation. According to the applications portfolio, there are four types of systems: 1. Support (Support Application) – they make work more convenient but are not essential 2. Key Operational Applications – they are essential, without them the organisation could not conduct business 3. Strategic Application – it gives an organisation a competitive advantage 4. Future Strategic Application – these are ideas for systems which, if fully developed and deployed, might one day become strategic applications 1.6 Success Factors – Successfully Implemented Information Systems 1. Senior management must be committed to the development or purchase of the information system and support it fully 2. End-users of the system should be involved as early and as much as possible in the development or purchase of the system 3. Time must be taken to carefully determine what the system must do, something known as requirement engineering. Requirements must be clearly stated and understood and accepted by everyone involved 4. Strong project management in the development or purchase of the information system 2. Competitive Advantage A competitive advantage is the ability of an organisation to outperform its industry; that is, to earn a higher rate of profit than the industry norm. Factors that lead organisations to seek competitive Advantage: To be competitive, a company must be fast, nimble, flexible, innovative, productive, economical, and customer oriented. It must also align it’s IS strategy with general business strategies and objectives. Given the five forces model mentioned above, Porter and others have proposed a number of strategies to attain competitive advantage, as shown below:  Cost Leadership – deliver the lowest possible cost for products and services  Differentiation – deliver different products and services  Niche Strategy – deliver to only a small market  Altering the industry structure – change the industry to become more favourable to the company or organisation  Creating new products and services – introduce new products and services periodically or frequently  Improving existing product lines and services – make real improvements to existing product lines and services  Innovation – come up with new methods or ideas of providing products and services to the market  Other strategies – for example: being the first to market a new product Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 3. Evaluating Information Systems Once an information system has been implemented, management will want to assess how successful it has been in achieving its goals. They use methods such as the following to do so: 1. Productivity – a measure of the output achieved divided by the input required. Productivity = (Output / Input) * 100% 2. Return on Investment (ROI) – one measure of IS value that investigates the additional profits or benefits that are generated as a percentage of the investment in IS technology. Other measures of ROI includes the following: Earnings Growth  Market Share  Customer Awareness and Satisfaction  Total Cost of Ownership  Risk Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CHAPTER 3 Hardware: Input, Processing, Output and Storage Devices 1. Computer Systems: Integrating the Power of Technology People involved in selecting their organisation’s computer hardware must clearly understand current and future business requirements so that they can make informed acquisition decisions. Choosing the right computer hardware requires understanding its relationship to their information systems and the needs of an organisation. 1.1 Hardware components  Central Processing Unit (CPU) – the part of the computer that consists of three associated elements: the arithmetic/logic unit, the control unit, and the register areas o Arithmetic/Logic Unit – the part of the CPU that performs mathematical calculations and makes logical comparisons o Control Unit – the part of the CPU that sequentially accesses the program instructions, decodes them and coordinates the flow of data in and out of the ALU, the registers, the primary storage and even secondary storage and various output devices o Register – a high-speed storage area in the CPU used to temporarily hold small units of program instructions and data immediately before, during and after execution by the CPU  Primary Storage (main memory; memory) – the part of the computer that holds program instructions and data 2. Processing and Memory Devices: Power, Speed and Capacity The components responsible for processing – the CPU and memory – are housed together in the same box or cabinet, called the system unit. All other computer system devices, such as the monitor, secondary storage and keyboard, are linked directly or indirectly to the system unit housing. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 2.1 Processing Characteristics and Functions Because organisations want efficient processing and timely output, they use a variety of measures to gauge processing speed. These measures include the time it takes to complete machine cycle and clock speed  Machine Cycle Time – a computer executes an instruction during a machine cycle. The time in which a machine cycle occurs is measured in nanoseconds and picoseconds. Machine cycle time also can be measured by how many instructions are executed in one second. o MIPS – millions of instructions per second, a measure of machine cycle time  Clock Speed – a series of electronic pulses produced at a predetermined rate that affects machine cycle time o Megahertz (MHz) – millions of cycles per second, a measure of clock speed o Gigahertz (GHz) – billions of cycles per second, a measure of clock speed 2.2 Memory Characteristics and Functions Main memory is located physically close to the CPU, although not on the CPU chip itself. It provides the CPU with a working storage area of program instructions and data. The chief feature of memory is that it rapidly provides the data and instructions to the CPU. Types of Memory 1. Random Access Memory (RAM) – a form of memory in which instructions or data can be temporarily stored 2. Read-Only Memory (ROM) – a non-volatile form of memory 3. Cache Memory – a type of high-speed memory that a processor can access more rapidly than main memory 2.3 Multiprocessing The simultaneous execution of two or more instructions at the same time.  Coprocessor – the part of the computer that speeds processing by executing specific types of instructions while the CPU works on another processing activity.  Multicore microprocessor – a microprocessor that combines two or more independent processors into a single computer so that they share the workload and improve processing capacity 2.4 Parallel Computing The simultaneous execution of the same task on multiple processors to obtain results faster.  Massively Parallel Processing Systems – a form of multiprocessing that speeds processing by linking hundreds of thousands of processors to operate at the same time, or in parallel, with each processor having its own bus, memory, discs, copy of the operating system and applications.  Grid computing – the use of a collection of computers, often owned by multiple individuals or organisations, to work in a coordinated manner to solve a common problem Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 3. Secondary Storage Secondary Storage are devices that store large amounts of data, instructions and information more permanently than allowed with main memory. For most organisations, the best overall data storage solution is probably a combination of different secondary storage options. 3.1 Access Methods Data and information can be accessed using different methods such as the following:  Sequential access – a retrieval method in which data must be accessed in the order in which it was stored o The devices used only to access secondary storage data sequentially are called sequential access storage devices (SASDs)  Direct access – a retrieval method in which data can be retrieved without the need to read and discard other data o And those devices used for direct access are called direct access storage devices (DASDs) 3.2 Secondary Storage Devices Secondary data storage is not directly accessible by the CPU. Instead, computers usually use input/output channels to access secondary storage and transfer the desired data using intermediate areas in primary storage. The most common forms of secondary storage devices include the following:  Magnetic Secondary Storage Devices o Magnetic tape – a type of sequential secondary storage medium, now used primarily for storing backups of critical organisational data in the event of a disaster o Magnetic disc – a direct access storage device with bits represented by magnetised areas o Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disc (RAID) – a method of storing data that generates extra bits of data from existing data, allowing the system to create a “reconstruction map” so that, if a hard drive fails, the system can rebuild lost data o Disc mirroring – a process of storing data that provides an exact copy that protects users in the event of data loss o Virtual tape – a storage device for less frequently needed data so that it appears to be stored entirely on tape cartridges, although some parts of it might actually be located on faster hard discs  Optical Secondary Storage devices – they use special lasers to read and write data. They include the following: o Compact Disc Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) – a common form of optical disc on which data cannot be modified once it has been recorded o Digital Video Disc (DVD) – a storage medium used to store software, video games and movies  Solid State Secondary Storage Devices – they store data in memory chips rather than magnetic or optical media Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 3.3 Enterprise Storage Options Businesses need to store large amounts of data created throughout an organisation. Such large secondary storage is called enterprise storage and comes in the following three forms: 1. Attached storage – these methods includes the tape, hard discs and optical devices. They are connected directly to a single computer, they are simple and cost effective for single users and small groups but do not allow systems to share storage, therefore making it difficult to backup data 2. Network-attached storage (NAS) – hard disc storage that is set up with its own network address rather than being attached to a computer. It includes software to manage storage access and file management, relieving the users’ computers of those tasks. 3. Storage area networks (SAN) – a special-purpose, high-speed network that provides high- speed connections between data storage devices and computers over a network. A SAN also integrates different types of storage subsystems, such as multiple RAID storage devices and magnetic tape backup systems, into a single storage system. As organisations set up large-scale SANs, they use more computers and network connections than in a NAS environment and, consequently, the network becomes difficult to manage. In response, software tools designed to automate storage using previously defined policies are finding a place in the enterprise (known as policy-based storage management). Storage as a Service (SaaS) – a data storage model where a data storage service provider rents space to individuals and organisations. 4. Input and Output Devices: The Gateway to Computer Systems 4.1 Input Devices Data entry and input devices come in many forms, and some of them are as follows:  Personal Computer Input Devices (such as the keyboard)  Speech-Recognition Technology – input devices that recognise human speech  Digital cameras – an input device used with a PC to record and store images and video in digital form  Scanning Devices  Optical Data Readers  Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Devices  Magnetic Strip Cards – a type of card that stores a limited amount of data by modifying the magnetism of tiny iron-based particles contained on the card  Chip-and-PIN Cards – a type of card that employs a computer chip that communicates with a card reader using radio frequencies; it does not need to be swiped at a terminal  Contactless Cards – a card with an embedded chip that only needs to be held close to a terminal to transfer its data; no PIN needs to be entered  Point-of-Sale Devices – a terminal used to enter data into the computer system  Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Devices  Pen Input Devices  Touch-Sensitive Devices  Barcode Scanners Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  Radio Frequency Identification (RAID) – a technology that employs a microchip with an antenna to broadcast its unique identifier and location to receivers 4.2 Output Devices Computer systems provide output to decision makers at all levels of an organisation so they can solve a business problem or capitalise on a competitive opportunity. Below are some of the output devices used:  Display monitors – a device used to display the output from a computer, and comes in different forms: o Plasma display – a type of display using thousands of smart cells (pixels) consisting of electrodes and neon and xenon gases that are electrically turned into plasma to emit light o LCD display – flat display that uses liquid crystals – organic, oil-like material placed between two polarisers – to form characters and graphic images on a blacklit screen.  Printers and Plotters  Digital Audio Players – devices that can store, organise and play digital music  E-book Readers 5. Computer Systems Types 5.1 Portable Computers Portable computers are computers that are small enough to carry easily. They include the following:  Handheld computers – single-user computers that provides ease of portability because of its small size  Smartphones – handheld computers that combine the functionality of a mobile phone, camera, web browser, email tool, MP3 player and other devices into a single device  Laptop Computers – personal computers designed for use by mobile users, being small and light enough to sit comfortably on a user’s lap  Notebook Computers – smaller than laptops, and extremely lightweight computers that weigh less than 2kg and can easily fit in a briefcase  Netbook Computers – small, light, inexpensive member of the laptop computer family  Tablet Computers – portable, lightweight computers with no keyboard that allows you to roam the office, home or factory floor, carrying the device like a clipboard 5.2 Non-portable Single-User Computers Non-portable single-user computers include the following:  Thin Clients – low-cost, centrally managed computer with essential but limited capabilities and no extra drives (such as CD or DVD drives) or expansion slots  Desktop Computers – non-portable computers that fit on a desktop and provide sufficient computing power, memory and storage for most business computing tasks  Nettop Computers – inexpensive desktop computers designed to be smaller, lighter and consume much less power than a traditional desktop computer  Workstations – more powerful personal computers used for mathematical computing, computer-assisted design and other high end processing, but still small enough to fit on a desktop Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 5.3 Multiple-User Computer Systems Multiple-user computers are designed to support workgroups from a small department of two or three workers, to large organisations with tens of thousands of employees and millions of customers. They include the following:  Servers – computers employed by many users to perform a specific task, such as running network or Internet applications  Mainframe computers – large, powerful computers often shared by hundreds of concurrent users connected to the machine over a network  Supercomputers – the most powerful computer systems with the fastest processing speeds 6. Green Computing Green Computing is a program concerned with the efficient and environmentally responsible design, manufacture, operation, and disposal of IS-related products. This includes all types of computers, printers, and printer materials like toners and cartridges. Green Computing Goals: • Reduce the use of hazardous material • Allow companies to lower their power-related costs • Enable safe disposal or recycling of equipment Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CHAPTER 4 Software: Systems and Application Software 1. An Overview of Software Software has a profound impact on individuals and organisations as it can make a difference in profits and losses and between financial health and bankruptcy. Software consists of computer programs that control the workings of the computer hardware.  Computer programs – are sequences of instructions for the computer  Documentation – is the text that describes a program’s functions to help the user operate the computer system. Some documentation is given on-screen or online, while other forms appear in external resources such as printed manuals. There are two types of software: Systems software and Application Software (which will both be discussed in detail below) 1.1 Software Supporting Individuals, Group and Organisational Goals Every organisation relies on the contributions of people, groups and the entire enterprise to achieve its business objectives. One way of classifying the many potential uses of information systems is to identify the scope of the problems and opportunities that an organisation addresses. This scope is called the sphere of influence, and it’s divided into three: 1. Personal sphere of influence – the sphere of influence that serves the needs of an individual (e.g. Personal Productivity Software, that enables users to improve their personal effectiveness, increasing the amount of work and quality of work they can do) 2. Workgroup sphere of influence – the sphere of influence that helps workgroup members attain their common goals 3. Enterprise sphere of influence - the sphere of influence that serves the needs of the firm in its interaction with its environment The table below shows how various kinds of software supports these three spheres: Software Personal Workgroup Enterprise Systems Software Smartphone, tablet computer, personal computer and workstation operating systems Network operating systems Server and mainframe operating systems Application Software Word processing, spreadsheet, database and graphics Electronic mail, group scheduling, shared work and collaboration General ledger, order entry, payroll and human resources Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 2. Systems Software Systems software is the set of programs that coordinates the activities and functions of the hardware and other programs throughout the computer system. Systems software also supports the application programs’ problem-solving capabilities. Types of systems software includes the following: 2.1 Operating Systems (OS) An OS is a set of computer programs that controls the computer hardware and acts as an interface with applications. The various combinations of Oss, computers and users include the following:  Single computer with a single user  Single computer with multiple simultaneous users  Multiple computers with multiple users  Special-purpose computers The set of programs that make up the OS performs a variety of activities such as the following:  Performing common computer hardware functions  Providing a user interface and input/output management  Providing a degree of hardware independence  Managing system memory  Managing processing tasks  Sometimes providing networking capabilities  Controlling access to system resources  Managing files The kernel, is the heart of the OS and controls its most critical processes. The kernel ties all of the OS components together and regulates other programs. Common Hardware Functions All applications must perform certain hardware related tasks, such as the following:  Get input from the keyboard or another input device  Retrieve data from discs  Store data on discs  Display information on a monitor or printer Each of these tasks requires a detailed set of instructions. The OS converts a basic request into the instructions that the hardware requires. In effect, the OS acts as an intermediary between the application and the hardware. One of the most important functions of the OS is providing a user interface, which is the element of the OS that allows people to access and interact with the computer system. The first user interface for mainframe and personal computer systems were command based, referred to as Command- based user interface – which requires you to give text commands to the computer to perform basic activities. Then there was a Graphical User Interface (GUI) – which displays pictures (icons) and menus that people use to send commands to the computer system. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Software applications are designed to run on a particular OS by using the operating system’s application program interface (API), which provides software developers with tools they use to build application software without needing to understand the inner workings of the OS and hardware. The OS also controls how memory is accessed, maximizing the use of available memory and storage to provide optimum efficiency. Most OSs also support virtual memory, which allocates space on the hard disc to supplement the immediate, functional memory capacity of RAM. The task management features of the OS manage all processing activities. Task management allocates computer resources to make the best use of each system’s assets. Current Operating Systems Personal Workgroup Enterprise Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Server Microsoft Windows Server Mac OS X, Mac OS X iPhone Mac OS X Server Linux Linux Linux UNIX Google Android, Chrome OS UNIX IBM and z/OS HP webOS IBM I and z/OS HP-UX HP-UX 2.2 Utility programs Utility programs help to perform maintenance or correct problems with a computer system. Some utility programs merge and sorts’ data, keep track of computer jobs being run, compress files of data before they are sorted or transmitted over a network and perform other important tasks. Although many PC utility programs comes installed on computers, you can also purchase utility programs separately. The following are some common types of utility programs: 1. Hardware utilities 2. Security utilities 3. File-compression utilities 4. Spam-filtering utilities 5. Network and Internet utilities 6. Server and Mainframe utilities 2.3 Middleware Middleware is a software that allows various systems to communicate and exchange data. It is often developed to address situations where a company acquires different types of information systems through mergers, acquisitions or expansion and wants the systems to share data and interact. The use of middleware to connect disparate systems has evolved into an approach for developing software and systems called Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). SOA is a modular method of Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 developing software and systems that allows users to interact with systems and systems to interact with each other. Systems developed with SOA are flexible and ideal for businesses that need a system to expand and evolve over time. 3. Application Software Application software consists of programs that help users solve particular computing problems. In most cases, application software resides on the computer’s hard drive before it is brought into the computer’s memory and run. Its primary function is to apply the power of the computer to give people, workgroups and the entire enterprise the ability to solve problems and perform specific tasks. Proprietary and Off-the-shelf software are important types of application software. 1. Proprietary software – is one-of-a-kind software designed for a specific application and owned by the company, organisation or person that uses it. 2. Off-the-shelf software – software mass-produced by software vendors to address needs that are common across businesses, organisations or individuals Comparison of Proprietary and Off-the-shelf Software Proprietary Software Off-the-shelf Software Advantages Disadvantages Advantages Disadvantages You can get exactly what you need in terms of features, reports, and etc. It can take a long time and significant resources to develop required features The initial cost is lower because the software firm can spread the development costs over many customers An organisation might have to pay for features that are not required d never used Being involved in the development offers control over the results In-house system development staff may be hard pressed to provide the required level of ongoing support and maintenance because of pressure to move on to other new projects The software is likely to meet the basic business needs – you can analyse existing features and the performance of the package before purchasing The software might lack important features, thus requiring future modification or customisation. This lack can be very expensive because users must adapt future releases of the software as well You can modify features that you might need to counteract an initiative by competitors or to meet new supplier or customer demands The features and performance of software that has yet to be developed present more potential risk The package is likely to be in high quality because many customer firms have tested the software and helped identify its bugs The software might not match current work processes and data standards Another approach to obtaining a customised software package is to use an application service provider. An Application Service Provider (ASP) is a company that provides the software, support and computer hardware on which to run the software from the user’s facilities over a network. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Today, some organisations are running software on the web, this approach is called Software as a Service (SaaS). Personal Application Software includes the following:  Word-processing  Spreadsheet analysis  Database Applications  Presentation Graphics Program  Personal Information Managers  Software Suites and Integrated Software Packages Mobile Application Software categories includes the following:  Books and references  Games  Sports  News and Weather  Productivity and utilities and etc. Workgroup Application Software is software that supports teamwork, whether team members are in the same location or dispersed around the world. And these includes the following:  Group-scheduling software  Electronic mail and etc. Enterprise Application Software is software that benefits the entire organisation and can also be developed specifically for the business or purchased off the shelf. It also helps managers and workers stay connected. 4. Programming Languages Programming Languages are sets of keywords, commands, symbols and rules for constructing statements by which humans can communicate instructions to a computer. Each programming language uses symbols, keywords and commands that have special meanings and usage. Each language also has its own set of rules, called a syntax of the language. The language syntax dictates how the symbols, keywords and commands should be combined into statements capable of conveying meaningful instructions to the CPU. 5. Software Issues and Trends Issues:  Software Bugs – defects in a computer program that keeps it from performing as designed to perform.

Data Management and Data Modelling At the centre of every information system is a database, used to store data so that it can be processed to provide useful information. The most common type of database is a relationship database, so-named because the basic structure for storing data is a table, and the word relation is another name for a table. relational database is a series of related tables, stored together with a minimum of duplication to achieve consistent and controlled pool of data. A relational database is therefore made up of a number of tables, in loose terms each table stores the data about someone or something of interest to the organisation. This someone or something is known as an entity. An entity is a person, a place or thing about whom or about which an organisation wants to store data. The rows in a table collect together all the data about one specific entity. These rows are called records. A record is therefore a row in a table, containing data pertaining to one instance of an entity. The columns in a table are the specific items of data that get stored; and are called fields – characteristics, or attributes of an entity that is stored in the database. 1.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of the Database Approach Advantages Explanation Improved strategic use of corporate data Accurate, complete, up-to-date data can be made available to decision makers where, when, and in the form they need it. The database approach can also give greater visibility to the organisation’s resource Reduced data redundancy Data is organised by the database management system (DBMS) and stored in only one location. This results in more efficient use of system storage space Improved data integrity With the traditional approach, some changes to data were not reflected in all copies of the data kept in separate files. This is prevented with the database approach because no separate files contain copies of the same piece of data Easier modification and updating The DBMS coordinates updates and data modifications. Programmers and users do not have to know where the data is physically stored. Data is stored and modified once. Modification and updating is also easier because the data is stored in only one location in most cases Data and program independence The DBMS organises the data independently of the application program, so the application program is not affected by the location or type of data. Introduction of new data types not relevant to a particular application does not require rewriting that application to maintain compatibility with the data file Better access to data and information Most DBMSs have software that makes it easy to access Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 and retrieve data from a database. In most cases, users give simple commands to get important information. Relationships between records can be more easily investigated and exploited, and applications can be more easily combined Standardization of data access A standardised, uniform approach to database access means that all application programs use the same overall procedures to retrieve data and information A framework for program development Standardised database access procedures can mean more standardisation of program development. Because programs go through the DBMS to gain access to data in the database, standardised database access can provide a consistent framework for program development. Better overall protection of the data Accessing and using centrally located data is easier to monitor and control. Security codes and passwords can ensure that only authorised people have access to particular data and information in the database, thus ensuring privacy Shared data and information resources The cost of hardware, software and personnel can be spread over many applications and users. This is a primary feature of a DBMS Disadvantages Explanations More complexity DBMS can be difficult to set up and operate. Many decisions must be made correctly for the DBMS to work effectively. In addition, users have to learn new procedures to take full advantage of a DBMS More difficult to recover from a failure With the traditional approach to file management, a failure of a file affects only a single program. With a DBMS, a failure can shut down the entire database More expensive DBMS can be more expensive to purchase and operate. The expense includes the cost of the database and specialised personnel, such as a database administrator who is needed to design and operate the database. Additional hardware might also be required 1.2 Relationships between tables:  One-to-one relationship – obligatory on both sides  One-to-one relationship – optional on one side  One-to-one relationship – optional on both sides  One-to-many relationship – many side obligatory to one side  One to many relationship – many side optional to one side  Many-to-many relationship . Database Management Systems Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 A DBMS is a group of programs used as an interface between a database and application programs or between a database and the user. The capabilities and types of database systems, however, vary, but generally they provide the following:  Creating and Modifying the Database Schemas or designs are entered into the DBMS via a data definition language (DDL) – which is a collection of instructions and commands used to define and describe data and relationships in a specific database. A DDL allows the database’s creator to describe the data and relationships. Another important step in creating a database is to establish a data dictionary, which is a detailed description of all the data used in the database. The data dictionary describes all the fields in the database, their range of accepted values, the type of data, the amount of storage space needed for each and a note of who can access each and who updates each. A data dictionary helps achieve the advantages of the database approach in the following ways:  Reduced data redundancy – by providing standard definitions of all data, it is less likely that the same data item will be stored in different places under different names  Increased data reliability – a data dictionary and the database approach reduce the chance that data will be destroyed or lost  Assists program development – with data dictionary, programmers know what data is stored and what data type each field is. This information is valuable when writing programs that make use of the data  Easier modification of data and information – the data dictionary and the database approach make modifications to data easier because users do not need to know where the data is stored  Storing and Retrieving Data One function of a DBMS is to be an interface between an application program and the database. When an application needs data, it requests that data through the DBMS. Below is a diagram that shows how an application requests data from a DBMS: Two or more people or programs attempting to access the same record in the same database at the same time can cause a problem. However, concurrency control can be used to avoid this potential problem. Concurrency Control is a method of dealing with a situation in which two or more people need to access the same record at the same time. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  Manipulating Data and Generating Reports After a DBMS has been installed, employees, managers, and consumers can use it to review reports and obtain important information. Some databases use Query-by-Example (QBE), which is a visual approach to developing database queries or requests. Some use a Data Manipulation Language (DML), which are commands that are used to manipulate the data in a database. SQL commands can also be used in a computer program to query a database, which is convenient for programmers.  Data Administration Database systems require a skilled database administrator, which is someone whose role is to plan, design, create, operate, secure, monitor, and maintain databases. A DBA is expected to have a clear understanding of the fundamental business of the organisation, be proficient in the use of selected DBMSs and stay abreast of emerging technologies and new design approaches. Some organisations have also created the position called a data administrator – who is a non- technical position responsible for defining and implementing consistent principles for a variety of data issues.  Selecting a Database Management System The DBA often selects the DBMS for an organisation. The process begins by analysing database needs and characteristics. The information needs of the organisation affect the type of data that is collected and the type of DBMS that is used. Important characteristics of databases include the following:  Database size – the number of records or files in the database  Database cost – the purchase or lease costs of the database  Concurrent users – the number of people who need to use the database at the same time  Performance – how fast the database is able to update records  Integration – the ability to be integrated with other applications and databases  Vendor – the reputation and financial stability of the database vendor  Using Databases with Other Software DBMSs are often used with other software packages or the Internet. A DBMS can act as a front- end application or a back-end application. A front-end application is one that directly interacts with people or users, and a back-end application interacts with other programs or applications. 3. Database Applications Database applications manipulate the content of a database to produce useful information. Common manipulations are searching, filtering, synthesizing and assimilating the data contained in a database using a number of database applications. These applications allow users to link the company database to the Internet, set up data warehouses, use databases for strategic business intelligence, place data at different locations, use online processing and open connectivity standards for increased productivity, and search for and use unstructured data such as graphics, audio and video. 3.1 Linking databases to the Internet Linking databases to the internet is an incredibly useful application for organisations and individuals. Every e-commerce website uses database technology to dynamically create its web pages, saving vast amounts of efforts. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 3.2 Big Data Applications Much of the data that organisations store comes from their Transaction Processing Systems (TPS). However, organisations are frequently storing less well-structured data too, such as photos, videos, data from their own websites, including the order in which people view their webpages. All of this is called Big Data. Big data can provide valuable insights to help organisations achieve their goals, it can also reveal which potential customers are most likely to purchase which products. 3.3 Data Warehouses data warehouse is a database or collection of databases that collects business information from many sources in the enterprise, covering all aspects of the company’s processes, products, and customers. Elements of a data warehouse includes the following:  Data from TPS database  External databases  Click stream data from website  Department spreadsheets and databases  Data extraction and cleansing  Data warehouse  Query and analysis tools  Extremely rich and useful information 3.4 Data Mining Data mining is the process of analysing data to try to discover patterns and relationships within the data. Common data mining applications: Application Description Branding and positioning of products and services Enable the strategist to visualise the different positions of competitors in a given market using performance data on dozens of key features on the product and then to condense all that data into a perceptual map of only two or three dimensions Customer churn Predict current customers who are likely to switch to a competitor Direct marketing Identify prospects most likely to respond to a direct marketing campaign Fraud detection Highlight transactions most likely to be deceptive or illegal Market basket analysis Identify products and services that are most commonly purchased at the same time Market segmentation Group customers based on who they are or what they prefer Trend analysis Analyse how key variables vary over time Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 3.5 Business Intelligence BI is the process of gathering enough of the right information in a timely manner and usable form, and analysing it to have a positive impact on business strategy, tactics or operations. BI turns data into useful information that is then distributed through an organisation. Competitive intelligence is one of the aspects of business knowledge limited to information about competitors and the ways that knowledge affects strategy, tactics or operations. Counterintelligence is the steps an organisation takes to protect information sought by “hostile” intelligence gatherers. 3.6 Distributed Databases A database in which the data is spread across several smaller databases connected via telecommunications devices. 3.7 Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) OLAP is software that allows users to explore data from a number of perspectives. Comparison of OLAP and Data Mining: Characteristic OLAP Data Mining Purpose Supports data analysis and decision making Supports data analysis and decision making Type of analysis supported Top-down, query-driven data analysis Bottom-up, discovery-driven data analysis Skills required of user Must be very knowledgeable of the data and its business context Must trust in data-mining tools to uncover valid and worthwhile hypothesis Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CHAPTER 6 Computer Networks Telecommunications Telecommunications refers to the electronic transmission of signals for communications; enables organisations to carry out their processes and tasks through effective computer networks. Telecommunications impacts businesses greatly because it lessens the barriers of time and distance. Elements of a Telecommunications Systems: An important characteristic of telecommunications is the speed at which information is transmitted, which is measured in bits per second (bps). Advances in telecommunications technology allow us to communicate rapidly with clients and co-workers almost everywhere in the world. To use telecommunications effectively, you must carefully analyse telecommunications media and devices as below: 1.1 Channel Bandwidth Telecommunications channel bandwidth refers to the rate at which data is exchanged over a communications channel, usually measured in bps – the broader the bandwidth, the more information can be exchanged at one time. Broadband communications (which is a telecommunications system in which a very high rate of data exchange is possible) can exchange data very quickly, as opposed to narrow communications – which is a telecommunications system that supports a much lower rate of data exchange than broadband. 1.2 Guided Transmission Media Types Guided Media Types Media Type Description Advantage Disadvantage Twisted-pair wire Twisted pairs of copper wire, shielded or unshielded Used for telephone service; widely available Transmission speed and distance limitations Coaxial cable Inner conductor wire surrounded by insulation Cleaner and faster data transmission than More expensive than twisted-pair wire Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 twisted-pair wire Fibre-optic cable Many extremely thin strands of glass bound together in a sheathing; uses light beams to transmit signals Diameter of cable is much smaller than coaxial; less distortion of signal; capable of high transmission rates Expensive to purchase and install Broadband over power lines Data is transmitted over standard high-voltage power lines Can provide Internet service to rural areas where cable and phone services may be non- existent Can be expensive and may interfere with ham/amateur radios, and police and fire communications 1.3 Wireless Transmission Media Types Many technologies are used to transmit communications wirelessly. The major technologies include microwave, satellite, radio, and infrared. Their distinguishing feature is the frequency at which signals are transmitted.  Microwave transmission Microwave is a high-frequency signal sent through the air Typically, microwave stations are placed in a series – one station receives a signal, amplifies it and retransmits it to the next microwave transmission tower. A communications satellite also operates in the microwave frequency range. The satellite receives the signal from the Earth station, amplifies the relatively weak signal and then rebroadcasts it at a different frequency. The advantage of satellite communications is that it can receive and broadcasts over large geographic regions.

The 1G (first generation) of wireless communications standards originated in the 1980s and were based on analogue communications. The 2G (second generation) were fully digital networks that superseded 1G networks in the early 1990s. In 2G, phone conversations were encrypted, mobile phone usage was expanded and short message services (SMS), or texting was introduced. 3G (third generation) wireless communication supports voice and broadband data communications in a mobile environment at speeds of 2-4 Mbps. It also supports mobile video, e-commerce, location- based services, gaming and music.  4G Wireless Communications The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has defined 4G as a network that has meaningful improvement over 3G. 4G broadband mobile wireless is delivering enhanced versions of multimedia, smooth video streaming, universal access, and portability across all types of device and, eventually, world-wide roaming.  Wi-Fi A medium-range wireless telecommunications technology brand owned by the Wi-Fi Alliance. Wi-Fi typically operates up to about 30 metres around a single building. With a Wi-Fi network, the user’s computer, smartphone or tablet has a wireless adapter that translates data into a radio signal and transmits it using an antenna.  Near Field Communication (NFC) A very short-range wireless connectivity technology designed for consumer electronics, smartphones and credit cards.  Bluetooth A wireless communications specification that describes how smartphones, computers, printers and other electronic devices can be interconnected over distances of a few metres at a rate or about 2Mbps.  Ultra-Wideband (UWB) A form of short-range communication that employs extremely short electromagnetic pulses lasting 50 to 1000 picoseconds that are transmitted across a broad range of radio frequencies or several gigahertz.  Infrared Transmission Another mode of transmission, called infrared transmission, sends signals through the air via light waves at a frequency of 300 GHz and above. It requires line-of-sight transmission and short distances. 1.4 Telecommunications Hardware Telecommunications hardware devices includes modems, multiplexers and front-end processors.  Modems At different stages in the communications process, telecommunications often uses transmission media of different types and capacities. If you use an analogue line to transfer data, it can only accommodate an analogue signal (a variable signal continuous in both time and amplitude so that any small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful). Because a computer generates a digital signal representing bits, you need a special device to convert the digital signal to an analogue signal and vice versa. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  Multiplexers A multiplexer is a device that encodes from two or more data sources onto a single communications channel, thus reducing the number of communications channels needed and therefore lowering telecommunications costs.  Front-end Processor They are special-purpose computers that manage communications to and from a computer system serving hundreds of even thousands of users. They poll user devices to see if they have messages to send and facilitate efficient, error-free communications.  Private Branch Exchange (PBX) A PBX is a telephone switching exchange that serves a single organisation. It enables users to share a certain number of outside links to make telephone calls to people outside the organisation. This sharing reduces the organisation’s telephone costs.  Switches, Bridges, Routers, and Gateways switch is a telecommunications device that uses the physical device address in each incoming message on the network to determine to which output port it should forward the message to reach another device on the same network. bridge is a telecommunications device that connects one LAN to another LAN that uses the same telecommunications protocol. router is a telecommunications device that forwards data packets across two or more distinct networks towards their designations, through a process known as routing. gateway is a telecommunications device that serves as an entrance to another network. 2. Networks and Distributed Processing A computer network consists of communications media, devices and software needed to connect two or more computer systems and/or devices. The computers and devices on the networks are called “network nodes”. Organisations ca use networks to share hardware, programs, and databases. They transmit and receive information to improve organisational effectiveness and efficiency. 2.1 Network Types Depending on the physical distance between nodes on a network and the communications and services it provides, networks can be classified as personal area, local area, metropolitan area or wide area.  Personal Area Networks (PAN) – is a network that supports the interconnection of information technology within a range of ten metres or so. One computer serves as the controller during wireless PAN initialisation, and this controller device mediates communication within the PAN.  Local Area Networks (LAN) – is a network that connect computer systems and devices within a small area, such as an office, home, or several floors in a building.  Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) – is a telecommunications network that connects users and their devices in a geographical area that spans a campus or a city.  Wide Area Networks (WAN) – a telecommunications network that ties together large geographic regions. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  International Networks – a network that links users and systems in more than one country. Some of the challenges that comes with international networks include the fact that they require sophisticated equipment and software, they must also meet specific national and international laws regulating the electronic flow of data across international boundaries.  Mesh Networking – is a way to route communications between network nodes (computers or other devices) by allowing for continuous connections and reconfigurations around blocked paths by “hopping” from node to node until a connection can be established. 2.2 Distributed Processing When an organisation needs to use two or more computer systems, it can use one of three basic processing alternatives: centralised, decentralised, or distributed. With centralised processing, all processing occurs in a single location or facility. This approach offers the highest degree of control because a single centrally managed computer performs all data processing. With decentralised processing, processing devices are placed at various remote locations. Each computer system is isolated and does not communicate with another system. Decentralised systems are suitable for companies that have independent operating divisions. With distributed processing, computers are placed at remote locations but connected to each other via telecommunications devices. One benefit of distributed processing is that managers can allocate data to the locations that can process it most efficiently. 2.3 Client/Server Processing Users can share data through file server computing, which allows authorised users to download entire files from certain computers designated as file servers. In client/server architecture, multiple computer platforms are dedicated to special functions such as database management, printing, communications, and program execution. These platforms are called servers. Each server is accessible by all computers on the network. The server distributes programs and data to the other computers (clients) on the network as they requests them. A client is any computer that sends messages requesting services from the servers on the network. A client can converse with many servers concurrently. 2.4 Communications Software A network operating system (NOS) is systems software that controls the computer systems and devices on a network and allows them to communicate with each other. The NOS performs the same types of functions for the network as operating system software does for a computer, such as memory, and task management and coordination of hardware. Software tools and utilities are available for managing networks. With network-management software, a manager on a network can monitor the use of individual computers and shared hardware (such as printers), scan for viruses and ensure compliance with software licenses. Network-management software also simplifies the process of updating files and programs on computers on the network – a manager can make changes through a communications server instead of on individual computers. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 2.5 Securing Data Transmission The interception of confidential information by unauthorised individuals can compromise private information about employees or customers, reveal marketing or new product development plans, or cause organisational embarrassment. Organisations with widespread operations need a way to maintain the security of communications with employees and business partners, wherever their facilities are located. Encryption of data is one approach taken to protect the security of communications over both wired and wireless networks. Encryption is the process of converting an original message into a form that can be understood only by the intended receiver. An encryption key is a variable that is applied (using an algorithm) to a set of unencrypted text or to decrypt encrypted text.  Securing Wireless Networks WEP and WPA are the two main approaches to securing wireless networks such as wi-fi and WiMAX. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) used to use encryption based on 64-bit key, which has been upgraded to a 128-bit key. WEP represents an early attempt at securing wireless communications and is not difficult for hackers to crack. The following steps, while not foolproof, help safeguard a wireless network: 1. Connect to the router and change the default logon and password for the router 2. Create a service set identifier (SSD). This is a 32-character unique identifier attached to the header portion of packets sent over a wireless network that differentiates one network from another 3. Configure the security to WPA. Surprisingly, many routers are shipped with encryption turned off 4. Disable SSID broadcasting 5. Configure each wireless computer on the network to access the network by setting the security to WPA and entering the same password entered on the router 2.6 Virtual Private Network (VPN) A virtual private network (VPN) is a private network that uses a public network (usually the Internet) to connect multiple remote locations. A VPN provides network connectivity over a potentially long physical distance and thus can be considered a form of wide area network. VPNs support secure, encrypted connections between a company’s employees and remote users through a third- party service provider. 3. The Internet The Internet is the world’s largest computer network. Actually, the Internet is a collection of interconnected networks, all freely exchanging information. The internet is truly international in scope, with users on every continent. The ancestor of the Internet was the ARPANET – which was a project started by the US department of Defense (DoD) in 1969 as both an experiment in reliable networking and a means to link DoD and military research contractors, including many universities doing military-funded research. An Internet Protocol (IP) is a communication standard that enables traffic to be routed from one network to another as needed. How the Internet Works The internet transmits data from one computer (called a host) to another. If the receiving computer is on a network to which the first computer is directly connected, it can send the message directly. If the receiving and sending Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 computers are not directly connected to the same network, the sending computer relays the message to another computer which forwards it on. The message might be sent through a router to reach the forwarding computer. The forwarding host, which needs to be attached to at least one other network, delivers the message directly if it can or passes it to another forwarding host. A message can pass through a dozen or more forwarders on its way from one part of the Internet to another. The set of conventions used to pass packets from one host to another is known as the Internet Protocol (IP). Many other protocols are used in connection with IP. Such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) – which is the widely used transport-layer protocol that most internet applications used with IP. After a network following these standards links to a backbone – which is one of the internet’s high speed, long-distance communications links – it becomes part of the worldwide internet community. There is also an Internet Service Provider (ISP) which is any company that provides people or organisations with access to the Internet. 4. Internet Applications Many people believe that the Internet and the World Wide Web are synonymous. However, the web, is just one application of the internet. 4.1 The World Wide Web Is a collection of tens of thousands of independently owned computers that work together as one in an internet service? The web is a menu-based system that uses the client/server model. Data can exist on the web as ASCII characters, word-processing files, audio files, graphic and video images, or any other sort of data that can be stored in a computer file. A website is like a magazine, with a cover page called a homepage which includes links to the rest of its material. The words on a website are typically written in hypertext. Hypertext allows the linking of certain words to other web pages, so users can click on them to access related material. Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML), is the standard page description language for web pages. And HTML tags refer to codes that let the web browser know how to format text – as a heading, as a list, or as body text – and whether images, sound or other elements should be inserted. web browser translates HTML so you can read it. It provides a graphical interface to the web. The menu consists of graphics, titles, and text with hypertext links. Looking for information on the web is like browsing in a library – without the alphabetic listing of books in the card catalogue, it is difficult to find information. Web search tools – called search engines – take the place of the card catalogue. 4.2 Email Email or electronic mail is a method of sending communications over computer networks. It is no longer limited to simple text messages. Depending on your hardware and software, and the hardware and software of your recipient, you can embed sound and images in your message and attach files that contain text documents, spreadsheets, graphics, or executable programs. 4.3 Telnet and FTP Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Telnet is a terminal emulation protocol that enables you to log on to other computers on the Internet to gain access to their publicly available files. Telnet is particularly useful for perusing library holdings and large databases. It is also called “remote logon”. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a protocol that describes a file transfer process between a host and a remote computer. Using FTP, users can copy files from one computer to another. 4.4 Cloud Computing Cloud computing refers to a computing environment where software and storage are provided as an Internet service and accessed with a web browser. Cloud computing offers many advantages to companies. By outsourcing business information systems to the cloud, a business saves on system design, installation and maintenance. No universally accepted standard exists yet for cloud computing, and managing applications can be difficult when many providers are involved. 5. Intranets and Extranets An intranet is an internal company network built using Internet and World Wide Web standards and products. Employees of an organisation use it to gain access to company information. A big advantage of using an intranet is that many people are already familiar with Internet technology, so they need little training to make effective use of their corporate intranet. An intranet is an inexpensive yet powerful alternative to other forms of internal communication, including conventional computer setups. One of an intranet’s most obvious virtues is its ability to reduce the need for paper. An intranet provides employees with an easy and intuitive approach to accessing information that was previously difficult to obtain. A rapidly growing number of companies offer limited access to their intranet to selected customers and suppliers. Such networks are referred to as extranets, and connect people who are external to the company. An extranet is a network that links selected resources of the intranet of a company with its customers, suppliers or other business partners.

Many organisations recognised that their existing systems lacked the integration needed to coordinate these activities and also to share valuable information across all the business functions of the firm. An ERP is a system that manages an entire company’s vital business information. Many firms consider themselves to have an ERP if the system manages most, rather than all, of their information. 1.1 Advantages of ERP Systems  Improved access to data for operational decision making  Elimination of costly, inflexible legacy systems  Improvement of work processes  Upgrade of technology infrastructure 1.2 Disadvantages of ERP Systems  Expense and time in implementation  Difficulty implementing change  Difficulty integrating with other systems  Difficulty in loading data into new ERP system  Risks in using one vendor  Risk of implementing failure Implementing an ERP system for a large organisation is extremely challenging and requires tremendous amounts of resources. However, the following list provides tips for avoiding many common causes for failed ERP implementations: Assign a full-time executive to manage the project 2. Appoint an experienced, independent resource to provide project oversight and to verify and validate system performance 3. Allow sufficient time for transition from the old way of doing things to the new system and new processes 4. Plan to spend a lot of time and money training people 5. Define metrics to assess project progress and to identify project-related risks 6. Keep the scope of the project well defined and contained to essential business processes 7. Be wary of modifying the ERP software to conform to your firm’s business practices 1.3 ERP for Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) It is not only large companies that are successful in implementing ERP. SMEs (both for-profit and not-for- profit) can achieve real business benefits from their ERP efforts. Many of the SMEs elected to implement open-source ERP systems. With open-source software, anyone can see and modify the source code to customize it to meet their needs. Such systems are much less costly to acquire and are relatively easy to modify to meet business needs. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Below is a list of some of the open-source ERP systems geared for SMEs: Vendor: ERP Solutions: Apache Open for Business ERP Compiere Compiere Open Source ERP Openbravo Openbravo Open Source ERP WebERP WebERP 2. Transaction Processing Systems Every organisation has many transaction processing systems (TPS). These systems include:  order processing  inventory control  payroll  accounts payable  accounts receivable  general ledger amongst others The input to these systems includes basic business transactions, such as a customer placing an order, an employee purchasing supplies, a customer payment and an employee signing on and off at the start and end of a day. The processing activities include data collection, data editing, data correction, data manipulation, data storage, and document production. The result of processing business transactions is that the organisation’s records are updated to reflect the status of the operation at the time of the last processed transaction. TPS support routine operation in the business. The amount of support for decision making that a TPS directly provides managers and workers is low. 2.1 Traditional Transaction Processing Methods and Objectives With batch processing systems, business transactions are accumulated over a period of time and prepared for processing as a single unit or batch. Transactions are accumulated for the appropriate length of time needed to meet the needs of the users of that system. The essential characteristic of a batch processing system is that there is some delay between an event and the eventual processing of the related transaction to update the organisation’s records. With online transaction processing (OLTP), each transaction is processed immediately, without the delay of accumulating transactions into a batch. Consequently, at any time, the data in an online system reflects the current status. This type of processing is essential for businesses that require access to current data such as airlines, ticket agencies, and stock investment firms. Because of the importance of transaction processing, organisations expect their TPS to accomplish a number of specific objectives, some of which are as follows:  Process data generated by and about transactions  Maintain a high degree of accuracy and integrity  Avoid processing fraudulent transactions  Produce timely user responses and reports  Increase labour efficiency  Help improve customer service  Help build and maintain customer loyalty  Achieve competitive advantage Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Depending on the specific nature and goals of the organisation, any of these objectives might be more important than others. 2.2 Transaction Processing Activities TPS capture and process data of fundamental business transactions. This data is used to update databases and to produce a variety of reports people both within and outside the enterprise can use. The business data goes through a transaction processing cycle that includes the following:  Data collection – capturing and gathering all data necessary to complete the processing of transactions  Data Editing – the process of checking data for validity and completeness  Data Correction – the process of re-entering data that was not typed or scanned properly  Data manipulation – the process of performing calculations and other data transformations related to business transactions  Data storage – the process of updating one or more databases with new transactions  Document production – involves generating output records, documents and reports 3. Traditional Transaction Processing Applications This section presents an overview of several common transaction processing systems that support the order processing, purchasing and accounting business functions: Order Processing Purchasing Accounting Order processing Inventory control (raw materials, packing materials, spare parts and supplies) Budget Sales configuration Accounts receivable Shipment planning Payroll Shipment execution Purchase order processing Asset management Inventory control (finished product) Receiving General ledger Accounts receivable Accounts payable 3.1 Order Processing Systems The traditional TPS for order processing include order entry, sales configuration, shipment planning, shipment execution, inventory control and accounts receivable. Running these systems efficiently and reliably is critical to an enterprise. 3.2 Purchasing Systems The traditional TPS that supports the purchasing business function includes inventory control, purchase order processing, receiving and accounts payable. 3.3 Accounting Systems The primary accounting system include budget, accounts receivable and payable payroll, asset management and general ledger.

Electronic and Mobile Commerce 4.1 Electronic Commerce Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is conducting business transactions (e.g. distribution, buying, selling, and servicing) electronically over computer networks such as the Internet, extranets and corporate networks. An e- commerce system is a type of transaction processing system. Business activities that are strong candidates for conversation to e-commerce are paper-based, time consuming and inconvenient for customers Below are some types of e-commerce:  Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce – a form of e-commerce in which customers deal directly with an organisation and avoids intermediaries  B2Me e-commerce – a form of e-commerce where the business treats each customer as a separate market segment. Typical B2Me features include customising a website for each customer, perhaps based on their previous purchases and personalised marketing literature  Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce – a subset of e-commerce where all the participants are organisations  Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce – a subset of e-commerce that involves consumers selling directly to other consumers  E-government – is the use of information and communications technology to simplify the sharing of information, speed up formerly paper-based processes and improve the relationship between citizen and government 4.2 Mobile Commerce Mobile commerce (m-commerce) relies on the use of wireless devices, such as personal digital assistants, mobile phones and smartphones, to transact. For m-commerce to work effectively, the interface between the wireless device and its user needs to improve to the point that it is nearly as easy to purchase an item on a wireless device as it is to purchase it on a home computer. In addition, network speed must improve so that users do not become frustrated. Security is also a major concern, particularly in two areas:  the security of the transaction itself and  the trust that the transaction is being made with the intended party Encryption can provide secure transmission. Digital certificates can ensure that transactions are made between the intended parties. 5. Customer Relationship Management and Sales Ordering A customer relationship management (CRM) system helps a company manage all aspects of customer encounters, including marketing and advertising, sales, customer service after the sale and programmes to retain loyal customers. The goal of CRM is to understand and anticipate the needs of current and potential customers to increase customer retention and loyalty while optimising the way that products and services are sold. Businesses implementing CRM systems report business benefits such as improved customer satisfaction, increased customer retention, reduced operating costs and the ability to meet customer demand. CRM software automates and integrates the functions of sales, marketing and service in an organisation. The objective is to capture data about every contact a company has with a customer through every channel, and store it in the CRM system so the company can truly understand customer actions. CRM systems helps an organisation build a database about its customers that describes relationships in sufficient detail so that management, salespeople, customer service providers – and even customers – can access information to match customer needs with products they have purchased. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Sales ordering is the set of activities that must be performed to capture a customer sales order. A few of the essential steps include recording the items to be purchased, setting the sales price, recording the order quantity, determining the total cost of the order including delivery costs and confirming the customer’s available credit. 6. Financial and Managerial Accounting The general ledger is the main accounting record of a business. It is often divided into different categories including the following:  Assets  Liabilities  Revenue  Expenses  Equity These categories, in turn are subdivided into sub-ledgers to capture details such as cash, accounts payable, accounts receivable and etc. In an ERP system, input to the general ledger occurs simultaneously with the input of a business transaction to a specific module. Here are several examples of how this occurs:  An order administrator records a sales, and the ERP system automatically creates an accounts receivable entry indicating that a customer owes money for goods received  A buyer enters a purchase order, and the ERP system automatically creates an accounts payable entry in the general ledger registering that the company has an obligation to pay for goods that will be received at some time in the future  A dock worker enters a receipt of purchased materials from a supplier, and the ERP system automatically creates a general ledger entry to increase the value of inventory on hand  A production worker withdraws raw materials from inventory to support production, and the ERP system generates a record to reduce the value of inventory on hand 7. International Issues Associated with Operational Systems Operational systems must support businesses that transact with customers, suppliers, business partners, shareholders and government agencies in multiple countries. Different languages and cultures, disparities in IS infrastructure, varying laws and customs rules, and multiple currencies are among the challenges that must be met by an operational system of a multinational company. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CHAPTER 8 Management Information and Decision Support Systems Decision Making and Problem Solving Organisations need to make good decisions. In most cases, strategic planning and the overall goals of the organisation set the course for decision making, helping employees and business units achieve their objectives and goals. Problem solving is a critical activity for any business organisation. After identifying a problem, you begin the problem-solving process with decision making. A well-known model developed by Herbert Simon divides the decision-making phase into three stages: 1. Intelligence – the first stage of decision making in which potential problems or opportunities are identified and defined 2. Design – the second stage of decision making in which alternative solutions to the problem are developed 3. Choice – the third stage of decision making which requires selecting a course of action This model was later incorporated by George Huber into an expanded model of the entire problem solving process, where the three stages of decision making are augmented by the following to result in problem solving: 4. Implementation – a stage of problem solving in which a solution is put into effect 5. Monitoring – the final stage of the problem-solving process in which decision makers evaluate the implementation 1 Programmed vs Non-Programmed Decisions Programmed Decisions Non-Programmed Decisions A decision made using a rule, procedure or quantitative method A decision that deals with unusual or exceptional situations that can be difficult to quantify Easy to computerise using traditional information systems Contain unique characteristics, and standard rules or procedures might not apply to them Structured and deal with routine, well-defined decisions Unstructured problems that are not routine, and rules and relationships are not well-defined 1.2 Optimisation, Satisficing and Heuristic Approaches In general, computerized decision support systems can either optimize or satisfice. An optimisation model finds the best solution, usually the one that will best help the organisation meet its goals. Optimisation models use problem constraints. Optimisation software also allows decision makers to explore various alternatives. satisficing model, is one that will find a good – but not necessarily the best – problem solution. Satisficing is usually used because modelling the problem properly to get an optimal decision would be too difficult, complex or costly. Satisficing normally does not look at all possible solutions but only at those likely to give good results. Heuristics, often referred to as “rules of thumb” – commonly accepted guidelines or procedures that usually find a good solution – are often used in decision making. 1.3 Sense and Respond Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Sense and Respond (SaR) involves determining problems or opportunities (sense) and developing systems to solve the problems or take advantage of the opportunities (respond). SaR often requires nimble organisations that replace traditional lines of authority with those that are flexible and dynamic. 1.4 Big Data The amount of data that some companies are currently collecting is becoming so huge that it is difficult to process using traditional database technology. This phenomenon is referred to as Big Data. Big Data is of interest because of the additional insight it can offer into customer behaviour, logistics, factory design and a host of other applications. Big Data involves new ways of capturing data, processing it and visualising the patterns and trends in it. . An Overview of Management Information Systems A management information system (MIS) is an integrated collection of people, procedures, databases, hardware and software that provides managers and decision makers with information to help achieve organisational goals. The primary purpose of an MIS is to help an organisation achieve its goals by providing managers with insight into the regular operations of the organisation so that they can control, organise, and plan more effectively. One important role of an MIS is to provide the right information to the right person in the right format at the right time. Therefore, an MIS provides managers with information, typically reports, that supports effective decision making and provides feedback on daily operations. 2.1 Input to a Management Information System Data that enters an MIS originates from both internal and external sources, including the company’s supply chain. The most significant internal data source of an MIS are the organisation’s various TPS and ERP systems. External sources of data can include customers, suppliers, competitors, and stakeholders whose data is not already captured by the TPS, as well as other sources such as the Internet. The MIS uses the data obtained from these sources and processes it into information more usable by managers, primarily in the form of predetermined reports. 2.2 Output of a Management Information System 1. Scheduled reports – reports produced periodically, or on a schedule, such as daily, weekly, or monthly 2. Key-Indicator report – a summary of the previous day’s critical activities; typically available at the beginning of each workday 3. Demand reports – reports developed to give certain information at someone’s request 4. Exception reports – reports automatically produced when a situation is unusual or requires management action 5. Drill-down reports – reports that provide increasingly detailed data about a situation 2.3 Characteristics of an MIS In general, MIS perform the following functions:  Provide reports with fixed and standard formats  Produce hard-copy and soft-copy reports  Use internal data stored in the computer system  Allow users to develop their own custom reports Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  Require users to submit formal requests for reports to systems personnel 3. Financial MIS 3.1 Financial Management Information Systems A Financial MIS provides financial information not only for executives but also for a broader set of people who need to make better decisions on a daily basis. Financial MISs are used to streamline reports of transactions. Most financial MIS perform the following functions:  Integrate financial and operational information from multiple sources, including the Internet, into a single system  Provide easy access to data for both financial and non-financial users, often through the use of a corporate intranet to access corporate web pages of financial data and information  Make financial data immediately available to shorten analysis turnaround time  Enable analysis of financial data along multiple dimensions – time, geography, product, plant, customer  Analyse historical and current financial activity  Monitor and control the use of funds over time 3.2 Manufacturing Management Information Systems The success of an organisation can depend on the manufacturing function. Some common information subsystems and outputs used in manufacturing are as follows:  Design and engineering  Master production scheduling and inventory control  Process control  Quality control and testing 3.3 Marketing Management Information Systems A marketing MIS is an information system that supports managerial activities in product development, distribution, pricing decisions and promotional effectiveness. Subsystems for the marketing MIS include the following:  Marketing research  Product development  Promotion and advertising  Product pricing  Sales analysis The subsystems and their outputs help marketing managers and executives increase sales, reduce marketing expenses and develop plans for future products and services to meet the changing needs of customers. 3.4 Human Resource Management Information Systems A human resource MIS (HRMIS) is an information system that is concerned with activities related to employees and potential employees of an organisation, also called a personnel MIS. Human resource subsystems and outputs range from the determination of human resource needs and hiring through retirement and outplacement. Most medium and large organisations have computer systems to assist with the following:  Human resource planning  Personnel selection and recruiting  Training and skills inventory Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  Scheduling and job placement  Wage and salary administration 3.5 Geographic Information Systems Although not yet common in organisations, a geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system capable of assembling, storing, manipulating and displaying geographic information; that is, data identified according to its location. A GIS enables users to pair maps or map outlines with tabular data to describe aspects of a particular geographic region. 4. Decision Support Systems (DSS) Management information systems provide useful summary reports to help solve structured and semi- structured business problems. DSSs offer the potential to assist in solving both semi-structured and unstructured problems. A DSS is an organised collection of people, procedures, software, databases and devices used to help make decisions that solve problems. 4.1 Characteristics of a DSS  Provide rapid access to information  Handle large amounts of data from different sources  Provide report and presentation flexibility  Offer both external and graphical orientation  Support drill-down analysis  Perform complex, sophisticated analysis and comparisons using advanced software packages  Support optimisation, satisficing and heuristic approaches  Perform goal-seeking analysis  Performing simulation 4.2 Capabilities of a DSS A single DSS might provide only a few of these capabilities, depending on its uses and scope:  Support for problem-solving phases  Support for different decision frequencies  Support different problem structures  Support for various decision-making levels 4.3 A Comparison of a DSS and an MIS Factor DSS MIS Problem type A DSS can handle unstructured problems that cannot be easily programmed An MIS is normally used only with structured problems Users A DSS supports individuals, small groups and the entire organisation. In the short run, users typically have more control over a DSS An MIS supports primarily the organisation. In the short run, users have less control over an MIS Support A DSS supports all aspects and phases of decision making; it does not replace the This is not true for all MIS systems – some make automatic decisions and Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 decision maker – people still make the decisions replace the decision maker Emphasis approach A DSS emphasises actual decisions and decision-making styles. A DSS is a direct support system that provides interactive reports on computer screens An MIS usually emphasises information only. An MIS is typically and indirect support system that uses regularly produced reports Speed Because a DSS is flexible and can be implemented by users, it usually takes less time to develop and is better able to respond to user requests An MIS’s response time is usually longer Output DSS reports are usually screen oriented, with the ability to generate reports on a printer An MIS typically is oriented towards printed reports and documents Development DSS users are usually more directly involved in its development. User involvement usually means better systems that provide superior support. For all systems, user involvement is the most important factor for the development of a successful system An MIS is frequently several years old and often was developed for people who are no longer performing the work supported by the MIS 4.4 Components of a DSS At the core of a DSS are a database and a model base. In addition, a typical DSS contains a user interface, also called dialogue manager that allows decision makers to easily access and manipulate the DSS and to use common business terms and phrases.  The Database – the database management system allows managers and decision makers to perform qualitative analysis on the company’s vast stores of data in the database and data warehouses. A database management system can also connect to an external database to give managers and decision makers even more information and decision support.  The Model Base – it is part of a DSS that provides decision makers with access to a variety of models and assists them in decision making. The model base gives decision makers access to a variety of models so that they can explore different scenarios and see their effects. The models and algorithms used in a DSS are often reviewed and revised over time. Model management software (MMS) is often used to coordinate the use of models in a DSS, including financial, statistical analysis, graphical and project management models, see below: Model Type Description Software Financial Provides cash flow, internal rate of return and other investment analysis Spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Statistical Provides summary statistics, trend projections, hypothesis testing and more Statistical program, such as SPSS or SAS Graphical Assists decision makers in designing, developing and using graphic displays of data and information Graphics programs, such as Microsoft PowerPoint Project Management Handles and coordinates large projects; also used to identify critical activities and tasks that could delay or jeopardise an entire project if they are not Project management software, such as Microsoft Project Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 completed in a timely and cost effective fashion  The user interface or Dialogue Manager – it allows users to interact with the DSS to obtain information. It assists with all aspects of communications between the user and the hardware and software that constitute the DSS. 5. Group Support Systems (GSS) A GSS is a software application that consists of most elements in a DSS, plus software to provide effective support in group decision making; also called “group decision support system”. GSSs are used in most industries; for example architects use them to help them collaborate with other architects and builders to develop the best plans and to compete for contracts. 5.1 Characteristics of a GSS that Enhance Decision Making 1. Design for groups 2. Ease of use 3. Flexibility 4. Decision-making support 5. Anonymous input 6. Reduction of negative group behaviour 7. Parallel communication 8. Automated recordkeeping 6. Executive Support Systems (ESS) An ESS is a specialised DSS that includes all hardware, software, data, procedures, and people used to assist senior- level executives within the organisation. An ESS was developed because top-level executives often require specialised support when making strategic decisions. General characteristics of an ESS includes the following: 1. They are tailored to individual executives 2. They are easy to use 3. They have drill-down abilities 4. They support the need for external data 5. They can help with situations that have a high degree of uncertainty 6. They have a future orientation 7. They are linked with value-added business processes 6.1 Capabilities of Executive Support Systems The responsibility given to top-level executives and decision makers brings unique problems and pressures to their jobs. ESSs take full advantage of data mining, the Internet, blogs, podcasts, executive dashboards and many other technological innovations. An effective ESS should have the capability to support executive decisions with components such as strategic planning and organising, crisis management and more. Below are some capabilities of an ESS: Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  Support for defining an overall vision  Support for strategic planning – strategic planning involves determining long-term objectives by analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the organisation, predicting future trends and projecting the development of new product lines  Support for strategic organising and staffing  Support for strategic control  Support for crisis management Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CHAPTER 9 Knowledge Management and Specialised Information Systems Knowledge Management Systems Defining knowledge is difficult – but one way of defining knowledge is to say that it is the awareness and understanding of a set of information and the ways that information can be made useful to support a specific task or reach a decision. Information tells you what has to be done, while knowledge tells you how to do it. knowledge management system (KMS) is an organised collection of people, procedures, software, databases and devices used to create, store, share and use the organisation’s knowledge and experience. KMSs attempt to help organisations achieve their goals. They also store and process knowledge. This can either be Explicit or Tacit knowledge. Explicit knowledge is objective and can be measured and documented in reports, papers and rules. While Tacit knowledge on the other hand, is hard to measure and document and typically is not objective or formalised. Knowledge can be created in the following four ways: 1. When an individual learns directly from another individual, in an apprentice type relationship, tacit knowledge is created from tacit knowledge 2. When two pieces of explicit knowledge are combined. For example, a website mash-up could be considered an example of this type of new knowledge 3. When an expert writes a book teaching others, explicit knowledge is being created from tacit knowledge 4. When someone reads that book and (eventually) becomes an expert themselves, tacit knowledge has been created by explicit knowledge Knowledge workers are people who create, use and disseminate knowledge. They are usually professionals in science, engineering or business, and belong to professional organisations. Other examples of knowledge workers include writers, researchers, educators and corporate designers. The Chief Knowledge Officer (CKO) is a top-level executive who helps the organisation work with a KMS to create, store, and use knowledge to achieve organisational goals. 1.1 Technology to Support Knowledge Management: An effective KMS is based on learning new knowledge and changing procedures and approaches as a result. E.g. A manufacturing company might learn new ways to program robots on the factory floor to improve accuracy and reduce defective parts. The new knowledge will likely cause the manufacturing company to change how it programs and uses its robots. Microsoft offers a number of knowledge management tools, including Digital Dashboard, based on the Microsoft Office suite. Digital Dashboard integrates information from different sources, including personal, group, enterprise and external information and documents. . Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence (AI) include the people, procedures, hardware, software, data and knowledge needed to develop computer systems and machines that demonstrate characteristics of intelligence. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 2.1 The Nature of Intelligence From the early AI pioneering stage, the research emphasis has been on developing machines with intelligent behaviour. Some specific characteristics of intelligent behaviour include the ability to do the following:  Learn from experiences and apply knowledge acquired from experience,  Handle complex situations  Solve problems when important information is missing  Determine what is important  React quickly and correctly to a new situation  Understand visual images  Process and manipulate symbols  Be creative and imaginative  Use heuristics. 2.2 The difference between Natural and Artificial Intelligence Ability to: Natural Intelligence (Human) Artificial Intelligence (Machine) Low High Low High Use sensors (see, hear, touch, smell) √ √ Be creative and imaginative √ √ Learn from experience √ √ Adapt to new situations √ √ Afford the cost of acquiring intelligence √ √ Acquire a large amount of external information √ √ Use a variety of information sources √ √ Make complex calculations √ √ Transfer information √ √ Make a series of calculations rapidly and accurately √ √ 2.3 The major branches of Artificial Intelligence  Expert Systems – hardware and software that stores knowledge and makes inferences, allows similar to a human expert  Robotics – mechanical or computer devices that perform tasks requiring a high degree of precision or that are tedious or hazardous for humans  Vision systems – the hardware and software that permit computers to capture, store and manipulate visual images  Natural Language Processing and Voice Recognition – natural language processing is processing that allows the computer to understand and react to statements and commands made in a “natural” language, such as English.  Learning systems – a combination of software and hardware that allows the computer to change how it functions or reacts to situations based on feedback it receives  Neural Networks – a computer system that attempts to simulate the functioning of a human brain  Genetic Algorithm – an approach to solving large, complex problems in which a number of related operations or models change and evolve until the best one emerges  Intelligent agent – programs and a knowledge base used to perform a specific task for a person, a process or another program; also called robot or bot Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 3. Expert Systems An expert system outputs a recommendation based on answers given to it by users (who are not experts in the field). The intention of the system is to capture the expert’s knowledge and make it available to those who lack this knowledge. 3.1 When to use Expert Systems Develop an expert system if it can do any of the following:  Provide a high potential payoff or significantly reduce downside risk  Capture and preserve irreplaceable human expertise  Solve a problem that is not easily solved using traditional programming techniques  Develop a system which is more consistent than human experts  Provide expertise needed at a number of locations at the same time or in a hostile environment that is dangerous to human health  Provide expertise that is expensive or rare  Develop a solution faster than human experts can  Provide expertise needed for training and development to share the wisdom and experience of human experts with many people 3.2 Components of Expert Systems  Knowledge base – a component of an expert system that stores all relevant information, data, rules, cases, and relationships used by the expert system  Inference Engine – part of the expert system that seeks information and relationships from the knowledge base and provides answers, predictions, and suggestions the way a human expert would  Explanation Facility – component of an expert system that allows a user or decision maker to understand how the expert system arrived at certain conclusions or results  User Interface 4. Virtual Reality Virtual Reality is the simulation of a real or imagined environment that can be experienced visually in three dimensions. A virtual reality system enables one or more users to move and react in a computer simulated environment, they also require special interface devices that transmit the sights, sounds and sensations of the simulated world to the user. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CHAPTER 10 Pervasive Computing Introduction Information systems are no longer tied to a desk in an office. New devices are being developed that people are happy to carry with them – tiny devices such as the iPod or a smart-phone. Such devices do not have the functionality of a PC, but they are more convenient and can be taken anywhere. The other direction is that rather than a new device, computing power is being incorporated into existing devices and objects that are already well known to us, such as a jacket, a pair of glasses or a car. This move away from the desktop is known as pervasive computing, or ubiquitous computing: ubiquitous because computers are all around us, even if we don’t always realize it. Computer Supported Cooperative Work is a term that refers to technologies which allow groups to work together to achieve goals. 2. Wireless Internet Access Central to being able to access information “on the move” is wireless Internet access. A Wi-Fi hotspot is an area where wireless access is available. The business benefit of Wi-Fi are clear – mobile access to information; employees away on business can easily send and receive email, using any one of a number of devices. They can access information on company websites or read about local conditions on news services. They could also access sensitive information on company extranets. 3. Mobile Devices The list of devices that can make use of Wi-Fi hotspots is growing. It now includes desktop computers, laptops, tablet PCs, mobile phones, mobile game consoles such as Nintendo DS, and pocket PCs and VoIP phones. Some mobile devices are stand alone and do not require Internet access to make them useful.  Smartphones Smartphones and tablet computers are now a viable alternative to laptops. These tiny devices are cheaper and more robust than laptops and can be combined with a range of accessories to increase their functionality. The most useful accessory is a keyboard that can be attached to the smartphone so that the data can be entered into it, as it could into a laptop or PC. These keyboards can be attached by a cable or wirelessly using the Bluetooth protocol. Another useful accessory is a cable to enable the smartphone to be attached to a projector, to give presentations for example. One drawback to using a smartphone to give presentations is that it is difficult to create or edit PowerPoint slides on them. By connecting a global positioning system (GPS) receiver and installing map software such as TomTom, a smartphone can be used as a powerful navigational aid, either in a car or, if the receiver is wireless, on foot. A smartphone can also be used to play audio and video files.  Wearable Technology Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Miniaturizing smartphone technology further allows it to become part of the clothes we wear, such as a jacket or belt. Coupled with other things we are comfortably wearing, for instance glasses with which we receive visual information or earphones for audio information, computing power can become something we routinely take with us and use everywhere. Wearable computing refers to computers and computing technology that are worn on the body (If a smartphone is attached to a user’s belt, it is being “worn” by that user). Some other potential applications for wearable computing are recording what the wearer sees and hears and how they move, and transmitting personal information between people, rather like an electronic business card.  E-money E-money refers to the transfer of funds electronically rather than by handing over physical coins and notes. It can be implemented in a number of ways (e.g. paying for goods and services over the Internet). Another form of e-money is virtual currency such as bitcoin. E-money has two implications for business: o There is the convenience of employees using it themselves when on business trips o Customers may come to expect to be able to pay for goods and services using e-money in the future  Tangible Media A new and interesting way to present information stored on a computer is through the use of physical objects. Phicon stands for “physical icon” and is a physical representation of digital data, in the same way that an icon on a computer screen represents a file.  Personal Robotics A term which refers to robotic companions that people socialize with.  Virtual Pets A virtual pet is an artificial companion, it could be screen based, i.e. the pet is animated on a computer monitor, or a robot 4. Computer Supported Cooperative Work Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) refers to technologies that allow groups to work together to achieve goals. Individuals in the groups can be co-located or geographically separated. The work can happen at the same time or at different times. Different CSCW technologies exist to support these different modes of work. In global companies, CSCW technology is a powerful tool enabling a company to make the best of its human resources no matter where they are located. Below are some CSCW tools:  Videoconferencing A videoconference is a simultaneous communication between two or more parties where they both see and hear each other. A videoconference can be set up using instant messaging software. For businesses, videoconferences are useful to hold global meetings.  Messaging Messaging technology includes e-mail, instant messaging and web chat rooms. Email is useful for asynchronous text-based communication. Instant messaging is used for synchronous communication – two or more people communicating at the same time, usually typing short sentences to build up a conversation. Instant messaging is extremely useful and can be used by Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 employees to work on a problem together. One advantage messaging has is that the text can be easily saved and re-read at a later date.  Interactive Whiteboards Essentially, an interactive whiteboard is a combination of a whiteboard and a PC. It can be used in a number of ways. Users can write on the whiteboard and then save what has been written as an image on their computer. This negates the need to take notes about what has been written after a meeting has finished. What is saved on the PC needn’t be a static image – it could be an animation of everything that was written, including things that were rubbed out.  Wikis A wiki is a web page that can be edited by anyone with the proper authority. The most famous example is Wikipedia, which can be edited by any web user – very few restrictions are put in place. Wikis are clearly a good way of sharing knowledge and are being used by a large number of research groups and businesses to allow employees to share their thoughts and ideas, and post up good practice.  MMOGs MMOG stands for “Massively Multiplayer Online Game”. They exists as 3D virtual worlds – which are computer-based environments where users’ avatars can interact.  Blogs and Podcasts blog, short for weblog, is a website that people create and use to write about their observations, experiences and feelings on a wide range of topics. Technically, it is identical to any other web page, although the content of a blog is updated much more frequently, typically every day. A blog is like a diary. When people post information to a blog, it is placed at the top of the blog. Blogs can contain links to other material, and people can usually comment on posts. Blogs are easy to post to, but they can cause problems when people tell or share too much. podcast is an audio broadcast over the Internet. A podcast is essentially an audio blog, like a personal radio station on the internet, and extends blogging by adding audio messages. 5. More Applications of Electronic and Mobile Commerce  Retail and Wholesale E-commerce is being used extensively in retailing and wholesaling. Electronic retailing, sometimes called e-tailing, is the direct sale of products or services by businesses to customers through electronic shops, which are typically designed around the familiar electronic catalogue and shopping cart model. A cybermall is a single website that offers many products and services at one internet location. An internet cybermall pulls multiple buyers and sellers into one virtual place, easily reachable through a web browser. A key sector of wholesale e-commerce is spending on manufacturing, repair and operations of goods and services – from simple office supplies to mission-critical equipment, such as the motors, pumps, compressors and instruments that keep manufacturing facilities running smoothly.  Manufacturing One approach taken by many manufactures to raise profitability and improve customer service is to move their supply chain operations onto the internet. Here they can form an electronic exchange to join with competitors and suppliers’ alike, using computers and websites to buy and sell goods, trade market information and run back-office operations, such as inventory control.  Marketing The nature of the web allows firms to gather much more information about customer behaviour and preferences than they could using other marketing approaches. Marketing organisations can measure many online activities as customers and potential customers gather information and make Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 their purchase decisions. Analysis of this data is complicated because of the web’s interactivity and because each visitor voluntarily provides or refuses to provide personal data such as name, address, telephone number and demographic data.  Investment and Finance  Auctions  Anywhere, Anytime Applications of Mobile Commerce Because m-commerce devices usually have a single user, they are ideal for accessing personal information and receiving targeted messages for a particular consumer. Through m-commerce, companies can reach individual consumers to establish one-to-one marketing relationships and communicate whenever it is convenient – in short, anytime anywhere. The following are just a few examples of potential m-commerce applications: o Banking customers can use their wireless handheld devices to access their accounts and pay their bills o Clients of brokerage firms can view stock prizes and company research as well as conduct trades to fit their schedules o Information services such as financial news, sports information and traffic updates can be delivered to people whenever they want o On-the-move retail consumers can place and pay for orders instantaneously o Telecommunications service users can view service changes, pay bills and customize their services o Retailers and service providers can send potential customers advertising, promotions or coupons to entice them to try their services as they move past their place of business  Advantages of Electronic and Mobile Commerce o Global reach o Reduced costs o Speed the flow of goods and information o Increased accuracy o Improved customer service Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CHAPTER 11 System Analysis An Overview of Systems development In today’s businesses, managers and employees in all functional areas work together and use business information systems. Because they are central to project success, users are helping with development and, in many cases, leading the way. Users might request that a system development team determine whether they should purchase a few PCs, update an existing order processing system, develop a new medical diagnostic or design and implement a new website. In other cases, systems development might involve purchasing or leasing a system such as an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) package. 1 Participants in Systems Development Effective systems development requires a team effort. The team usually consists of users, managers, Systems development specialists, various support personnel and other stakeholders. This team, called the development team, is responsible for determining the objectives of the new information system and delivering a system that meets these objectives. Many development teams use a project manager to head the systems development effort and to help coordinate the systems development process. project is a planned collection of activities that achieves a goal, such as constructing a new manufacturing plant or developing a new decision support system. All projects have a defined starting point and ending point, normally given as a specific date – most also have a budget. The project manager is responsible for coordinating all people and resources needed to complete the project on time. Project managers need technical, business and people skills. In addition to completing the project on time and within the specified budget, the project manager is usually responsible for controlling project quality, training personnel, facilitating communication, managing risks and acquiring any necessary equipment, including office supplies and sophisticated computer systems. In the context of systems development, stakeholders are people who, either themselves or through the area of the organisation they represent, ultimately benefit from the systems development project. Users are people who will interact with the system regularly. They can be employees, managers, or suppliers. A system analyst is a professional who specialised in analysing and designing business systems. Systems analysts play various roles while interacting with the users, management, vendors and supplier, external companies, programmers, and other IS support personnel. programmer is responsible for modifying or developing programs to satisfy user requirements. The other support personnel on the development team are mostly technical specialists, including database and telecommunications experts, hardware engineers and supplier representatives. Typical reasons to initiate a Systems Development Project: Reason Example Problems with existing system Not processing orders fast enough Desire to exploit new opportunities M-commerce Increasing competition New competitor enters industry Desire to make more effective use of information Wanting to set up a customer relationship management system to expand and exploit information stored on customers Organisational growth Expanding customer base Merger or acquisition Buying out a competitor Change in the environment New regulations imposed by government Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 1.2 Information Systems Planning and Aligning Organisation and IS Goals The term information systems planning refers to translating strategic and organisational goals into systems development initiatives. Proper IS planning ensures that specific systems development objectives support organisational goals. Aligning organisational goals and IS goals is critical for any successful systems development effort. Because information systems support other business activities, IS staff and people in other departments need to understand each other’s responsibilities and tasks. One of the primary benefits of IS planning and alignment of business goals is a long-range view of information systems use in the organisation. The steps of IS planning:  Strategic plan  Develop overall objectives  Identify IS projects – previously unplanned systems projects  Set priorities and select projects  Analyse resource requirements  Set schedules and deadlines  Develop IS planning document Creative analysis involves investigating new approaches to existing problems. Typically, new solutions are inspired by people and events not directly related to the problem. Critical analysis requires unbiased and careful questioning of whether system elements are related in the most effective ways. It involves considering the establishment of new or different relationships between systems elements and perhaps introducing new elements into the system. Critical analysis in systems development involves the following actions:  Questioning statements and assumptions  Identifying and resolving objectives and orientations that conflict 1.3 Establishing Objectives for Systems Development The overall objective of systems development is to achieve business goals, not technical goals, by delivering the right information to the right person at the right time. The impact a particular system has on an organisation’s ability to meet its goals determines the true value of that system to the organisation. Although all systems should support business goals, some systems are more pivotal in continued operations and goal attainment than others. These systems are called “key operational’. The goals defined for an organisation also define the objectives that are set for a system. Critical Success Factors (CSF) are factors that are essential to the success of certain functional areas of an organisation. Regardless of the particular systems development effort, the development process should define a system with specific performance and cost objectives. The success or failure of the systems development effort will be measured against these objectives.  Performance Objectives The extent to which a system performs as desired can be measured through its performance objectives. Systems performance is usually determined by factors such as the following: o The quality or usefulness of the output o The accuracy of the output o The quality or usefulness of the format of the output o The speed at which output is generated Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 o The scalability of the resulting system o The degree to which business risk is reduced  Cost Objectives Organisations can spend more than is necessary during a systems development project. The benefits of achieving performance goals should be balanced with all costs associated with the system, including the following: o Development costs o Costs related to the uniqueness of the system application o Fixed investments in hardware and related equipment o Ongoing operating costs of the system 2. Systems Development Lifecycles The systems development process is also called the “systems development lifecycle” (SDLC) because the activities associated with it are ongoing. As each system is built, the project has timelines and deadlines, until the system is installed and accepted. The life of the system then continues as it is maintained and reviewed. If the system needs significant improvement beyond the scope of maintenance, if it needs to be replaced because of a new generation of technology, or if the IS needs of the organisation change significantly, a new project will be initiated and the cycle will start over. A key fact of systems development is that the later in the SDLC an error is detected, the more expensive it is to correct. Several common system development lifecycles exists: the traditional or waterfall approach, prototyping, rapid application development (RAD) and end-user development. 2.1 The Traditional Systems Development Lifecycle Traditional systems development efforts can range from a small project, such as purchasing an inexpensive computer program, to a major undertaking. The steps of traditional systems development might vary from the one company to the next, but most approaches have five common phases:  Investigation – understand the problem (the primary result of this phase is a defined development project for which business problems or opportunity statements have been created, to which organisational resources have been committed, and for which systems analysis is recommended)  Analysis – determine what must be done to solve the problem (this phase involves studying existing systems and work processes to identify strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for improvement. The major outcome of this phase is a list of requirements and priorities)  Design – the solution is planned out (the primary result of this phase is a technical design that either describes the new system or describes how existing systems will be modified. The system design details system outputs, inputs and user interfaces; specifies hardware, software, database, telecommunications, personnel and procedure components; and shows how these components are related)  Implementation – the solution is built or bought and replaces the old system (it involves creating or buying the various system components detailed in the design, assembling them and placing the new or modified system into operation. An important task during this phase is to train the users. System implementation results in an installed, operational information system that meets the business needs for which it was developed)  Maintenance and Review – the new system is evaluated (the purpose of systems maintenance and review is to ensure that the system operates as intended and to modify the system so that it continues to meet changing business needs. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Advantages and Disadvantages of Traditional SDLC: Advantages Disadvantages Formal review at the end of each phase allows maximum management control Users get a system that meets the needs as understood by the developer, this might not be what is really needed This approach creates considerable system documentation Documentation is expensive and time consuming to create. It is also difficult to keep current Formal documentation ensures that system requirements can be traced back to stated business needs Often, user needs go unstated or are misunderstood It produces many intermediate products that can be reviewed to see whether they meet the users’ needs and conform to standards Users cannot easily review intermediate products and evaluate whether a particular product meets their business requirements 2.2 Prototyping Prototyping, also known as the evolutionary lifecycle, takes an iterative approach to the system development process. During each iteration, requirements and alternative solutions to the problem are identified and analysed, new solutions are designed and a portion of the system is implemented. Users are then encouraged to try the prototype and provide feedback. Prototyping begins with creating a preliminary model of a major subsystem or a scale-down version of the entire system. After they are developed and refined, the prototypical reports and input screens are used as models for the actual system, which can be developed using an end-user programming language such as Visual Basic. Prototypes can be classified as operational or non-operational. An operational prototype is a prototype that has functionality – it does something towards solving the problem. It may accept input, partially process it and output the results. A non-operational prototype is a mock-up or model. It typically includes output and input specifications and formats. Advantages and Disadvantages of Prototyping: Advantages Disadvantages Users can try the system and provide constructive feedback during development Each iteration builds on the previous one. The final solution might be only incrementally better than the initial solution An operational prototype can be produced in weeks Formal end-of-phase reviews might not occur. Thus, it is very difficult to contain the scope of the prototype, and the project never seems to end As solutions emerge, users become more positive about the process and the results System documentation is often absent or incomplete because the primary focus is on development of the prototype Prototyping enables early detection of errors and omissions System backup and recovery, performance and security issues can be overlooked in the haste to develop a prototype 2.3 Rapid Application Development, Agile Development, Joint Application Development, and Other Systems Development Approaches Rapid Application Development (RAD) employs tools, techniques and methodologies designed to speed up application development. RAD reduces paper-based documentation, automatically generates program source code and facilitates user participation in design and development activities. It makes adapting to changing system requirements easier. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Other approaches to rapid development, such as agile development, allows the system to change as they are being developed. Agile development requires frequent face-to-face meetings with the systems developers and users as they modify, refine and test how the system meets users’ needs and what its capabilities are. Extreme Programming (XP), a form of agile development, uses pairs of programmers who work together to design, test and code parts of the system as they develop. The iterative nature of XP helps companies develop robust systems, with fewer errors. RAD makes extensive use of the joint application development (JAD) process for data collection and requirements analysis. JAD involves group meetings in which users, stakeholders and IS professionals work together to analyse existing systems, propose possible solutions and define the requirements of a new or modified system. JAD groups consist of both problem holders and solution providers. A group normally requires one or more top-level executives who initiate the JAD process, a group leader for the meetings, potential users and one or more individuals who act as secretaries and clerks to record what is accomplished and to provide general support for the sessions. RAD should not be used on every software development project. It is best suited for DSSs and MISs and less well suited for TPS. During a RAD project, the level of participation of stakeholders and users is much higher than in other approaches. Advantages and Disadvantages of RAD: Advantages Disadvantages For appropriate projects, this approach puts an application into production sooner than any other approach This intense SDLC can burn out systems developers and other project participants Documentation is produced as a by-product of completing project tasks This approach requires systems analysts and users to be skilled in RAD systems development tools and RAD techniques RAD forces teamwork and lots of iteration between users and stakeholders RAD requires a larger percentage of stakeholders and users’ time than other approaches 2.4 The End-User Systems Development Lifecycle The term end-user systems development describes any systems development project in which business managers and users assume the primary effort. Rather than ignoring these initiatives, astute IS professionals encourage them by offering guidance and support. Providing technical assistance, communicating standards and sharing “best practices” throughout the organisation are some ways IS professionals work with motivated managers and employees undertaking their own systems development. In this way, end-user-developed systems can be structured as complementary to, rather than in conflict with, existing and emerging information systems. End-user systems development does have some disadvantages. Some end users don’t have the training to effectively develop and test a system. Expensive mistakes can be made using faulty spreadsheets. Most end-user systems are also poorly documented and therefore difficult to maintain. When these systems are updated, problems can be introduced that make the system error-prone. In addition, some end users spend time and corporate resources developing systems that are already available. 2.5 Outsourcing and On-Demand Computing Many companies hire an outside consulting firm or computer company that specialises in systems development to take over some or all of its development and operations activities. Outsourcing can be a good idea under the following circumstances:  When a company believes it can cut costs  When a firm has limited opportunity to distinguish itself competitively through a particular IS operation or application Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  When uninterrupted IS service is not crucial  When outsourcing does not strip the company of technical know-how required for future IS innovation  When the firm’s existing IS capabilities are limited, ineffective or technically inferior  When a firm is downsizing The decision to outsource systems development is often a response to downsizing, which reduces the number of employees or managers, equipment and systems, and even functions and departments. Outsourcing allows companies to downsize there is departments and alleviate difficult financial situations by reducing payroll and other expenses. Reducing costs, obtaining state-of-the-art technology, eliminating staffing and personnel problems, and increasing technological flexibility are reasons that companies have used in the outsourcing and on-demand computing approaches. Organisations can use a number of guidelines to make outsourcing a success, including the following:  Keep tight controls on the outsourcing project  Treat outsourcing companies as partners  Start with smaller outsourcing jobs  Create effective communications channels between the organisation and the outsourcing company  Carefully review legal outsourcing contracts, including rights and remedies clauses Outsourcing has some disadvantages, however. Internal expertise can be lost and loyalty can suffer under an outsourcing arrangement. When a company outsources, key IS personnel with expertise in technical and business functions are no longer needed. When these IS employees leave, their experience with the organisation and expertise in information systems are lost. . Factors Affecting System Development Success Successful systems development means delivering a system that meets user and organisational needs – on time and within budget. There is no formula for achieving this, but the following factors are known to have impact on success:  Involvement – getting users and other stakeholders involved in systems development is critical for most systems development projects. Having the support of top-level managers is also important. The involvement of users throughout the development will mean they are less likely to resist the software when it is delivered.  Degree of Change – a major factor that affects the quality of systems development is the degree of change associated with the project. The scope can vary from implementing minor enhancements to an existing system, up to major reengineering. The project team needs to recognise where they are on this spectrum of change  Managing Change – the ability to manage change is critical to the success of systems development. New systems inevitably cause change. Unfortunately, not everyone adopts easily, and the increasing complexity of systems can multiply the problems. Managing change requires the ability to recognise existing or potential problems and deal with them before they become a serious threat to the success of the new or modified system. Here are some of the most common problems: o Fear that the employee will lose his or her job, power or influence within the organisation o Belief that the proposed system will create more work than it eliminates o Reluctance to work with “computer people” o Anxiety that the proposed system will negatively alter the structure of the organisation o Belief that other problems are more pressing than those solved by the proposed system or that the system is being developed by people unfamiliar with “the way things need to get done” o Unwillingness to learn new procedures or approaches Preventing or dealing with these types of problems requires a coordinated effort from stakeholders and users, managers and IS personnel.

The bigger the project, the more likely that poor planning will lead to significant problems. Many companies find that large systems projects fall behind schedule, go over budget and do not meet expectations. Certain factors contribute to the failure of systems development projects. These factors and countermeasures to eliminate or alleviate the problem are summarised below: Factor Countermeasure Solving the wrong problem Establish a clear connection between the project and organisational goals Poor problem definition and analysis Follow a standard systems development approach Poor communication There is no easy answer to this common problem Project is too ambitious Narrow the project focus to address only the most important business opportunities Lack of top management support Identify the senior manager who has the most to gain from the success of the project and recruit this person to champion the project Lack of management and user involvement Identify and recruit key stakeholders to be active participants in the project Inadequate or improper system design Follow a standard systems development approach Lack of standards Implement a standards system, such as ISO 9001 Poor testing and implementation Plan sufficient time for this activity Users cannot use the system effectively Develop a rigorous user-training programme and budget sufficient time in the schedule to execute it Lack of concern for maintenance Include an estimate of employee effort and costs for maintenance in the original project justification The development of information systems requires a constant trade-off of schedule and cost versus quality. Historically, the development of application software has overemphasized schedule and cost to the detriment of quality. Organisational experience with the systems development process is also a key factor in systems development success. The capability maturity model (CMM) is one way to measure this experience.  Use of Project Management Tools Project management involves planning, scheduling, directing and controlling human, financial and technological resources for a defined task whose result is achievement of specific goals and objectives. A project schedule is a detailed description of what is to be done. Each project activity, the use of personnel and other resources, and expected completion dates are described. A project milestone is a critical date for the completion of a major part of the project. The completion of program design, coding, testing and release are examples of milestones for a programming project. The deadline is the date the entire project is to be completed and operational – when the organisation can expect to begin to reap the benefits of the project. In systems development, each activity has an earliest start date, earliest finish time and slack time, which is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the entire project. The critical path consists of all activities that if delayed, would delay the entire project. Any problems with critical-path activities will cause problems for the entire project. A formalised approach called the program evaluation and review technique (PERT) creates three time estimates for an activity: shortest possible time, most likely time and longest possible time. A formula is then applied to determine a single PERT time estimate. Gantt chart is a graphical tool used for planning, monitoring and coordinating projects; it is essentially a grid that lists activities and deadlines.  Use of Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) Tools Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CASE tools automate many of the tasks required in a systems development effort and encourage adherence to the SDLC, thus instilling a high degree of rigour standardisation to the entire systems development process. The CASE tool searches for all possible design scenarios to make sure that the program is error free. Advantages and Disadvantages of CASE tools: Advantages Disadvantages Produce systems with a longer effective operational life Increase the initial costs of building and maintaining systems Produce systems that more closely meet user needs and requirements Require more extensive and accurate definition of user needs and requirements Produce systems with excellent documentation Can be difficult to customise Produce systems that need less systems support Require more training of maintenance staff Produce more flexible systems Can be difficult to use with existing systems 4. System Investigation Systems investigation is the first phase in the traditional SDLC of a new or modified business information system. The purpose is to identify potential problems and opportunities and consider them in light of the goals of the company. Systems investigation attempts to uncover answers to the following questions:  What primary problems is the new system to solve?  What opportunities might a new or enhanced system provide?  What new hardware, software, databases, telecommunications, personnel, or procedures will improve an existing system or are required in a new system?  What are the potential costs?  What are the associated risks? 4.1 Initiating Systems Investigation Because systems development requests can require considerable time and effort to implement, many organisations have adopted a formal procedure for initiating systems development, beginning with systems investigation. The systems request form is a document that is filled out by someone who wants the IS department to initiate systems investigation. This form typically includes the following information:  Problems with or opportunities for the system  Objectives of systems investigation  Overview of the proposed system  Expected costs and benefits of the proposed system 4.2 Participants in Systems Investigation Ideally, functional managers are heavily involved during the investigation phase. Other members could include users or stakeholders outside management, such as an employee who helps initiate systems development. The technical and financial expertise of others participating in investigation help the team to determine whether the problem is worth solving. The members of the development team who participate in investigation are then responsible for gathering and analysing data, preparing a report justifying systems development and presenting the results to top- level managers. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 4.3 Feasibility Analysis A key step of the systems investigation phase is feasibility analysis, which assesses technical, legal, operational, and schedule feasibility. Technical feasibility is concerned with whether the hardware, software and other system components can be acquired or developed to solve the problem. Economic feasibility determines whether the project makes financial sense and whether predicted benefits offsets the cost and time needed to obtain them. Legal feasibility determines whether laws or regulations can prevent or limit a systems development project. Operational feasibility is a measure of whether the project can be put into action or operation. Schedule feasibility determines whether the project can be completed in a reasonable amount of time – a process that involves balancing the time and resource requirements of the project with other projects. 4.4 The Systems Investigation Report The primary outcome of systems investigation is a systems investigation report, also called a feasibility study. This report summarises the results of systems investigation and the process of feasibility analysis and recommends a course of action; continue on into systems analysis, modify the project in some manner or drop it. The systems investigation report is reviewed by senior management, often organised as an advisory committee, or steering committee, consisting of senior management and users from the IS department and other functional areas. These people help IS personnel with their decisions about the use of information systems in the business and give authorisation to pursue further systems development activities. 5. System Analysis After a project has been approved for further study, the next step is to answer the question: “what must the information system do to solve the problem?” 5.1 General Considerations System analysis starts by clarifying the overall goals of the organisation and determining how the existing or proposed information system helps meet them. 5.2 Participants in Systems Analysis The first step in formal analysis is to assemble a team to study the existing system. This group includes members of the original investigation team – from users and stakeholders to IS personnel and management. Most organisations usually allow key members of the development team not only to analyse the condition of the existing system but also to perform other aspects of systems development, such as design and implementation. 5.3 Data Collection and Analysis The purpose of data collection is to seek additional information about the problems or needs identified in the systems investigation report. During this process, the strengths and weaknesses of the existing system are emphasized. Data collection might require a number of tools and techniques, such as interviews, direct observation and questionnaires. Direct observation is the process of watching the existing system in action by one or more members of the analysis team. While questionnaires are a method of gathering data when the data sources are spread over a wide geographic area. Interviews can either be structured or unstructured. In a structured interview, the questions are written in advance. In an unstructured interview, the interviewer relies on experience in asking the best questions to uncover the inherent problems to the existing system. An advantage of the unstructured interview is that it allows the interviewer to ask follow-up or clarifying questions immediately. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 5.4 Requirements Analysis The overall purpose of requirements analysis is to determine user, stakeholder, and organisational needs. Questions that should be asked during requirements analysis include the following:  Are these stakeholders satisfied with the current system?  What improvement should be made? One of the most difficult procedures in systems analysis is confirming user or system requirements. In some cases, communications problems can interfere with determining these requirements. 5.5 Critical Success Factors Managers and decision makers are asked to list only the factors that are critical to the success of their area of the organisation. A critical success factor (CSF) for a production manager might be adequate raw materials from suppliers, and may be different for a manager from another division. 5.6 The IS Plan The IS plan translates strategic and organisational goals into systems development initiatives. The IS planning process often generates strategic planning documents that can be used to define system requirements. 5.7 Screen and Report Layout Developing formats for printed reports and screens to capture data and display information are some of the common tasks associated with developing systems. Screens and reports relating to systems output are specified first to verify that the desired solution is being delivered. Manual or computerised screen and report layout facilities are used to capture both input and output requirements. 5.8 Requirements Analysis Tools A number of tools can be used to document requirements analysis, including CASE tools. As requirements are developed and agreed on, entity-relationship diagrams, data-flow diagrams, screen and report layout forms, and other types of documentation are stored in the CASE repository. These requirements might also be used later as a reference during the rest of systems development or for a different systems development project. 5.9 Object-Oriented Systems Analysis Another alternative to analysing the existing system using data-flow diagrams and flowcharts is the object- oriented approach to systems analysis. With this approach, system analysts are looking for classes – things within the system that have data and action – rather than entities. 5.10 The System Analysis Report Systems analysis concludes with a formal systems analysis report. It should cover the following elements:  The strengths and weaknesses of the existing system from a stakeholders perspective  The user/stakeholder requirements for the new system  The organisational requirements for the new system  A description of what the new information system should do to solve the problem Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 CHAPTER 12 System Design and Implementation Systems Design Systems design is a stage of systems development where a solution to the problem is planned out and documented. The purpose of system design is to answer the question “how will the information system solve the problem?” The primary result of the systems design phase is a technical design that details system inputs and the processing required to produce outputs, user interfaces, hardware, software, databases, telecommunications, personnel and procedures, and shows how these components are related. The system that is designed should meet all the requirements specified during the analysis phase, overcome the shortcomings of the existing system and help the organisation achieve its goals. Two key aspects of systems design are:  Logical design – a description of the functional requirements of a system  Physical design – the specification of the characteristics of the system components necessary to put the logical design into action 1.1 Interface Design and Controls Some special system characteristics should be considered during both logical and physical design. These characteristics relate to how users access and interact with the system. Examples below:  Menu-driven system – a system in which users simply pick what they want to do from a list of alternatives  Command line interface – an interface where the user types text commands to the computer Some other interface considerations are whether or not to include interactive help, whether the interface should be 2D or 3D, whether or not to use virtual reality, a touch screen or a keyboard, and whether to include procedures to help with data entry. Such procedures include spell checking and lookup tables. The Elements of Good Interactive Dialogue: Element Description Clarity The computer system should ask for information using easily understood language. Whenever possible, the users themselves should help select the words and phrases used for dialogue with the computer system. Response time Ideally, responses from the computer system should approximate a normal response time from a human being carrying on the same sort of dialogue. Consistency The system should use the same commands, phrases, words and function keys for all applications. After a user learns one application, all others will then be easier to use. Format The system should use an attractive format and layout for all screens. The use of colour, highlighting and the position of information on the screen should be considered carefully and applied consistently. Jargon All dialogue should be written in easy-to-understand terms. Avoid jargon known only to IS specialists. Respect All dialogue should be developed professionally and with respect. Dialogue should not talk down to or insult the user. Avoid statements such as “You have made a fatal error”. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 1.2 Design of System Security and Controls In addition to considering the system’s interface and user interactions, designers must also develop system security and controls for all aspects of the system, including hardware, software, database systems, and telecommunications and Internet operations. These key considerations involve the following:  Error prevention, Detection and Correction; A new information system can be designed to check for certain errors itself. When users input values, the system can check that the values entered make sense and if not the user is alerted. An alternative is to avoid the user entering data themselves (e.g. Make use of a drop-down list).  System controls; Security lapses, fraud and the invasion of privacy can present disastrous problems. For example, because of an inadequate security and control system, a futures and options trader for a Bank lost almost $1 billion. A simple systems control might have prevented a problem that caused the 200-year-old bank to collapse. Preventing and detecting these problems is an important part of systems design. Prevention includes the following: o Determining potential problems o Ranking the importance of these problems o Planning the best place and approach to prevent problems o Deciding the best way to handle problems if they occur Most IS departments have a set of general operating rules that help protect the system. Some of them are as follows: o Input controls: maintain input integrity and security o Processing controls: deal with all aspects of processing and storage o Output controls: ensure that output is handled correctly o Database controls: deal with ensuring an efficient and effective database system o Telecommunications controls: provide accurate and reliable data and information transfer among systems o Personnel controls: make sure that only authorised personnel have access to certain systems to help prevent computer-related mistakes and crime  Disaster planning and recovery; Disaster planning is the process of anticipating and providing for disasters. Disaster Recovery is the implementation of the disaster plan. 1.3 Generating Systems Design Alternatives The development team will want to generate different designs. One approach is to come up with a basic, cheaper solution; or a top-of-the-range solution at the edge of what can be afforded; or a mix solution sitting somewhere between the two. If the new system is complex, it might want to involve personnel from inside and outside the firm in generating alternative designs. If new hardware and software are to be acquired from an outside vendor, a formal request for proposal (RFP) can be made (which is a document that specifies in detail required resources such as hardware and software).  Request for Proposals The RFP is an important document for many organisations involved with large, complex systems development efforts. Smaller, less complex systems often do not require an RFP. When a RFP is used, it often results in a formal bid that is used to determine who gets a contract for new or modified systems.  Financial Options When acquiring computer systems, several choices are available, including purchase, lease or rent. Cost objectives and constraints set for the system play a significant role in the choice, as do the advantages and disadvantages of each. The table below summarises the advantages and disadvantages of these financial options: Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 Renting (Short-term Option) Advantages Disadvantages No risk of obsolescence No ownership of equipment No long-term financial investment High monthly costs No initial investment of funds Restrictive rental agreements Maintenance usually included Leasing (Longer-term Option) Advantages Disadvantages No risk of obsolescence High costs of cancelling lease No long-term financial investment Longer time commitment than renting No initial investment of funds No ownership of equipment Less expensive than renting Purchasing Advantages Disadvantages Total control over equipment High initial investment Can sell equipment at any time Additional cost of maintenance Can depreciate equipment Possibility of obsolescence Low cost if owned for a number of years Other expenses, included taxes and insurance  Evaluating and Selecting a Systems Design The final step in systems design is to evaluate the various alternatives and select the one that will offer the best solution for organisational goals. Depending on their weight, any one of these objectives might result in the selection of one design over another. Normally, evaluation and selection involves both a preliminary and a final evaluation before a design is selected.  The Preliminary Evaluation An initial assessment whose purpose is to dismiss the unwanted proposals; begins after all proposals have been submitted  The Final Evaluation A detailed investigation of the proposals offered by the vendors remaining after the preliminary evaluation  Group Consensus Evaluation Decision making by a group that is appointed and given the responsibility of making the final evaluation and selection  Cost-benefit Analysis An approach that lists the costs and benefits of each proposed system. After they are expressed in monetary terms, all the costs are compared with all the benefits  Benchmark Test An examination that compares computer systems operating under the same conditions  Point Evaluation An evaluation process in which each evaluation factor is assigned a weight, in percentage points, based on importance. Then each proposed system is evaluated in terms of this factor and given a score ranging from 0 to 100. The scores are totalled and the system with the greatest total score is selected. 1.4 Freezing Design Specifications Near the end of the design stage, some organisations prohibit further changes in the design of the system. Freezing systems design specifications means that the user agrees in writing that the design is acceptable. Other organisations, however, allow or even encourage design changes. 1.5 The Contract Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 One of the most important steps in systems design, if new computer facilities are being acquired, is to develop a good contract. Finding the best terms where everyone makes a profit can be difficult. Most computer vendors provide standard contracts; however, such contracts are designed to protect the vendor, not necessarily the organisation buying the computer equipment. 1.6 The Design Report Systems specifications are the final results of systems design. They include a technical description that details system outputs, inputs and user interfaces, as well as all hardware, software, databases, telecommunications, personnel and procedure components, and the way these components are related. The specifications are contained in a design report, which is the primary result of system design. . Systems Implementation Systems implementation is a stage of systems development that includes the following: 2.1 Acquiring Hardware from an IS Vendor To obtain the components for an information system, organisations can purchase, lease or rent computer hardware and other resources from an IS vendor. An IS vendor is a company that offers hardware, software, telecommunications systems, databases, IS personnel or other computer-related resources. Types of IS vendors include general computer manufacturers (such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard), small computer manufacturers (such as Dell and Gateway), peripheral equipment manufacturers (such as Epson and Cannon), computer dealers and distributors (such as PC World) and leasing companies (such as Hamilton Rentals and Hire Intelligence). Companies can also purchase used computer equipment. This option is especially attractive to firms that are experiencing an economic slowdown. 2.2 Acquiring Software: Make or Buy As with hardware, application software can be acquired in several ways. It can be purchased from external developers or developed in house. This decision is often called the make-or-buy decision. A comparison of the two approaches is shown below: Factor Off the Shelf (Buy) Bespoke (Make) Cost Lower cost Higher cost Needs Might not exactly match needs Software should exactly match needs Quality Usually high quality Quality can vary depending on the programming team Speed Can acquire it now Can take years to develop Competitive Advantage Other organisations can have the same software and same advantage Can develop a competitive advantage with good software 2.3 Acquiring Database and Telecommunications Systems Because databases are a blend of hardware and software, many of the approaches discussed earlier for acquiring hardware and software also apply to database systems. New or upgraded software might also be purchased or developed in-house. With the increased use of e-commerce, the Internet, intranets and extranets, telecommunications is one of the fastest-growing applications for today’s businesses and people. Like database systems, telecommunications systems require a blend of hardware and software. 2.4 User Preparation User preparation is the process of readying managers, decision makers, employees, other users and stakeholders for the new systems. This activity is an important but often ignored area of systems implementation. Without question, Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 training users in an essential part of user preparation, whether they are trained by internal personnel or by external training firms. 2.5 IS Personnel: Hiring and Training Depending on the size of the new system, an organisation might have to hire and, in some cases, train new IS personnel. An IS manager, systems analysts, computer programmers, data-entry operators and similar personnel might be needed for the new system. 2.6 Site Preparation The location of the new system needs to be prepared, a process called site preparation. For a small system, site preparation can be as simple as rearranging the furniture in an office to make room for a computer. With a larger system, this process is not so easy because it can require special wiring and air conditioning. 2.7 Data Preparation Data preparation, or data conversion, involves making sure that all files and databases are ready to be used with the new computer software and systems. 2.8 Installation Installation is the process of physically placing the computer equipment on the site and making it operational. Although normally the hardware manufacturer is responsible for installing computer equipment, someone from the organisation should oversee the process, making sure that all equipment specified in the contract is installed at the proper location. 2.9 Testing Good testing procedures are essential to make sure that the new or modified information system operates as intended. Inadequate testing can result in mistakes and problems. Better testing can prevent these problems. Several forms of testing should be used, including the following:  Unit testing – testing of individual programs  System testing – testing the entire system of programs  Volume testing – testing the application with a large amount of data  Integration testing – testing all related systems together  Acceptance testing – conducting any tests required by the user  Alpha testing – testing an incomplete or early version of the system  Beta testing – testing a complete and stable system by end-users 2.10 Start-Up Start-up is the process of making the final tested information system fully operational. Various start-up approaches are available:  Direct conversion – stopping the old system and starting the new system on a given date  Phase-in approach – slowly replacing components of the old system with those of the new one. This process is repeated for each application until the new system is running every application and performing as expected; also called a piecemeal approach  Pilot running – introducing the new system by direct conversation for one group of users rather than all users  Parallel running – running both the old and the new systems for a period of time 2.11 User Acceptance Most mainframe computer manufacturers use a formal user acceptance document – a formal agreement signed by the user that states that a phase of the installation or the complete system is approved.

Systems Operation and Maintenance Systems operation involves all aspects of using the new or modified system in all kinds of operating conditions. Getting the most out of a new or modified system during its operation is the most important aspect of systems operations for many organisations. The operation of any information system, however, does require adequate training and support before the system is used and continual support while the system is being used. This training and support is required for all stakeholders, including employees, customers and others. System maintenance involves checking, changing and enhancing the system to make it more useful in achieving user and organisational goals. Maintenance is important for individuals, groups and organisations. Organisations often have personnel dedicated to maintenance. Systems maintenance and review is the systems development phase that ensures the system operates as intended and modifies the system so that it continues to meet changing business needs. 3.1 Reasons for Maintenance  Changes in business processes  New request from stakeholders, users, and managers  Bugs or errors in the program  Technical and hardware problems  Corporate mergers and acquisitions  Government regulations  Change in the operating system or hardware on which the application runs  Unexpected events, such as severe weather or terrorist attacks 3.2 Types of Maintenance  Slipstream upgrade – a minor upgrade, typically a code adjustment or minor bug fix, not worth announcing. It usually requires recompiling all the code and, in so doing, it can create entirely new bugs.  Patch – a minor change to correct a problem or make a small enhancement. It is usually an addition to an existing program.  Release – a significant program change that often requires changes in the documentation of the software  Version – a major program change, typically encompassing many new features. 3.3 The Request for Maintenance Form A form authorizing modification of programs. 3.4 Performing Maintenance Depending on organisational policies, the people who perform systems maintenance vary. In some cases, the team who designs and builds the system also performs maintenance. This ongoing responsibility gives the designers and programmers an incentive to build systems well from the outset; if there are problems, they will have to fix them. In other cases, organisations have a separate maintenance team. This team is responsible for modifying, fixing and updating existing software. 3.5 The Financial Implications of Maintenance The cost of maintenance is staggering. For older programs, the total cost of maintenance can be up to five times greater than the total cost of development. The average programmers can spend more than half their time on Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 maintaining existing programs instead of developing new ones. In addition, as programs get older, total maintenance expenditures in time and money increase. With the use of newer programming languages and approaches, including object-oriented programming, maintenance costs are expected to decline. 3.6 The Relationship between Maintenance and Design Programs are expensive to develop, but they are even more expensive to maintain. Programs that are well designed and documented to be efficient, structured and flexible are less expensive to maintain in later years. Thus, there is a direct relationship between design and maintenance. 4. Systems Review Systems review, the final step of systems development, is the process of analysing systems to make sure that they are operating as intended. This process often compares the performance and benefits of the system as it was designed with the actual performance and benefits of the system in operation. Problems and opportunities uncovered during system reviews trigger systems development and begin the process anew. 4.1 Types of Review Procedures There are two types of review procedures:  Event-driven review – a review triggered by a problem or opportunity such as an error, a corporate merger or a new market for products.  Time-driven review – is performed after a specified amount of time. Many application programs are reviewed every six months to one year. With this approach, an existing system is monitored on a schedule. If problems or opportunities are uncovered, a new systems development cycle can be initiated. Examples of Review Types: Event-Driven Time-Driven Problem with an existing system Monthly review Merger Yearly review New account system Review every five years Executive decision that an upgraded Internet site is needed to stay competitive Five-year review 4.2 Factors to Consider During Systems Review Systems review should investigate a number of important factors, such as the following:  Mission – is the computer system helping the organisation achieve its overall mission?  Organisational goals – does the computer system support the specific goals of the various areas and departments of the organisation?  Hardware and software – are hardware and software up to date and adequate to handle current and future processing needs?  Database – is the current database up to date and accurate?  Telecommunications – is the current telecommunications system fast enough, and does it allow managers and workers to send and receive timely messages?  Information systems personnel – are there sufficient IS personnel to perform current and projected processing tasks?  Control – are rules and procedures for system use and access acceptable? Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703  Training – are there adequate training programmes and provisions for both users and IS personnel?  Costs – are development and operating costs in line with what is expected?  Complexity – is the system overly complex and difficult to operate and maintain?  Reliability – is the system reliable?  Efficiency – is the computer system efficient?  Response time – how long does it take the system to respond to users during peak processing times?  Documentation – is the documentation still valid? 4.3 Systems Performance Measurement Systems review often involves monitoring the system, called system performance measurement – which includes monitoring the number of errors encountered, the amount of memory required, the amount of processing or CPU time needed and other problems. Setting up benchmarks for performance measurement can be critical. System performance products have been developed to measure all components of the information system, including hardware, software, databases, telecommunications and network systems. When properly used, system performance products can quickly and efficiently locate actual or potential problems.

Computer waste involves the inappropriate use of computer technology and resources. It includes employees wasting computer resources and time by playing games and surfing the web, sending unnecessary emails, printing documents and other material that is then not read, developing systems that are not used to their full extent, and discarding old hardware when it could be recycled or given to charity. Computer-related mistakes refer to errors, failures and other computer problems that make computer output incorrect or not useful, caused mostly by human error. Despite many people’s distrust, computers themselves rarely make mistakes. Even the most sophisticated hardware cannot produce meaningful output if users do not follow proper procedures. Mistakes can be caused by unclear expectations and a lack of feedback. 1.1 Preventing Computer-Related Waste and Mistakes Toi remain profitable in a competitive environment, organisations must use all resources wisely. Preventing computer-related waste and mistakes should therefore be a goal. To achieve this goal involves the following:  Establishing Policies and Procedures The first step to prevent computer-related waste is to establish policies and procedures regarding efficient acquisition, use and disposal of systems and devices. Most companies have implemented stringent policies on the acquisition of computer systems and equipment, including requiring a formal justification statement before computer equipment is purchased, definition of standard computing platforms and the use of preferred vendors for all acquisitions. Prevention of computer-related mistakes begins by identifying the most common types of errors, of which there are surprisingly few. Types of computer-related mistakes include (but are not limited to) the following: o Data-entry or data-capture errors o Errors in computer programs o Errors in handling files o Mishandling of computer output o Inadequate planning for control of equipment malfunctions  Implementing Policies and Procedures Implementing policies and procedures to minimize waste and mistakes varies according to the type of business. Most companies develop such policies and procedures with advice from the firm’s internal auditing group or its external auditing firm. The policies often focus on the implementation of source data automation and the use of data editing to ensure data accuracy and completeness, at the assignment of responsibility for data accuracy within each information system.  Monitoring Policies and Procedures To ensure that users throughout an organisation are following established procedures, the next step is to monitor routine practices and take corrective action if necessary. By understanding what is happening in day-to-day activities, organisations can make adjustments or develop new policies.  Reviewing Policies and Procedures The final step is to review existing policies and procedures and determine whether they are adequate. During review, people should ask the following questions: o Do current policies cover existing practices adequately? Were any problems or opportunities uncovered during monitoring? Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 o Is the organisation planning any new activities in the future? If so, does it need new policies or procedures on who will handle them and what must be done? o Are contingencies and disasters covered? . Computer Crime Computer Crime is an act performed by a knowledgeable computer user, sometimes referred to as a hacker that illegally browses or steals a company’s or individuals’ private information. In some cases, this person or group of individuals may be malicious and destroy or otherwise corrupt the computer or data files. 2.1 Identity Theft Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes. It is a crime where an imposter obtains key pieces of personal identification information, such as date of birth, address, national insurance number and mother’s maiden name, and uses them to open accounts, get credit cards, loans, benefits and documents such as passports and driving licenses in the victim’s name. A wide range of methods are used by the perpetrators of these crimes, which makes investigating them difficult. Frequently, a critical computer password has been talked out of a person, or guessed based on a knowledge of the person, a practise called social engineering. 2.2 Cyberterrorism A cyberterrorist is someone who intimidates or coerces a government or organisation to advance his or her political or social objectives by launching computer-based attacks against computers, networks and the information stored on them. 2.3 Illegal Access and Use Crimes involving illegal system access and use of computer services are a concern to both government and business. Since the outset of information technology, computers have been plagued by criminal crackers. A cracker, often called a hacker, is a person who enjoys computer technology and spends time learning and using computer systems. Often they are “just looking” but could also be trying to corrupt files, steal data, or even transfer money. Script Kiddies admire crackers, but have little technical savvy. They are crackers who download programs called “scripts” that automate the job of breaking into computers. Insiders are employees, disgruntled or otherwise, working solo or in concert with outsiders to compromise corporate systems. Data and information are valuable corporate assets. The intentional use of illegal and destructive programs to alter or destroy data is as much a crime as destroying tangible goods. The most common of these programs are viruses and worms, which are software programs that when loaded into a computer system, will destroy, interrupt or cause errors in processing. virus is a computer program file capable of attaching to discs or other files and replicating itself repeatedly, typically without the user’s knowledge or permission. Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 A worm is a parasitic computer program that can create copies of itself on the infected computer or send copies to other computers via a network. Trojan horse is a malicious program that disguises itself as a useful application and purposefully does something the user does not expect. As a result of the increasing threat of viruses and worms, most computer users and organisations have installed antivirus programs on their computers. An antivirus program is software that runs in the background to protect your computer from dangers lurking on the Internet and other possible sources of infected files. 2.4 Equipment Theft During illegal access to computer systems, data can be stolen. In addition to data theft and software, all types of computer systems and equipment have been stolen from offices. Mobile computers such as laptops and smartphones are especially easy for thieves to take. Very often, the data stored on these devices is more valuable than the device itself. To fight computer crime, many companies use devices that disable the disc drive and/or lock the computer to the desk. 2.5 Software and Internet Software Privacy Like books and movies – and other intellectual properties – software is protected by copyright laws. Often, people who would never think of plagiarizing another author’s written work have no qualms about using and copying software programs they have not paid for. Such illegal duplicators are called “pirates”; the act of illegally duplicating software is called software piracy. Internet piracy can take several forms, including the following:  Pirate websites that make software available for free or in exchange for uploaded programs  Internet auction sites that offer counterfeit software, which infringes copyright  Peer-to-peer networks, which enable unauthorised transfer of copyrighted programs 2.6 Computer-Related Scams Using the Internet, scam artists offer get-rich-quick schemes involving bogus property deals, tout “free” holidays with huge hidden costs, commit bank fraud, offer fake telephone lotteries, sell worthless penny stocks and promote illegal tax-avoidance schemes. The following is a list of tips to help you avoid becoming a scam victim:  Don’t agree to anything in a high-pressure meeting or seminar  Don’t judge a company based on appearances  Avoid any plan that pays commissions simply for recruiting additional distributors  Beware of “shills”, people paid by a company to lie about how much they’ve earned and how easy the plan was to operate  Beware of a company’s claim that it can set you up in a profitable home-based business but that you must first pay up front to attend a seminar and buy expensive materials  If you are interested in starting a home-based business, get a complete description of the work involved before you send any money  Get in writing the refund, buy-back and cancellation policies of any company you deal with  If you need advice about an online solicitation or if you want to report a possible scam, contact your country’s computer crime unit Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703 3. Preventing Computer-Related Crime Because of increased computer use, greater emphasis is placed on the prevention and detection of computer crime. All over the world, private users, companies, employees and public officials are making individual and group efforts to curb computer crime, and recent efforts have met with some success. The following list provides a set of useful guidelines to protect your computer from criminal hackers:  Install strong user authentication and encryption capabilities on your firewall  Install the latest security patches, which are often available at the vendor’s Internet site  Disable guests accounts and null user accounts that let intruders access the network without a password  Do not provide overfriendly logon procedures for remote users  Restrict physical access to the server and configure it so that breaking into one server won’t compromise the whole network  Give each application its own dedicated server  Turn audit trails on  Consider using caller ID  Install a corporate firewall between your corporate network and the Internet  Install antivirus software on all computers and regularly download vendor updates  Conduct regular IS security audits  Verify and exercise frequent data back-ups for critical data To help prevent crime on the Internet, the following steps can be taken:  Develop effective Internet usage and security policies for all employees  Use a stand-alone firewall with network monitoring capabilities  Deploy intrusion detection systems, monitor them and follow up on their alarms  Monitor managers and employees to make sure that they are using the Internet for business purposes  Use Internet security specialists to perform audits of all Internet and network activities 4. Privacy Privacy is a big issue for many people. When information is computerised and can be processed and transferred easily, augmented and collated, summarised and reported, privacy concerns grow. Some of the steps that you can take to protect personal privacy include the following:  If you are concerned about what information a company is holding on you, use the Data Protection Act to find out what is stored about you in existing databases  Be careful when you share information about yourself. Don’t share information unless it is absolutely necessary  Be vigilant in insisting that your doctor, bank or financial institution does not share information about you with others without your written consent  Be proactive to protect your privacy  When purchasing anything from a website, make sure that you safeguard your credit card numbers, passwords and personal information Downloaded by ryan petersen (ryanpetersen648@gmail.com) lOMoARcPSD|8861703","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
