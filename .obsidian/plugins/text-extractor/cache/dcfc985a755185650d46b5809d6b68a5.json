Do a thorough comparison of A* and UCS. Refer to search types, optimality, efficiency, time and space complexity, as well as the main differences in the working of the algo- rithms (for example, when goal tests are performed, how selection of nodes work, etc.). i Choose one of the above algorithms (A* search or UCS) and provide an example which shows step-by-step how the algorithm will find a path to a goal. You may use any state-space that you deem sufficient to illustrate the search process. i. Draw the search space for your example (either tree or graph), indicate the start and goal states. ii. Show step-by-step how the algorithm will find the path from start to goal. Show the node generation, expansion, as well as any data structures that are required to perform the search.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
