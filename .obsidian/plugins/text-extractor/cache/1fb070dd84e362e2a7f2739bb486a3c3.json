Question 1 Total: 20 marks For this question, you need access to a web browser connected to the Internet. MyUnisa has been recently revamped, it has a new look and lots of functionalities. The new website has not been tested for usability and user experience. It is not known how students and other users of the website could react to the usability of the website. Visit the myUnisa web page and briefly familiarize yourself with the material on the web page and the way a user can interact with it and then evaluate it to answer the following questions. 1.1 Define usability and user experience (2). Answer: Usability (1 mark), p. 22 - Refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective, enjoyable from the user’s perspective. (Usability goals are effectiveness, efficiency, safety, utility, learnability and memorability.) User experience (1 mark), pp. 12-15 - Refers to how a product behaves and is used by people in real world. It is about how people feel about a product and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, opening and closing it. 1.2 Based on the material in the prescribed book and any other related material, compile a set of usability goals that you think are most relevant in evaluating the site. Use the following table structure to (i) list six usability goals, (ii) to explain the meaning of each goal, and (iii) to formulate a question that you would use to evaluate the site.

And involves thinking through how ideas will support or extend the way people interact and communicate. 2.1.2 Interface metaphors (2 marks), pp. 45-47 - Metaphor = “A thing considered representative of another thing” - Are considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. They provide a structure that is similar in some ways to aspects of a familiar entity/s, but that also have their own behaviours and properties. Such models can be based on an activity / object / both. It is instantiated in some way as part of the user interface e.g.: the desktop metaphor, the search engine. - Are intended to provide familiar entities that enable people to readily understand the underlying conceptual model and know what to do at an interface. 2.1.3 Paradigm (2 marks), p. 55 - refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices; - Interaction paradigms include: the WIMP interface, ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing, wearable computing, tangible bits, attentive environments, and the Workaday World 2.1.4 Theory (2 marks), pp. 54, 57 - Explanation of a phenomenon – e.g. information processing that explains how the mind, or some aspect of it, is assumed to work - Can help identify factors – e.g. cognitive, social, and affective, relevant to the design and evaluation of interactive products 2.1.5 Framework (2 marks), pp. 54, 57-8 - A framework is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions - Frameworks tend to be prescrip concepts, questions, and tive, providing designers with principles to consider 2.2 Discuss the purpose and core components of conceptual models and apply these to a typical online shopping system. (10) Answer: See Preece, Rogers, Sharp, 4th ed., Chapter 2, p. 41-44. The purpose of a conceptual model is to provide a high level description of how a system is organised and operates; it provides a framework of general concepts and their relationships allowing designers to get a clear understanding of the requirement for starting to code. (2) Components: a) Metaphors and analogies – conve sed for (1) y to people what a product is u b) The concepts that people are exposed to through the product / Task domain objects, and their operations and their attributes and operations (1) c) The relationship between the concepts (objects) (1) INF3720/102 5 d) The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (1) Application: a) Metaphors – an online shop allows users to browse for items, to put them into a virtual shopping trolley, and to pay for the items (1) b) Attributes and prices of products selecting and deselecting items; ; verbal description; photos; payments (1) c) Relationships: similar products shown; other products shown that are often bought together; customer’s details, balance and shopping history (1) d) Mappings: how often does the customer browse for items and how often does (s)he actually buy something? How often does the customer return to the site? How does online shopping change the way we shop and think about shopping? (1) Question 3 Total: 20 marks 3.1 Social interaction is central to humans’ everyday life. Describe how social media have changed the way in which people interact. (10) Answer: See Preece, Rogers, Sharp, 4th ed., Chapter 4, p. 107-110.  People are used to face-to-face communication which allows not only talking and listening but also taking into account visual clues such as facial expressions (1).  The telephone overcame distance and time barriers but limited communication to audible signs (1).  Messaging apps allows video calls, video conferencing and texting (1).  These technologies lack the richness of face-to-face communication and people compensate for these constraints by talking louder, using emoticons or projecting themselves more (1).  Social media apps allow one-to-many broadcasting (1), is immediate (1) and can be one-sided (1).  People switch easily between different technologies depending on the context (texting; emailing; chatting) (1).  Messages can easily be sent to the wrong receiver (1). Reliability of messages can be a problem (1). 3.2 Discuss telepresence and co-presence as areas where computer tools and services support people who cannot be physically present during a meeting or social gathering. (10) Answer (p. 111-127):  Telepresence technologies projec ons, voice and facial expressions t people’s body movements, acti (1) to give the appearance that they are present in the meeting (1). Images of a person can be superimposed on a workspace (1). Remote people can appear life-like (1). Wearable devices could send hugs (recreated by transmitted buzzes, skin warmth and heart rate) to remote friends (1).  Co-presence: shareable interfaces enable more than one person to use them at the same time to enhance co-located collaboration and gaming (1). o Physical coordination: voice and gestures used in face-to-face communication (1) o Awareness: a combination of direct observation and peripheral monitoring / situational awareness facilitates interdependent teamwork (1). 6 o Shareable interfaces exploit and simulate existing forms of coordination and awareness mechanisms to encourage more equitable participation in groups (1). Social translucence visualise social interactions and could be used to encourage people to socialise more. (1) Question 4 Total: 20 marks 4.1 With reference to emotional interaction, compare pleasurable interfaces (and other positive design elements) with annoying interfaces (and other negative design elements). (10) Answer: See Preece, Rogers, Sharp, 4th ed., Chapter 5, p. 131-156. Pleasurable inter faces Annoying interfaces a) Products that look, feel and sound good (visceral design) a) Appearance of interface is too noisy, garish, gimmicky or patronising. b) Design at the behavioral level (good usability) and reflective level (product has meaning and personal value for the user) b) A system does not work properly or crashes or is not relevant for the user, etc. c) Expressive interfaces (communicate status of a systems efficiently) to provide reassuring feedback c) Error messages that are vague or obtuse. d) Anthropomorphism – simulating human attributes to make technology more fun d) Unethical persuasive technologies/deceptive technology. e) Zoomorphism – simulating animal attributes to motivate people or to put them in a good mood. e) Badly designed interfaces make people frustrated or angry. 4.2 Discuss how the design of a technology can change the attitude and behaviour of people (10 marks). Answer: Pp 24-25, 146-152 (Allocate 3 marks for explaining how technology can change attitude and behaviour of people and 7 marks for discussion each of the strategies that can be used for designing persuasive technologies.) - Interactive computing systems deliberately designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviours in a predetermined way. For example, to persuade people to join good cause, give up bad habits, donate money, etc. - The study of computers as a persuasive technology is known as Captology. - The definition put emphasis on the intentionality of persuasion, which is aim the designer of the software. - Successful application of persuasive technologies has been reported in marketing, health, safety and environment. Students are required to provide examples of persuasive technologies that are popular in each of the given categories. - Strategies that are employed in designing technologies in order to change people’s attitude and behaviour include: (Note; students may describe each of the following strategies in their own words or by the use of examples) INF3720/102 7 o Just in time persuasion o Simulating experience o Personalizing o Recommendation o Monitoring and tracking o Competition and recognition o Visualizing the personalities in virtual communities - Persuasive technologies have some disadvantages, especially deception. Question 5 Total: 20 marks 5.1 What are the five key issues that determine the success of a data gathering exercise? (10 marks). Answer: Chapter 7, Pp 227-230 Five key issues that require attention for data gathering are: - Goal setting o Decide which data to collect, data collection techniques and the analysis to be carried - Identifying participants o The population o The sample o Sampling criteria - The relationship between data collector and the data provider o Issues of ethics o Professional o Informed consent - Triangulation o Investigating a phenomenon from at least two different perspectives o Types of triangulation: data, investigator, theories and methods - Pilot studies o Trial run of the main study 5.2 Several e-readers for reading e-books, watching movies or viewing pictures are available on the market. The exact design differs between models but they support book reading that is intended to be as comfortable as reading a paper book. The developers of a new e-reader want to find out how appealing it will be to young people under the 18 years of age. To this end, they have asked you to conduct some interviews for them. You are required to answer the following questions in preparation for the interview: 5.2.1 What is the goal of your data gathering session? (2) 5.2.2 List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the interview. (3) 5.2.3 What are the disadvantages of taking notes during the interviews? (2) 5.2.4 Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals. (3) 8 Answer: Chapter 7, pp 233-243. 5.2.1 What is the goal of your data gathering session? (2 mark) The goal is to seek opinions about whether e-readers would be appealing to people under the age of 18 years. 5.2.2 List any three techniques th g the interview. (3 marks at could be used for capturin  Audio recording  Video recording  Taking notes 5.2.3 What are the disadvantages of taking notes during an interview? (2 marks)  Taking notes might be cumbersome,  distracting to the interviewee  could be easy to miss some important notes. 5.2.4 Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals (3 marks)  Have used an e-reader before?  Would like to read a book using an e-reader?  In your opinion, is an e-reader easy to handle?  What do like most about an e-reader?  What do you like least about an e-reader? © Unisa 2019","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
