The importance of involving users during the design of a computer information system is that it allows developers to gain a better understanding of users’ goals, which leads to a more appropriate, more usable product. Expectation management and ownership are equally as important to design a usable product. Expectation management is the process of making sure that the users’ expectations of the new product are realistic. The purpose of expectation management is to ensure that there are no surprises for users when the product arrives. If users feel they have been cheated by promises that have not been fulfilled, then this will cause resistance and even rejection. Marketing of the new arrival must be careful not to misrepresent the product, although it may be particularly difficult to achieve with a large and complex system (Nevo and Wade, 2007). Expectation management tries to avoid misleading users; it tries to avoid exaggerating marketing hype. According to (Preece, Rogers, Sharp 2015), It is better to exceed users’ expectations than to fall below them. This does not mean adding more features, it simply means that the product supports the users’ goals more effectively than they expect. Involving users throughout development helps with expectation management because they can see from an early stage what the product's capabilities are. They will also understand better how it will affect their jobs and lives, and why the features are designed that way. Adequate and timely training is another technique for managing expectations. If users have the chance to work with the product before it is released, through training or hands-on demonstrations of a pre-release version, then they will understand better what to expect when the final product is available. A second reason for user involvement is ownership. Users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product's. Question 2 Assume that you are involved in developing a new mobile phone e-learning site for a high school mathematics course. Suggest ways of applying the user- centered principles in this task. There are three principles that lead to a user centred approach which are Early focus on users and tasks, Empirical measurement and Iterative design 1. Early focus on users and tasks – this first principle can be further broken down into five categories which are: i) Users’ tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development. Encouraging the higher-grade learners to be involved in the development. Make it compulsory for each and every learner from Grade 8 – 12 to bring some creative ideas on the table. Some prizes will be offered to the Top 3 students who bring creative ideas. Page 3 INF3720 Assignment 2 Stu No: 34759050 ii) Users’ behaviour and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them.  Support structures will be implemented to support communication between the users (learners) and the designers. Systems will be put in place to ensure that learners are involved throughout the development process. The reason for user Involved user involvement is ownership. Users who are involved, feel that they have contributed to a product's design processes. iii) Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for.  As humans, we are prone to making errors, we have certain limitations, both cognitive and physical. Products that are designed to support humans should consider these limitations, this will ensure that mistakes are limited. Some characteristics may be associated more with the particular task at hand. We need to capture those specific to the intended user group.  Learners physical aspects include height or strength, some characteristics are general like one learner in every 12 has some form of colour blindness, some characteristics may be associated with a particular task. If the learners encounter problems, I would encourage them to form user groups in order to solve the problem. iv) Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to the latest and their input is taken into account.  User’s involvement is organized; it is important that users are respected by designers.  Learners will also be allowed to create a user profile on the system, the user profile will have a unique username and password in order to ensure Learner’s confidentiality, this will also show learners that the designers respect for their privacy. v) All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work and their environment.  This does not necessarily mean that users will be actively involved in design decisions. As long as designers remain aware of the users while making their decisions, then this principle will be upheld.  Learners will answer questions incorporated in a form of a puzzle. If a learner achieves. A reward will be offered for successfully completing the puzzle within the required timeframe. Page 4 INF3720 Assignment 2 Stu No: 34759050 2. The second principle is: Empirical Measurement  Specific usability and user experience goals should be identified, clearly documented, and agreed upon at the start of the project. They can help designers to choose between alternative designs and to check on progress as the product is developed. Identifying specific goals up front means that the product can be empirically evaluated at regular stages as it is developed.  Leaners should be asked to come up with drawings of their expectations of the e-learning site. Learners know what they want, they know what will make their learning experience easy. Their experience in using their mobile devices will come in handy in coming up with designs. 3. The third principle is: Iterative Design: Iteration allows designs to be refined based on feedback. As users and designers engage with the domain and start to discuss requirements, needs, hopes, and aspirations, then different insights into what is needed, what will help, and what is feasible will emerge. This leads to a need for iteration, for the activities to inform each other and to be repeated. However good the designers are and however clear the users may think their vision is of the required artefact, it will be necessary to revise ideas in light of feedback several times. This is particularly true when trying to innovate. Innovation rarely emerges whole and ready to go. It takes time, evolution, trial and error, and a great deal of patience. Iteration is inevitable because designers never get the solution right the first time Gould and Lewis, 1985). There should be clear communication lines between designers and learner or users. Learners must be kept informed through regular newsletter or other channels of communication. Provided they are able to influence the development process through workshops or similar events, this can be an effective approach to expectation management and ownership. Question 3 This question takes you through the complete software development lifecycle for an interactive product. You are required to design and evaluate an interactive product for booking tickets online for a cinema. A user is supposed to be able to book a venue for watching a movie. Most cinema venues have an online booking facility already, but it can be awkward and frustrating to identify and book the seats you want. In order for you to successfully answer this question, study the model answer provided under additional resources (Assignment 02 – Question 03.pdf). Page 5 INF3720 Assignment 2 Stu No: 34759050 3.1 Identify five users’ needs (requirements) for the online facility. Record your data in point form. The user wants the following:  The system must display the amount due before the user login to make payment  The system must be multilingual to provide communication to common official languages  The system must cater for people with disabilities whether the person is deaf or in wheelchair  Select the movie, choose appropriate date and time  Select the preferred seating arrangement  Make a payment quickly and securely using credit card  Receive a reference and a ticket after paying online 3.2 Based on the user requirements, choose a user profile and produce one persona and one scenario, capture how the user is expected to interact with the product. User Profile: A user profile for a male aged 25 who is partially blind. Scenario Thabo likes social media networking, his favourite is facebook and twitter. As he is partially blind he makes use of the features that help visually impaired users access photos and timelines on social networks. On this day Thabo was checking his twitter feeds when he came across the latest movie now showing Black Panther. In order to read his feed, he uses a screen reader. He normally spends his weekends with his family in Soweto, he decided to spend this weekend with his friend in Honeydew. Thabo and his friend decided that they want to go to the local cinema to watch Black Panther. He decided to use google search to get to the Cinema website. Once on the website Thabo checks for the movies currently showing. The structure of the site is quite clear, and it’s possible to go straight to the information about films and showing times. Black Panther movie is indeed showing. The web page allows him to select the movie of his choice, the preferred time and preferred seats. He selected the 2 pm slot, but the system indicated that the 2pm Sunday movie is fully-booked and offers him alternatives: the 5 pm and the 8pm slots are available. The system displays the seating plan for the cinema which shows the available seats for each showing, and the cost. Thabo then choose the seats of his choice and his new preferred time 5 pm, he confirms the booking, and pays for it using his credit card. As he is partially blind, he needs to double-check that the movie comes with a narration service called Audio description and that the Cinema has special headphones for the visually impaired users. He also wants to check if the Cinema is equipped with suitable sound amplification technology that links in to his hearing aid. Having completed his order, he returns to his twitter feed to check the latest news. Page 6 INF3720 Assignment 2 Stu No: 34759050 3.3 Perform a task analysis on the main tasks associated with the ticket booking system, i.e. booking a ticket. 1. Finding if the film was on at the cinema. 2. Finding out the times of the showing. 3. Choosing the showing. 4. Choosing the seat. 5. Confirming the booking. 6. Paying for the booking. 7. Checking for other facilities at the cinema 8. Checking for feedback and comments about the Cinema 3.4 Using the data gathered in 3.1 and your subsequent analysis, identify different kinds of requirements for the product under the following headings: environmental, user and usability. Environmental (physical. Social, organisational, technical) The user might be in a variety of physical settings, and at different times of day, for example, at home, in the street, in the rain etc. In the scenario Thabo was in bed using a Laptop, there is a possibility that he was using another mobile device tablet or Cell phone. User There are potentially many different kinds of users. That particular website is for adults 18 and above and it also caters for people with disability. Users should be adults who can make payments using credit or debit cards. Usability The website is user-friendly, readily accessible without any training. Question 4 Go to myUnisa under Additional resources and download the file “Case study – Academic library. pdf”. Read the case study and answer the following questions. 4.1 What was the purpose of the usability evaluation? The purpose of the usability evaluation was to determine the effectiveness and ease of use of an academic library web sites for the performance of specific tasks. Page 7 INF3720 Assignment 2 Stu No: 34759050 4.2 Which challenges were encountered in carrying the usability testing of the website? i. Privacy of the testing room to allow participants to talk comfortably without fear ii. Securing a place to carry out the experiment iii. Participants had varying learning abilities and technical proficiency iv. Difficulties in interpreting the results due to subjective nature of variables such as aesthetics and idiosyncrasies. 4.3 List the main tasks used in the usability testing of the website.  Task 1: Identify an item/title that is part of the Libraries’ collections; Task 2: Locate the most appropriate resource for finding journal articles on a topic; Task 3: Find an appropriate starting point for research on a topic; 4.4 Which data collection methods were used to collect data? i. Direct observation of users being tested. ii. Think aloud. iii. A written log of events that took place during testing. iv. A record of user movements during navigation. v. Post evaluation report by the tester. 4.5 List any five issues discovered by the usability testing. i. Participants confused by the meaning of, “Online Resources” and “Library Catalogues,” which resulted in failing to satisfy the “causes few errors” measure. ii. The “Web Search” and “Need Help” links failed the” easy to learn” measure. iii. The process of connecting to the catalogue through the “Web-interface link” was unnecessarily unpleasant. iv. “Online Resources” page was difficult to decipher. v. Users did not find the “Online Resources” page easy to use when searching an article from a named database. Participants could not identify the database titles.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
