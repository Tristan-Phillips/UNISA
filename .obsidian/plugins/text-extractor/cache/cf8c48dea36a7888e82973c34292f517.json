Memorability and cognitive stimulation P19 11 Virtual shopping carts, baskets, shelves, checkouts, cash registers, payment options and alternative online shopping techniques show: 1. How future scenarios (visions) enable users to interact with information in their everyday lives P92 (for my answer) 2. How conceptual models provide scenarios of how society can use future generations of imagined technologies 3. How theories help identify factors relevant to the design and evaluation of interactive products 4. How seemingly similar tasks can have quite different conceptual models and metaphors underlying their design 12 What is the difference between user experience and usability? 1. User experience is the way people feel about a software product, while usability means to what extent a product enables people to be highly productive in their work. 2. Usability is the way people feel about a software product, while user experience means to what extent a product enables people to be highly productive in their work. 3. User experience refers to the effectiveness and efficiency of a software product, while usability refers to pleasurability and satisfaction. 4. Usability refers to the desirable aspects of a software product, while user experience refers to its learnability. P19 13 Which aspect is NOT a benefit of conceptualising the design space? 1. Orientation 2. Open-mindedness 3. Requirements specification 4. Common ground P74 14 Which definition of interaction design is correct? 1. The extent to which a product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they want to P9 2. Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday lives 3. Ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction or interpretation that can take place at a given moment 4. How good a product is at doing what it is supposed to do 15 Which definition of interaction types that underlie the user experience is correct? 1. Users manipulate objects in a virtual or physical space by opening, holding, closing and placing them 2. Selecting options from a menu is an example of manipulating objects in a virtual space 3. Responding is when users have a dialog with a system like speaking via an interface to which the system replies via text output 4. Browsing is where users move through a virtual environment P81 16 Which description of emotional interaction is correct? 1. Emotional interaction aims to automate the measurements of feelings when interacting with technologies 2. Emotional interaction is concerned with the recognition, simulation and elicitation of human feelings and reactions when interacting with technologies 3. Emotional interaction is the study of software systems that can recognise and simulate human affects when interacting with technologies 4. Emotional interaction is the design of technology that can trigger desired emotional states when interacting with technologies ? P167 17 Which design principle below is correct? 1. Visibility refers to interfaces that have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks 2. Feedback is an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it intuitively 3. Affordance is an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it intuitively 4. Constraints refers to interfaces that have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks P30 18 Which one of Shneiderman’s classic guidelines for error messages is violated by the following computer message: “The application Word Wonder has unexpectedly quit due to a type 2 error”? 1. Error messages should be precise rather than vague 2. Error messages should avoid context-sensitive help 3. Error messages should avoid friendly cute images 4. Error messages should provide precise error code numbers Chapter 6 slides 19 Which option is a good example of co-presence? 1. Podcasts are used to stream audio-based lectures to distance education students 2. Video and sound with fixed cameras and microphones are used for staff meetings where the participants are working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic 3. In a large computer lab with partitions between each student, the face of a student who is participating in a discussion is projected on all the computer screens in all the booths. 4. A roaming robot that can hear and talk, represents a conference attendee (who is in quarantine) during a networking session in teatime P150 20 Which option is NOT a basic activity in the process of interaction design? 1.

Systems analysis and design P50 21 Which option is NOT a user-centred design principle? 1. Early focus on users and tasks 2. Linear design 3. Empirical measurement using quantifiable and measurable usability criteria 4. Iterative design P48 22 Which source of conceptual inspiration and knowledge is described correctly? 1. Mappings refer to the graphical representation of conceptual maps 2. Concoctions represent the abstraction of product attributes as a means to invoke user experience 3. Metaphor is a figure of speech that convey to people to understand what a software product is for and how it should be used 4. An example of relationships between concepts is revisiting a web page through looking at a list of visited sites P74 23 Which source of conceptual inspiration that guides design is defined correctly? 1. A model is a set of core concepts, questions or principles for designing user experience or analysing human-computer interaction data P93 2.

A paradigm is a simplification of some aspect of HCI used by designers to evaluate alternative designs 24 Which statement regarding emotional interaction is correct? 1. An appealing interface should always be avoided when it can affect the usability of an interface negatively by slowing it down 2. Phishing is an example of an aesthetically pleasing interface 3. Pleasurable interfaces provide dull, utilitarian designs 4. Expressive interfaces provide reassuring feedback but can be intrusive P190 25 Which statement regarding interaction design phases is correct? 1.
