Why is this such an important part of deﬁning state descriptions? (3) Solution: Abstraction is when we remove detail from the state description without loss of generality . It is important since it allows us to remove detail that is irrelevant to the problem and in doing so we are ignoring attributes which could lead to information overload, which may provide a better way to solve the problem. It is important to realise that abstraction is a bit of an art – sometimes we can remove too much, and then we are even worse of. (b) Consider the following diagram: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z AA AB i. Assume that an A-star search is employed, and L is the goal (moves can only be made horizontally and vertically, the cost to move from one square to the next is 1, and the Manhattan-distance heuristic 1 is employed). Suppose the start is S. Show the frontier after S is expanded. Include ˆf , ˆg, and ˆh values for each node (path) you place in the frontier. (6) Solution: Here we should pay very careful attention to the different nodes that are involved in the search. We have nodes in the prob- lem (the grid provided above), and nodes in the search (nodes in the search tree). Lets redraw the grid so that it becomes something you may recognise more easily: 1 Counts the number of horizontal and vertical moves that should be made from one node to another, and ignores obstacles, i.e. every block is considered to be a valid place to move to, wether there is an obstacle there or not.

Note that for the heuristic we need to make sure that we use the correct values for actual cost between nodes. This includes nodes that do have barriers between them (using the Manhattan distance heuristic means we ignore barriers – we act as though there would have been intermediate nodes to pass through on our way from one node to another). This means we use the following ˆg for nodes: From To Distance R S 2 N O 2 X J 3 J B 2 K C 2 O P 2 K L 2 F G 4 C D 2 In all other cases the distance is considered 1 (ˆg = 1). The other important thing is that we need to know how A* works. A* choose the node from the frontier with the lowest ˆ(f ) value. But now we are not talking about nodes in the map any more. The simplest so- lution is to use nodes in the frontier which record information about the paths that have been explored during the search. Such an approach is easy, since we simply tack on a node from the grid to the path-node that is expanded. Taking all of this into account we have the frontier as below. {< Y, S, ( ˆ(g) = 1, ˆ(h) = 5, ˆ(f ) = 6) >, < O, S, (1, 3, 4) >, < T, S, (1, 3, 4) > } ii. What will be the maximum number of nodes that will be expanded using the A-star search (in the worst case)? Clearly explain your answer. (7) [TURN PAGE] ANSWERS/SOLUTIONS 7 COS3751 Sample Question Paper Solution: 6, S as the start node [1], T and O have an f-value of 4, in the worst case O is chosen, which leads to O being expanded [2], K is placed on the frontier, K has an f-value of 4 as well, in the worst case K is chosen and expanded [3]which places J on the frontier. J has an f-value of 6 which makes T the next node chosen from the frontier [4], this places Z, and U on the frontier, U has the lowest f-value and will be chosen for expansion [5], this places AA, V, and P on the frontier. P has the lowest f-value and is expanded [6]. L is not expanded since the goal test for both the tree and graph based searches are done before expansion. (c) Consider the following diagram: A B E F C G K L H J D I Assume that a depth-ﬁrst search is employed, and that the goal node is K. Write down the nodes in the order they are generated in order to reach the goal. Expansion must proceed in a left to right fashion (hint: remember that a depth-ﬁrst search uses a LIFO queue). (5) Solution: Remember: expansion means we take a node from the frontier, and we perform an action on it. We may perform a goal test on the node we take from the node when we expand (depending on the algorithm). Generation means the nodes that result from performing the action on the node chosen for expansion). Also remember that DFS uses a last in ﬁrst out queue (a stack is an ex- ample of a LIFO queue), so if we want to expand G before A, we should place A on the stack before G. Additionally: DFS can either be a graph based, or a tree based search. We use the graph based search below. You can also employ a variation in which you recursively descend into the children nodes – however, for our answer to this question we stick to a LIFO queue and the graph based version.
