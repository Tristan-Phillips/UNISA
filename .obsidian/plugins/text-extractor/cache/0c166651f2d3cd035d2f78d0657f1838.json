Conceptually speaking, it does the “right thing”. Fully observable, because the players’ sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time, i.e. they can see every state.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Elements of the problem are the initial state, actions and transition model implicitly defines it, together. State representation: S ={A1,A2,A3,C1,C2} which represents the people who have not yet crossed yet. The elements in the set represent the people who have not yet crossed. An ampty set represents that everyone have crossed. The initial state: S = { A1,A2,A3, C1, C2} The notation represents a set, the elements in the set are the people who want to cross. If they are in the set it means that they have not crossed yet and if they are not it means that they have crossed. Initially no one has crossed that is why all the people are in the set. The symbol S means state. {} symbols means the set. A1 representing Adult 1 A2 representing Adult 2 A3 representing Adult 3 C1 representing Child 1 C2 representiong Child 2 Breadth-first search is a simple strategy in which the root node is expanded first, then all the successors of the root node are expanded next, then their successors, and so on. In general, all the nodes are expanded at a given depth in the search tree before any nodes at the next level are expanded. When applying it to a tree or graph, it expands the node with the shortest path from the frontier. Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm with a branching factor of β at depth δ: o Has a complexity of O(β δ ) o This is an exponential growth Space/Complexity gets large quickly Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year? Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace E.g. =b^d =6^7 =279,94 Breadth-first-search uses a FIFO queue. Depth -first search always expands the deepest node in the current frontier of the search tree. Depth-first search uses a LIFO queue. The. search proceeds immediately to the deepest level of the search tree, where the nodes have no successors. As those nodes are expanded, they are dropped from the frontier, so then the search \"backs up\" to the next deepest node that still has unexplored successors. The space complexity is linear E.g. = b.d 6x7=42 DFS has a clear space complexity advantage over BFS when a tree search is performed Property is consistency and the condition for it is h(n) < look it up For both tree-search and graph search A* needs to have the property of optimality. For tree-search A* is optimal of h(n) is admissible. For graph-search version A* is optimal if h(n) is consistent.

The difference between the global and local maxima is that Local minima/maxima are local solutions in the search space that are optimal solutions to the problem in the immediate neighbourhood (within a given range, there isn’t a solution that beats it). A global maxima/minimum is a solution to the problem that is the best solution in the entire solution space (no other solution beats it).

BFS uses a FIFO queue data structure and UCS uses a priority queue data structure. UCS finds the goal with the least amount of cost whilst in BFS we find the shallowest goal.

This is also what is called arc consistency if domains satisfies constraints. 𝐷𝑀12= { 2,3 } Why? Because to make 6 each row and column should have 1,2 and a 3. So if a 1 is picked we need a 2 or 3. 𝐷𝑀13= { 2,3} Same reason as the above one 𝐷𝑀21= {2,3} 𝐷𝑀22= {1,2,3} 𝐷𝑀23= {1,2,3} 𝐷𝑀31= {2,3} 𝐷𝑀32= {1,2,3} 𝐷𝑀33= {1,2,3} A resolution is a powerful rule of inference for propositional logic and a clausal sentence is either a literal or a disjunction of literals. However, the resolution closure is a rule that govern a set of clauses to know whether the clauses are satisfiable or not. If a set of clauses are unsatisfiable, the resolution closure of those clause contains the empty clause.

However, the resolution closure is a rule that govern set of clauses to know whether the clauses are satisfiable or not. If a set of clauses are unsatisfiable, the resolution closure of those clauses contains the empty clause. b) A  (B v C) (A => (B v C)) ^ ((BvC) => A) (!A v (B v C)) ^ (!(BvC) v A) (!A v B v C) ^ (!B ^ ! C) v A) Note: !A v (B v C) I can just take the brackets away (!A v B v C) ^ ( (!B v A) ^ (!C v A)) since these are all ^ I can drop the brackets (!A v B v C) ^ (!B v A) ^ (!C v A) Now since we have a ^(disjunction) of ‘X v X’(literals) we can stop Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year? Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace a) 1st convert all statements to CNF, i.e. clause form: 1. !P v !Q v R 2. !T v Q 3. !W v P 4. !R Nothing needed Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year? Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Then negate what we are trying to prove and using resolution with the CNF form statements we try to get the empty clause 1. !P v !Q v R 2. !T v Q 3. !W v P 4. !R 5. W ^ T This is the negation of what we are trying to prove 6. W 5 Whenver I have X ^ Y, then I can deduce X and Y from it 7. T 5 8. P 3&6 9. Q 2&7 10. !P v !Q 1&4 11. !Q 8&10 12. Ø 9&11 Thus we have proven W => !T since we arrived at the empty clause Question 7 a) i) E[6,4] = 0.97 (p=6/10 = 0.6) ii) Calculate the gain for each remaining attribute: Budget = b, Resources = r, Sentiment = s, On Target = ont Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year? Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Gb = 0,97 – ( Runder + Rover + Ront) = ( 0.2 * E[1,1] + 0.4 * E[2,2] + 0.4 * E[3,1] = 0.97 - ( 0.2 * 1 + 0.4 * 1 + 0.4 * 0.81) = 0.046 Gr = 0.97 – (Rava + Runder) = 0.97 - ( 0.8 * 0.93 + 0.2 * 1) note that Ravailable is E[5,3] which is p = 0.625, since it is in the middle of 2 table values we round up. Given in the picture above = 0.026 Gs = 0.97 – (Rpos + Rneg) = 0.97 – (0.5*0.97 + 0.5 * 0.97) = 0 Thus the next attribute should be Budget since it has the highest information gain value Practice Paper 1 Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year?
