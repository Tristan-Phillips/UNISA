Conceptually speaking, it does the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù. Fully observable, because the players‚Äô sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time, i.e. they can see every state.

State representation: S ={A1,A2,A3,C1,C2} which represents the people who have not yet crossed yet. The elements in the set represent the people who have not yet crossed. An ampty set represents that everyone have crossed. The initial state: S = { A1,A2,A3, C1, C2} The notation represents a set, the elements in the set are the people who want to cross. If they are in the set it means that they have not crossed yet and if they are not it means that they have crossed. Initially no one has crossed that is why all the people are in the set. The symbol S means state. {} symbols means the set. A1 representing Adult 1 A2 representing Adult 2 A3 representing Adult 3 C1 representing Child 1 C2 representiong Child 2 Breadth-first search is a simple strategy in which the root node is expanded first, then all the successors of the root node are expanded next, then their successors, and so on. In general, all the nodes are expanded at a given depth in the search tree before any nodes at the next level are expanded. When applying it to a tree or graph, it expands the node with the shortest path from the frontier. Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm with a branching factor of Œ≤ at depth Œ¥: o Has a complexity of O(Œ≤ Œ¥ ) o This is an exponential growth Space/Complexity gets large quickly Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year? Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace E.g. =b^d =6^7 =279,94 Breadth-first-search uses a FIFO queue. Depth -first search always expands the deepest node in the current frontier of the search tree. Depth-first search uses a LIFO queue. The. search proceeds immediately to the deepest level of the search tree, where the nodes have no successors. As those nodes are expanded, they are dropped from the frontier, so then the search \"backs up\" to the next deepest node that still has unexplored successors. The space complexity is linear E.g. = b.d 6x7=42 DFS has a clear space complexity advantage over BFS when a tree search is performed Property is consistency and the condition for it is h(n) < look it up For both tree-search and graph search A* needs to have the property of optimality. For tree-search A* is optimal of h(n) is admissible. For graph-search version A* is optimal if h(n) is consistent.

The difference between the global and local maxima is that Local minima/maxima are local solutions in the search space that are optimal solutions to the problem in the immediate neighbourhood (within a given range, there isn‚Äôt a solution that beats it). A global maxima/minimum is a solution to the problem that is the best solution in the entire solution space (no other solution beats it).

This is also what is called arc consistency if domains satisfies constraints. ùê∑ùëÄ12= { 2,3 } Why? Because to make 6 each row and column should have 1,2 and a 3.

However, the resolution closure is a rule that govern a set of clauses to know whether the clauses are satisfiable or not. If a set of clauses are unsatisfiable, the resolution closure of those clause contains the empty clause.

BFS uses FIFO, since ones on l=the left is 1st in they must be the 1st ones to get out, Put new ones to the right Step Expand Frontier 1 A 2 A B C D 3 B C D E 4 C D E G H 5 D E G H J 6 E G H J L 7 We stop since we generated goal node 8 9 Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year?

However, the resolution closure is a rule that govern set of clauses to know whether the clauses are satisfiable or not. If a set of clauses are unsatisfiable, the resolution closure of those clauses contains the empty clause. b) A ÔÉ≥ (B v C) (A => (B v C)) ^ ((BvC) => A) (!A v (B v C)) ^ (!(BvC) v A) (!A v B v C) ^ (!B ^ !
