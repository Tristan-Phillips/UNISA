Optio 1n : p  q p q ,  is tr in ery world t Kripke modelue ev of he so it is in t Kripke true he model. Opti 2on : □ ◊ p □ ◊ p is not in since is not in all worlds accessible true x2 ◊ p true from x2. In pa icularrt , ◊ p is not true in since there are x3 no worlds accessible om fr x .3 Optio 3n : □ (p  q) p q ,  is in ery world t Kripke modeltrue ev of he so it is in any world true accessibl fre om every world, so it is tr in t Kripke modue he el. Optio 4n : p  ◊ q p , xis in worltrue ds x2 3 and x4 1, q and ◊ is in true x , p so  ◊ q is in altrue l worlds t Kripke modelof he . Optio 5n : □ p  ◊ q □ p is in worltrue ds x3 and x4 (since is in all worlds accessible om p true fr x3 and and ue and x4) ◊ q is tr in worlds x1 x2 (since x1 and x2 each ve ha a world accessibl fre om them in which q is true). QUESTION 6 If we interpret □  as be at \"It ought to th  \", which t foof he llowing formul correctly expresses t as he English sentence It ought to thabe t if I am y, I'm ahapp llowed to be unhappy. where p stan fo the dds r eclarative sentence \"I am happy\"? COS 61/237 03/1 5 Optio 1n : □ p ¬ p ◊ This f mula stat \"If I ought to happy, then I a to be or es be am llowed unhappy\", which is not the same as t declhe arative sentence. Optio 2n : ◊ ¬ p ¬  □ p This f mula is equivalent to which is equivalent to or ¬ ¬ p ¬ p, ◊  □ □ p  ¬ p, □ which states that \"If I ought to hap , then I ought not to bbe py e happy\", which is not the same as the decl ative sentence.ar Opti 3on : □ (p  ¬ □ p) ¬ p ¬ ¬ ¬ p ¬ □ is t same he as ◊ which is t same he as ◊ p. So t fhe ormula correctly presses t sentenceex he . Optio 4n : □ (p ¬  ◊ p) This f mula stat \"It ougor es ht to t case that if I happ then I am be he am y, not a to hapllowed be py\", which is not the same the declas arative sentence. Optio 5n : It is impossible to translate this sentence into formula a of modal logic with the required inter etatiopr n. See comment on Option 3. QUESTION 7 If we interpret □  as ue \"It is necessar y il tr that  \", why should t fo ula scheme he rm □    hold in this modality? Optio 1n : Because f all formul or as , it is necessar ue ily tr that if  then . This anation does not co ectly press the formulexpl rr ex a scheme. t I represents the fo ulrm a □ (  ). Opti 2on : Because for all formulas , if  is necessar trily ue, t n ihe t is true. This anation m es comm sense.expl ak on Optio 3n : Because f all formul or as , if  is no possiblt y true, then it is true. This anation represents t fo ula expl he rm ¬ ◊   , which is equivalent to ¬ ¬ ¬ □   , which is equivalent to □ ¬   . This is no same as the given formula scht the eme. Optio 4n : Because f all formul or as ,  is necessar y iil true f it is true. This explanation repr ents t formula which is equivalent to es he   □ , which is no the same t given formula schemet as he . Optio 5n : □    should not hold i ty.n this modali Yes it should. S Table 5.7 in t cribed bookee he pres . 6 QUESTION 8 If we inter et pr □  as \"A er any ex of ft ecution progr ham P,  olds\", why should t formula scheme he □    not h d i this modaol n lity? Opti 1on : Just because  holds after every exec P doesn't ut oni of necessarily m n t t ea ha  holds before execution of P. The formula scheme states \"If  holds after any execution progrof am P, then  h planatioolds\". The ex n follows from the common sense meaning of this sentence, which is incorrect. Optio 2n : Because it is no the case that t after any ex P, if ecution of  holds then  holds. This anation presses t formula scheme expl ex he □ (  ) which is no same as t given formula scht the he eme. Optio 3n : Because if  does not hold before ex of P it doecution , esn't necessarily mean that  holds after any execution of P. This anation expr ses the formula scheme expl es   □  which is n t same as t given formula schemot he he e. Optio 4n : Because if  does not h d afteol r every ex P, it doecution of esn't necessarily mean that  holds before any execution of P. This anation presses t f mula scheme expl ex he or ¬ □    . Although it may be cor ulrect that this sho d not h d iol n this moda ty, this formula scheme is not the same li as the given formula scheme. Optio 5n : □    should h d iol n this moda tyli , be use ica f  holds after any execution of P, then  h ds.ol This is not correct, b ause say ec  represents the asse irt on tha \"t Hello world i es display d on he t screen.\" Then just because  holds after program P is executed, do n't mean that es Hello world is always displayed the screen (particularly before P ion s executed). QUESTION 9 If we inter et \" ways in t future (where t future does not i lude t present) it will pr □  as Al he he nc he be true that  \", which of t fo ng formulas should not be va he llowi lid? COS 61/237 03/1 7 Optio 1n : □ p  □ □ p This f mula should va because it states that if l always or be lid, p wil be true he in t future, then in t fhe uture, p will always be tr in t fue he uture. Optio 2n : ¬ □ p ¬ p ¬ ◊ ◊ This formula is equivalent to because □ p  □ □ p, ¬ ¬ ◊  is t samhe e as □ , ¬ and 1  2 is equivalent to 1  2. So it should vabe lid according to the argument or given f Option 1. Optio 3n : ¬ p p◊ ¬  □ This formula should be va d because is equivalen to li it t □ p p. □ Optio 4n : ¬ □ p □  ◊ ¬ p This f mula is equivalent to which is equivalent toor ¬ p ¬ ¬ ¬ p, □ □  □ □ p p.  □ □ So it should va d accordi to t argument given forbe li ng he Optio 1n . Optio 5n : □ □ p  ¬ □ p T mulhis for a i equivalen t so i shoul vas t o □ pp  □ □ , t d be lid according to the argument or given f Option 1. Please note that Questi 9 w not marked, because the fo ulas in all the s a va d, on as rm option re li an thed re is no inval a.id formul QUESTION 10 If we interpret □  as \"Agent A believes  \", what is t Eng sh translation of t fo ula p ¬ he li he rm □  ◊ q? Optio 1n : If Agent A believes p, then Agent B does not believe q. ◊ q does not r er to Agent B. It can expressef be ed as \"q is consistent with Agent A's beliefs\". Optio 2n : Agent A believ that if then q is es p, not consisten with Agen A's beliefs.t t This anation presses t fo ula expl ex he rm □ ( ¬ p  ◊ q) which is not the same as t given formulahe . Optio 3n : Agent A believes tha i p then t f , Agent B does not believe q. See comment on Option 1. Opti 4on : If Age A be then Agent lieves p, nt A be eves not q.li This anation expresses t formula expl he □ p  □ ¬ q which is t same the given f mula due to the as or he duality of □ and ◊. Optio 5n : Agent A believes p if Agent A believes not q. T pr shis anation expl ex es es t fo ula he rm □ ¬ q p  □ which is t converse ohe f the given formula.

Optio 5n : □ ¬ p  □ ¬ q This f mula is equivalent to due to equivalences 5.3 paor □ (¬ p ¬ q)  on ge 314 t pr cribed book, which is equivalent to of he es □ ¬ (p  q) due to De Morgan's rul See comment on Option 2.e. QUESTION 12 Consider t fohe llowing Kripke frame: x1 x2 x3 x4 Which of t fo modal logics does this ame conforhe llowing fr m to? Optio 1n : KT The relation is not refl ive because not all worlds are accessible fr themselvesex om , in pa icular rt x .4 Optio 2n : KB The n relatio i no sys t mme ictr , because no al p rs of worlds ar mutuallt l ai e y accessibl amplee. For ex , x2 is accessibl from e x1, but x1 is not accessible from x2. Optio 3n : KD The relation is not serial, because not ery world has a world which is accessiblev e from , in partiit cular x4. Opti 4on : K4 The relation is ansitive, because f all p rs worlds tr or ai of xi and xk such that there is an xj such that is accessiblxj e from xi, and xk is accessible from xj, then xk is accessible from x .i Optio 5n : KT45 The relation is not function because ery w ld is not accessible a mal ev or by aximum of d. one other worl For is accessible om three worlds, namely example, x3 fr x1, x2 and x3. COS 61/237 03/1 9 The following natural deduction proof (without re ons) is referr to in Questions 13, and 15: as ed 14 1 (p □  q) 2 p q  3 p 4 q 5 p □ 6 q □ 7 p □  □ q 8 (p p □  q)  (□  □ q) QUESTION 13 How man times are y □ elimination and introduction rules used in the above proof? Optio 1n : None See comment on Opti on 3. Optio 2n : □ elimination and □ introduction are both only ed once.us See comment on Opti on 3. Opti 3on : □ elimination is used only once but □ introduction twice. □ eliminati ion d is use n d line 2, an □ introduction is used in lines 5 and 6. e mination always occur somewher□ li e i ins de a dashed box, and i roduction a ays occur□ nt lw s somewhere aft a dashed boer x. Optio 4n : □ e is ed twice but limination us □ introduction only once. See comment on Opti on 3. Optio 5n : □ elimination and introductio□ n are both used twice. See comment on Opti on 3. QUESTION 14 What is the correct reason for steps 1, 2 and 3 of the above proof? 10 Optio 1n : 1 2 assumption axiom T in line 1 e 2 Although 1 line is an assumption ne is i, li 2 nside a dashed box, so it ut ses e mination, not axi ili □ li om T. Optio 2n : 1 2 premise i 1 □e 2 The first ne in a so d box is alwa assumptioli li ys an n. Optio 3n : 1 2 premise assumption i 2 The first ne in a so d box is alwa assumptioli li ys an n. Optio 4n : 1 2 □i 1 axiom T in line 2 i 3,4 The first ne in a so d box is always assumptioli li an n. Opti 5on : 1 2 3 assu timp on □e 1 e 2 The first fo ula i ide a (soli box is always an rm ns d) assumption, so the reas f 1 is co ect. Li 2 ion or line rr ne s inside a dashed bo so this is the app cation of x, li □ elimination. Line 3 is indeed an app cation of li  elimination app ed to line 2.li QUESTION 15 What seque is proved by the above proof? nt Optio 1n : □ □ (p  q) (p  q)  (□ p  □ q) There are emises in t seque because therno pr he nt e are assumptio outside of boxes i proof.no ns n the Optio 2n : □ □ (p  q) p  □ q If the fina st was omil ep tted, as wel as the bol x around nes to 7, the this wo d a va d sequent li 1 n ul be li for the proof. Opti 3on : □ (p  q)  (□ p q) □ Since is assumption, and □ (p  q) an □ p  □ q is proved in consequence i t same b , we can nside he ox use introduction to prove  □ (p q) p q)   (□  □ outside the box. nce no other assumptions o side Si ut the bo were x used, there are no premises of the sequent.

COS 61/237 03/1 11 The following i omplete natural deduction proof is referr to in Questions 17:nc ed 16 and 1 □ □ ¬ ¬ □ p assumption 2 3 ¬ □ p assumption 4 5  ¬e 2,4 6 □ p PBC 3-5 7 8 □ ¬ □ ¬ □ □ □ p  p i 1-7 QUESTION 16 Rules T, 4 and 5 are used in t missing lines of the above proof. Which rule is ed in which ne? he us li Optio 1n : Rule T is line 2, rule 4 iused in s us used in ne 4 and rule 5 is li ed in line 7. If we use rule T in li we w l get a negat fone 2, il ed rmula. We can o y use rule 4 a positive f so the nl on ormula, only valid application wo d 1 to produce ul be on line □ □ ¬ ¬ □ □ p. Similarly, we can o y use rule 5 nl on a negat catioed formul so t o y va d appa, he nl li li ns would be on lines 2 3 to produce or □ ¬□ ¬ □ p or □ □ ¬ p. Neither o these options wo d make st 8 cof ul ep rrect. Optio 2n : Rule 4 is ed in 2, rule 5 ius line s us need in li 4 and rule T is used in line 7. If rule 4 is app in it w l produce t formula lied line 2, il he □ □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p. To be able to use ¬e 2,4 in thline 5, e formula in 4 wo d have to line ul be ¬ ¬ ¬ p□ □ □ □ . Using rule 5 in ne 4 canli not produce this. Opti 3on : Rule T is used in li 2, rule 5 ine s used 4 in line 4 and rule is used in line 7. Since ¬e 2,4 is ed in t fous line 5, he rmulas in lines 2 and 4 must be t complements of one another. We he therefore need to use rule T in line 2 to s ip a box om tr fr the formula in line 1, and rule 5 i line 4 to add a box tn o the formula in line 3. Finally, we ne to use rule 4 ied n line 7 to add a box to t fo ula in he rm line 6. Optio 4n : Rule is ed i line 2, rule T i5 us n s us used in ne 4 and rule 4 is li ed in line 7. Rule 5 cannot be used in line 2 because the o y ne inl li t can be app to is li an the f line 1 ilied ne 1, d ormula in s not a negat foed rmula. Optio 5n : Rule 4 is ed ius n line 2, rule T is us used in ne 4 and rule 5 is li ed in line 7. If rule 4 is app in it w l produce t formula lied line 2, il he □ □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p. To be able to use ¬e 2,4 in thline 5, e formula in 4 wo d have to line ul be ¬ ¬ ¬ p□ □ □ □ . Using rule T in ne 4 canli not produce this. QUESTION 17 What formulas belong in t missing nes of th above proof? he li e 12 Opti 1on : ¬ ¬ □ □ p in li ne 2, p in 4 and □ ¬ □ line □ □ p in line 7 Optio 2n : □ □ □ ¬ ¬ □ p in ne 2, li □ ¬ ¬ □ □ p in line 4 and □ □ p in line 7 Optio 3n : ¬ ¬ □ □ p in line 2, ¬ □ □ ¬ p in line 4 and p in ne 7li Optio 4n : □ □ □ ¬ ¬ □ p in ne 2, ¬ li □ □ ¬ p in line 4 and p in ne 7li Optio 5n : □ □ ¬ p in line 2, ¬ □ ¬ □ p in ne 4 and li □ ¬ □ ¬ □ □ □ p  p in 7line The fact that ¬e 2,4 is used in 5 mea that t foline ns he rmulas in nes 2 and 4 must t complemeli be he nts of hi di one another. T s imme ately eliminates options 3 and I d meanin ess to use th2, 4. t woul be gl e formula in in o since st 8 would redunda (and inc□ ¬ ¬ p p □ □  □ □ line 7, as ption 5, ep be nt orrect). The fo given in option together with the reasons opti 1 of Questi 16, w l give a correcrmulas 1, of on on il t proof. QUESTION 18 What proof s ategy woultr d you use to prove the following sequent: ├ KT4 □ □ (p q)   (□ p  □ q) Opti 1on :  Open a s id box and start wit (p ol h □ □  q) as an assumption.  Use axi T to remove one om □.  Open a dashed box and use □ elimina to g p tion et  q.  Use  elimination twi to obtain the separate atomice c formulas.  Close the dashed box and use introducti tw□ on ice, i.e. on on ea ce ch of t omic forhe at mulas.  Combine □ p and □ q using  introduction.  Close the s id box and use ol  introduction on he t first and last formulas to get t reshe ult. You can confir this is m that a correct proof strategy by writing out the proof, following the instructions step by step. COS 61/237 03/1 13 Optio 2n :  Start with (p □ □  q) as a premise.  Use axi T twice t remove both to g p om o □ et  q.  Use  elimination once to obtain t sephe arate atomic formulas.  Use axi 4 twice, i. once on each atomic formul to om e. a add a . □  Combine □ p and □ q usi roduction. ng  int  Use  introduction on the first and last formulas to g tet he result. Th finae l step of this proof strategy is incorrect, yas ou can o y use side a nl  i out solid box that sta s with trt he ant edeec nt and ends w the ith consequent. Furthermore, when you star with premise, t a then the sequen which yt ou are pr ing should have thaov t formula to t left ohe f the turnstile. Optio 3:n  Start with (p □ □  q) as a premise.  Open a dashed box and use e□ limination to ge (p q). t □   Open another dashed box and use e to g p □ limination et  q.  Use  e minatili on twice to obtain t sep atomic he arate formulas.  Close t first dashed box and use introducti on the □ on he first atomic formul a.  Close the second dashed box and use i□ ntroduction on the seco atomic fo nd rmula.  Combine □ p and □ q usi roduction. ng  int  Use  introduction on the first and last formulas to g tet he result. See comment on Option 2. Option 4:  Open a so d box anli d start with (p q) as an □ □  assumption.  Open a dashed box and use e□ limination to ge (p q). t □   Use axi T to remove one to get p q. om □   Use  e minatili on twice to obtain t sep atomic he arate formulas.  Use axi 4 twice, i. once on each atomic formul to om e. a add a . □  Close the dashed box and combi ne □ p and □ q using  introduction.  Cl liose the so d box and use roduction on the first  int and last formul to g tas et he result. The pro with blem this proof strategy is that it es rule 4 tus o add boxes to and p q. This is not a owed. Rule 4 can oll nly be used to add a box to a formula which alrea st ts dy ar with a box. Optio 5n : This is not a va d seque ili nt n KT4. It is, since there is a co ect rr natural deduction proof for it. See comment on Option 1. 14 QUESTION 19 If we inter et Kpr i  as \"Agent i knows  \", what is t Eng sh translation of t fo ula K ¬ p he li he rm 1 K2  q? Optio 1n : Agent 1 knows that agent 2 doesn't know p imp lies q. This anation presses t formula expl ex he K1 ¬ K2 p q,  which is n t same ot he as t given formulhe a. Optio 2n : Agent 1 knows that agent 2 knows that not p implies q. This expl ex heanation presses t formula K K1 2 (¬ p  q), which is n t same ot he as t given formulhe a. Optio 3n : Agent 1 ows that if age 2 kn nt doesn't know p, then q. This expl ex heanation presses t formula K1 (¬ K p 2  q), which is n t same ot he as t given formulhe a. Optio 4n : Agent 1 ows that if agekn nt 2 knows not p, then q. This anation presses t fo ula expl ex he rm K K q1 (( 2 ¬ p)  ), which is n t same ot he as t given formulhe a. Opti 5on : If agent 1 knows that agent 2 knows not p, then q. This anation expr ses t fo ula expl es he rm (K K p1 2 ¬ )  q, which is t same t given formula due to the he as he precedence of the mod op ators al er over imp cation.li QUESTION 20 If we inter et K \"Agent i knows pr i  as  \", what formula of modal logic is correctly anslated to Eng sh as tr li Agent 1 knows p but he do n't know tha agent 2 knows es t q.
