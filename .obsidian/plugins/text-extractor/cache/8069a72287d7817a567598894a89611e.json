We hope that you will find it interesting and stimulating. You are most welcome to contact your lecturers for any academic queries regarding COS2661. See Sections 3.1 and 3.2 below. This is for academic issues only. (See Section 3.3 for information regarding other kinds of queries.) This tutorial letter contains general information about COS2661 - we discuss the tutorial matter, student support, the syllabus, a recommended study programme, and requirements for examination admission, semester mark and how to set about submitting assignments. In addition, the letter contains Assignments 01, 02 and 03, first for the first semester and then for the second semester, as well as the solution to Assignment 03. Some facts about the three assignments:  The submission of Assignment 01 determines examination admission.  Assignment 02 counts 70% of your semester mark.  Assignment 03 is a self-assessment assignment and should not be submitted. Note, however, that it covers important study material. The model solution is given at the end of this tutorial letter, under addendum. 1 INTRODUCTION The prescribed book (see Section 4.1) is essential study material. You will also need the tutorial letters that you will receive during the course of the semester. Tutorial letter 102 should be available when you register. This letter is your “study guide” and is meant to help you to master the material in the textbook. Some concepts are explained in more detail, examples are given, et cetera. You should use it together with the textbook. Please let us know if you find any errors in Tutorial letter 102. Other tutorial letters will provide additional information (Tutorial Letters 103, 104, etc.) whilst others will discuss the assignments (Tutorial letters 201 and 202). Some of the tutorial matter will not be available when you register. Tutorial matter that is not available when you register will be posted to you as soon as possible. It is not necessary to wait for the printed copies of these letters. The tutorial letters will be available on the Internet. Keep an eye upon myUnisa. One of the requirements for study at the School of Computing is to have regular access to myUnisa. It is therefore expected from you to download any study material from the Internet that, for whatever reason, is not available on paper in time. When you want to use this facility for the first time, you have to register. Go to my.unisa.ac.za and click on “Join myUnisa”. Then follow the instructions on the screen. You will get a password for future use. The tutorial letters will be sent out in English only. 4 COS2661 is a semester module, therefore, time is of the utmost importance. You should start studying the module immediately after registration. This tutorial letter and Tutorial letter 102 (and the textbook) are the most important. 2 PURPOSE AND OUTCOMES 2.1 Purpose The purpose of studying logic is to refine one’s natural ability to reason and argue. Logic is concerned with training the mind to think clearly. The aim of logic is to secure clearness in the definition and arrangement of our ideas and other mental images, consistency in our judgments, and validity in our processes of inference. By studying logic, a student is prepared to:  confront the world with a firm grasp of logical thinking skills,  view logic as a defensive tool, a tool that allows one to defend oneself against the onslaught of powerful persuasive appeals that bombard us daily,  apply logic extensively in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science and Philosophy. 2.2 Outcomes At the end of this study you should:  be imparted with strategies for thinking well,  know about the common errors in reasoning which should be avoided and  have developed effective techniques for evaluating arguments. Abbreviated syllabus: Propositional logic: logic of atomic sentences and the Boolean connectives; informal and formal proofs. Quantifiers: logic of quantifiers; informal and formal proofs. 3 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 3.1 Lecturer(s) The details of your COS2661 lecturer is given below: Lecturer: Dr Bester Chimbo Tel: 011 670 9105 E-mail: chimbb@unisa.ac.za As mentioned in Tutorial letter COSALLF/301/4/2019, students may contact lecturers by mail, e-mail or telephone. We recommend the use of e-mail. COSALLF tutorial letter contains the names and contact details of your COS2661 lecturers. Students may also make appointments to see a lecturer, but this has COS2661/101/3/2019 5 to be done well in advance. Students should mention their student number in all communications with the lecturers. 3.2 Department In the meantime, if you would like to speak to a lecturer, you may contact the secretary of the School of Computing at Tel: (011) 670 9188. Remember to mention your student number. This is for academic queries only. Please do not contact the School about missing tutorial matter, cancellation of a module, payments, enquiries about the registration of assignments, and so on, but rather the relevant department as indicated in the brochure study @ Unisa. 3.3 University The brochure study @ Unisa that you received with your tutorial matter contains information about computer laboratories, the library, myUnisa, assistance with study skills, et cetera. It also contains contact details of several Unisa departments, for example Examinations, Assignments, Despatch, Finances and Student Administration. Remember to mention your student number when contacting the University. 4 RESOURCES 4.1 Prescribed book(s) The prescribed book for this course is: Barwise, J. & J. Etchemendy, 2011. Language, proof and logic. Second Edition, Stanford: ISBN 978-1-57586-632-1, Center for the Study of Language and Information. You have to purchase this book yourself at any of the official booksellers mentioned in the brochure Study @ Unisa. If you have difficulties with obtaining a copy of the book from these bookshops, please contact the Unisa Prescribed Book Section as soon as possible. Together with this book you will receive a CD which contains the computer applications Tarski's world, Fitch, Boole, and Submit, and a manual that explains how to use them. All four of the applications run on Macintosh computers or PC’s equipped with Microsoft Windows 95, 98, or NT 4.0. Three of these applications (Submit, Fitch, and Boole) are written using Java, and so require that your computer have the appropriate Java software installed on it. All the required software, including the necessary Java software, is included on the CD-ROM, though it may require installation. On a Macintosh, you need System 8.1 or higher and MRJ (Macintosh Runtime for Java) 2.1.2 or higher. On a Windows machine, you need Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT 4.0, a Pentium class 6 processor, and JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 1.1.8 or higher. Consult the ReadMe file on the CD- ROM if you have problems getting the applications to run. We shall cover chapters 1 to 14 of the prescribed book in this module. Not all the sections are prescribed, though. Consult Tutorial letter 102 about this. 4.2 Recommended book(s) There are no recommended books for this module. 4.3 Electronic reserves (e-reserves) There are no e-Reserves for this module. 4.4 Library services and resources The Unisa Library offers a range of information services and resources:  for detailed Library information go to http://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/corporate/default/Library  for research support and services (e.g. personal librarians and literature search services) go to http://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/corporate/default/Library/Library-services/Research-support The Library has created numerous Library guides: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za Recommended guides:  Request and download recommended material: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za/request/request  Postgraduate information services: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za/request/postgrad  Finding and using library resources and tools: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za/Research_skills  Frequently asked questions about the Library: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za/ask  Services to students living with disabilities: http://libguides.unisa.ac.za/disability 5 STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES Important information appears in your study @ Unisa brochure. The Student Services Bureau of Unisa provides support for students in general academic matters, such as selecting appropriate modules, developing study skills, adapting to distance education or general difficulties with studies. It is not necessary to make use of a computer in order to pass this module, but it is nevertheless highly recommended that you do so by applying the software supplied with the textbook. (See Section 4.1.) It COS2661/101/3/2019 7 will be very useful for mastering the material. In particular, we strongly recommend that you use the software to do the exercises on Tarski worlds and formal proofs as given in the textbook. Although we, the COS2661 lecturers, do not take active part in the discussion forums on myUnisa, we would like to encourage you to join your fellow students there. You may also organise your own study group. However, we expect every member of a study group to write and submit the assignments on his or her own. Thus, discuss the problem, find solutions, etc., in the group, but then do the assignment yourself and submit your own effort. It is dishonest to submit the work of somebody else as your own. Plagiarism is the act of taking words, ideas and thoughts of others and passing them off as your own. It is a form of theft which involves a number of dishonest academic activities. The Disciplinary Code for Students (2004) is given to all students at registration. You are advised to study the Code, especially Sections 2.1.13 and 2.1.14 (2004:3-4). Kindly read the University’s Policy on Copyright Infringement and Plagiarism as well. 6 STUDY PLAN Use your study @ Unisa brochure for general time management and planning skills. For this module we recommend that you use the study programme given below as a starting point. You will probably need to adapt this schedule, taking into account your other modules and your personal circumstances. You are expected to spend at least 8 hours per week on COS2661. Keep in mind that the skills you will learn in this course are progressive, i.e. you will not be able to understand or do the exercises in the later chapters if you skipped the earlier ones.

COS2661/101/3/2019 9 7 PRACTICAL WORK There are no practicals for this module. 8 ASSESSMENT 8.1 Assessment criteria There are 3 assignments for this module of which Assignments 01 and 02 marks contribute towards the semester mark for COS2661. Assignment 3 is for self-assessment and does not contribute to your year mark. 8.2 Assessment plan The marks that you obtain for Assignments 01 and 02 form the semester mark for COS2661. The semester mark forms 20% and the examination 80% of the final mark for the module. The weights of the COS2661 assignments are indicated in the table below. Assignment Weight 01 30% 02 70% 03 0% An example follows: Suppose a student gets 60% for Assignment 01 and 45% for Assignment 02. In order to calculate the semester mark, the mark obtained for the specific assignment is multiplied by the weight. This then forms part of the 20% that the semester mark contributes to the final mark. Therefore: Assignment Marks obtained Weight Contribution to semester mark 01 60% 30% 60/100 x 30/100 x 20 3.60 02 45% 70% 45/100 x 70/100 x 20 6.30 Total 9.90 In this example the student has a semester mark of 9.90. The semester mark will not form part of the final mark of a supplementary examination. 8.3 Assignment numbers 8.3.1 General assignment numbers Assignments are numbered consecutively per module, starting from 01. 10 8.3.2 Unique assignment numbers Semester 1 Assignment 01 729142 Assignment 02 608235 Semester 2 Assignment 01 632907 Assignment 02 726017 8.4 Assignment due dates Assignment number Due dates of COS2661 assignments Weight for semester mark Semester 1 Semester 2 01 (multiple choice) Compulsory for admission to the examination 22 February 2019 12 August 2019 30% 02 (written assignment) 25 March 2019 13 September 2019 70% 03 (self-assessing) 30 April 2019 15 October 2019 0% 8.5 Submission of assignments To do assignments is extremely important for mastering the study material. We strongly advise you to do all three assignments. The three assignments of both the first and second semesters are given in Section 8.4 of this tutorial letter. The tutorial matter to study for each assignment appears in the study timetables in Section 6 and at the start of each assignment. Give yourself enough time to do the assignments properly, realising that an hour or two will not be sufficient. Follow the procedures in this tutorial letter, in Tutorial letter COSALLF/301/4/2019 and in the brochure study @ Unisa when submitting your assignments.  Assignment 01 is a multiple choice assignment and has to be submitted electronically through myUnisa. There is no extension of the due date for this assignment.  Assignment 02 should be submitted electronically as a .pdf file on myUnisa. The semester system does not allow for late submission of the assignment. COS2661/101/3/2019 11  The work that you have to study during the last weeks of the semester is very important and there will be examination questions set on it. However, because of the constraints of the semester system, Assignment 03 is a self-assessment assignment. Thus you should not submit it. The model solution is given at the end of this tutorial letter. Compare your effort to it. All students will receive a discussion of Assignments 01 and 02 (Tutorial letters 201 and 202). Carefully compare these discussions with your own answers and make sure that you understand any differences. You will receive a percentage mark for Assignments 01 and 02 if you submit them by the respective deadlines. The marks obtained for these two assignments form the semester mark for this module – see Section 8.1. Also note that examination admission is dependent on the submission of Assignment 01 – see Section 9. It is possible that not all questions of Assignment 02 will be marked. Please note that you will obtain 0% if you do not submit the question(s) that is/are marked. The unmarked questions will be considered to be self-assessment questions. In those cases, compare your effort with the model solution. As mentioned above, we discuss all the questions of every assignment in the relevant tutorial letter that you will receive after every due date and that will be available on myUnisa. For detailed information on assignments, please refer to the study @ Unisa brochure, which you received with your study package. To submit an assignment via myUnisa:  Go to myUnisa.  Log in with your student number and password.  Select the module.  Click on assignments in the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.  Click on the assignment number you wish to submit.  Follow the instructions. 12 8.6 The Assignments THE ASSIGNMENTS OF THE FIRST SEMESTER ASSIGNMENT 01 FIRST SEMESTER (MULTIPLE CHOICE) SUBMISSION: On multiple choice form or electronically through myUnisa Please note that Assignment 01 has to be submitted in order to gain examination admission. It will be to your own advantage to check whether the assignment has been registered on the system after a few days. If you want to submit the assignment electronically and myUnisa is off-line during that time, you need not contact us, because we will be aware of it. Simply submit it as soon as myUnisa is available again.

Option 2: Build the truth table for the sentence and inspect the truth values below the main connective. If there are more occurrences of T than F, the sentence is TT-possible. Option 3: Build the truth table for the sentence and inspect the truth values below the main connective. If all these values are T, the sentence is TT-possible. Option 4: Build the truth table for the sentence and inspect the truth values below the main connective. If all these values are F, the sentence is TT-possible. Option 5: None of the above options is a correct way to determine this. The following partially constructed truth table is used in questions 13, 14 and 15. The blocks language is used for all the sentences. LeftOf(a, b) RightOf(a, b) Dodec(a)  Dodec(a) ...... ...... ....... some sentence T T T F T T F T T F T F T F F T F T T F F T F T F F T F F F F T 22 QUESTION 13 Suppose we want to determine if a certain sentence in the blocks language built from the three atomic sentences LeftOf(a, b), RightOf(a, b) and Dodec(a) is a tautological consequence of RightOf(a, b) and  Dodec(a). We build the complete truth table and then inspect the last column. The sentence is a tautological consequence of the two sentences RightOf(a, b) and  Dodec(a) if: Option 1: the entry in lines 3 and 7 is F Option 2: the entry in lines 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 is T Option 3: the entry in line 2 is T Option 4: the entry in lines 2 and 6 is T Option 5: None of the above options will correctly determine this. QUESTION 14 Suppose we want to determine if a certain sentence in the blocks language built from the three atomic sentences LeftOf(a, b), RightOf(a, b) and Dodec(a) is a logical consequence of RightOf(a, b) and  Dodec(a). We build the complete truth table and then inspect the last column. The sentence is a logical consequence of the two sentences RightOf(a, b) and  Dodec(a) if: Option 1: the entry in lines 3 and 7 is F Option 2: the entry in lines 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 is T Option 3: T the entry in line 2 is T Option 4: the entry in lines 2 and 6 is T Option 5: None of the above options will correctly determine this. QUESTION 15 Suppose we want to determine if two sentences in the blocks language, both built from the three atomic sentences LeftOf(a, b), RightOf(a, b) and Dodec(a), are tautologically equivalent. We build the complete truth table where the last two columns indicate the respective truth values of the two sentences. We then inspect the last two columns. The two sentences are tautologically equivalent if Option 1: at least one of the two columns consist of T only Option 2: the last two columns are identical Option 3: the entries in the last two columns are the same in more than four lines Option 4: the entries in the last two columns are T in line 1 Option 5: None of the above options will correctly determine this.

Which of the following options regarding the soundness and validity of the argument is correct? Option 1: The argument is valid and sound. Option 2: The argument is valid but not sound. Option 3: The argument sound but not valid. Option 4: The argument is not valid and not sound. Option 5: It is impossible to give an opinion about the validity and soundness of the argument. QUESTION 17 Consider the following argument: The employees of Xola’s Garage are never at work by 9:00. Xola is employed at Hennie’s Garage. Xola is always at work by 9:00. Which of the following options regarding the soundness and validity of the argument is correct? Option 1: The argument is valid and sound. Option 2: The argument is valid but not sound. Option 3: The argument sound but not valid. Option 4: The argument is not valid and not sound. Option 5: It is impossible to give an opinion about the validity and soundness of the argument. 24 QUESTION 18 Consider the following argument where the blocks language is used:  SameShape(a, b)  SameShape(b, c)  SameShape(a, c) Which of the following options is a proof of the validity or not of the argument? Option 1: The argument is valid because we may choose a to be a cube, b to be a tetrahedron and c to be a dodecahedron, making all three sentences true. Option 2: The argument is valid because it is impossible for the premises to be true. Option 3: The argument is not valid and we prove non-consequence as follows: Suppose a is a cube, b is a tetrahedron and c is a cube. If this is the case, the premises (namely the first two sentences) are true, but the conclusion (namely the third sentence) is not true. Option 4: The argument is not valid because nothing is known about a, b and c. Option 5: It is impossible to decide if the argument is valid or not. QUESTION 19 One or more statements may have been omitted from the formal proof (in the blocks language) below. Which option indicates the complete proof? 1 SameShape(a, b) 2 c = b ... ...

QUESTION 17 Consider the following argument: All piano players are able to play “Rock around the clock”. Thembi is a piano player. Thembi can play “Rock around the clock”. Which of the following options regarding the soundness and validity of the argument is correct? 48 Option 1: The argument is valid and sound. Option 2: The argument is valid but not sound. Option 3: The argument sound but not valid. Option 4: The argument is not valid and not sound. Option 5: It is impossible to give an opinion about the validity and soundness of the argument. QUESTION 18 Consider the following argument where the blocks language is used: Cube(a)  Large(b) Tet(b)  Small(a) Small(a)  Large(b) Which of the following options is a proof of the validity or not of the argument? Option 1: The argument is not valid and we prove non-consequence as follows: Suppose a is a large cube and b is a small tetrahedron. In that case the premises (namely the first two sentences) are true but the conclusion (namely the third sentence) is not true. Option 2: The argument is not valid because a and b should have the same shape and size. Option 3: The argument is valid because it is possible for a to be a small cube and for b to be a large tetrahedron so that all the sentences are true. Option 4: The argument is valid because it is impossible for the premises to be true. Option 5: It is impossible to decide if the argument is valid or not.

Sentence 3: This sentence is false, because in all cases, if a block is a cube then it is small. Sentence 5: This sentence is false, because although the only dodecahedron is large, not all blocks are dodecahedrons. Note: Sentence 9 is true, because it is true that for all blocks there is a block in the same column (even if it is the same block). Sentence 10: This sentence is false, because it is not true that there exists a block that is in the same column as all the other blocks. Sentence 11: This sentence is true because, if the left-hand side of a sentence A  B is false, the sentence is true. In this case Cube(d) is false, therefore the sentence is true regardless whether the right hand side is true or not. 64 QUESTION 3 Question 3.1 Every farmer has either a sister or a cousin. Question 3.2 There is a typist who is Abe’s cousin and Carol’s sister. Question 3.3 If Abe is a typist, all farmers are in the library. Question 3.4 Everybody is either a typist or a farmer and is a cousin of either Beauty or Carol. In order to translate the given FOL sentence correctly, you have to take note of the brackets. Question 3.5 Somebody is no one’s cousin. QUESTION 4 You should note that the material implication symbol () is normally used when dealing with “for all”, x, and that the conjunction symbol () is normally used when dealing with “there exists”, . This also means that you should think very carefully when both  and  are used. Question 4.1 x (Farmer(x)  Cousin(x, abe)) Question 4.2 x y (Sister(y, x)  Typist(y)  Library(y)) Question 4.3 x y (Farmer(x)  Sister(y, x)) Question 4.4 x ((Farmer(x)  Library(x))  y (Cousin(x, y)  Typist(y))) COS2661/101/3/2019 65 Question 4.5 x Cousin(x, carol)  x Cousin(x, beauty)   x Cousin(x, abe) QUESTION 5 Question 5.1 This argument is valid. We show it as follows: Suppose there is not a dodecahedron. Then, according to the first premise, everything is a cube. Then, according to the second premise, everything is large. But the third premise states that there is something that is not large. Thus we have a contradiction. This means that our assumption is not correct. Therefore, we retract our assumption (that there is no dodecahedron) and conclude that there is actually a dodecahedron. Question 5.2 This argument is not valid. In the Tarski world below both premises are true but the conclusion (that there is no small thing) is not true. There actually are small things in the constructed Tarski world. This is what a counterexample is, namely a specific situation (or world) where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. There are many counterexamples – yours could be quite different from ours. back c: D, S left right a: D, S d: C, S b: D, S e: C, S front Tarski world: Question 5.2 66 QUESTION 6 Question 6.1 Many students have difficulty with the application of the  elimination rule. In many cases when the premise starts with x, i.e. when the premise is x , we need to use the  elimination rule. That means that we need to introduce a new name and then assume  with x substituted by the new name. Below this is done in line 4. The  elimination rule is cited in line 11, outside the subproof containing the new name a. The  Intro rule, on the other hand, is cited inside the subproof – see line 10. 1 x (Cube(x)  Large(x)) 2 y ( Large(y)  LeftOf(y, b)) 3 x Cube(x) 4 a Cube(a) 5 Cube(a)  Large(a)  Elim: 1 6 Large(a)  Elim: 4, 5 7 Large(a)  LeftOf(a, b)  Elim: 2 8 LeftOf(a, b)  Elim: 6, 7 9 Large(a)  LeftOf(a, b)  Intro: 6, 8 10 x (Large(x)  LeftOf(x, b))  Intro: 9 11 x (Large(x)  LeftOf(x, b))  Elim: 3, 4 - 10 Question 6.2 This question again involves both quantifiers. Pay special attention to the positions where the rules are cited: both applications of the Elim rule (lines 5 and 6) as well as the application of the  Intro rule (line 13) are inside the subproof starting with the choice of a, while the  Elim rule is cited outside the subproof (line 14).

In such cases we need a subproof starting with the assumption of the formula on the left hand side of the conditional symbol  and ending with the formula on the right hand side of the symbol . The question is made more complicated by the fact that there are actually three  symbols in the goal. The formula on the left hand side of the main connective of the goal is ∀x (P(x)  Q(x)) and that is the reason for its assumption in line 2. This subproof ends in line 9 with the formula on the right hand side of the main connective of the goal, namely ∀x P(x)  ∀x Q(x). Inside this subproof we need a sub-subproof starting with the assumption of ∀x P(x) in line 3 and ending on ∀x Q(x) in line 8. We actually need a sub-sub-subproof (lines 4 to 7) because we need to introduce a new name. You should further note the application of the ∀rules: Both applications of the ∀ Elim rule (lines 5 and 6) are inside the subproof containing the new name b, while the application of the ∀ Intro rule (line 8) is outside this subproof. 68 1 2 ∀x (P(x)  Q(x)) 3 ∀x P(x) 4 b 5 P(b) ∀ Elim 3 6 P(b)  Q(b) ∀ Elim 2 7 Q(b)  Elim 5, 6 8 ∀x Q(x) ∀ Intro 4 - 7 9 ∀x P(x)  ∀x Q(x)  Intro 3 - 8 10 ∀x (P(x)  Q(x))  (∀x P(x)  ∀x Q(x))  Intro 2 - 9 Question 6.4 When you work through this proof, you should keep in mind our comments at questions 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 above regarding the application of the elimination and introduction rules of  and . Also, note how the  elimination rule is applied:  there are two subproofs (lines 7 to 10 and lines 11 to 12),  each starting with one of the disjuncts of the sentence in line 5 (namely Cube(a)  Dodec(a)) and  ending with the same sentence (Dodec(a) in this case) and then  this same sentence (namely Dodec(a)) is deduced by using the  Elim rule outside these subproofs (in line 13).
