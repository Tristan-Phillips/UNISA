Bad designs Elevator controls and labels on the bottom row all look the same, so it is easy to push a label by mistake instead of a control button People do not make same mistake for the labels and buttons on the top row. Why not? www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com Why is this vending machine so bad? • Need to push button first to activate reader • Normally insert bill first before making selection • Contravenes well known convention www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com Good design • Marble answering machine (Bishop, 1995) • Based on how everyday objects behave • Easy, intuitive and a pleasure to use • Only requires one-step actions to perform core tasks www.id-book.com Good and bad design • Why is the TiVo remote much better designed than standard remote controls? • Peanut shaped to fit in hand • Logical layout and color-coded, distinctive buttons • Easy to locate buttons www.id-book.com Dilemma Which is the best way to interact with a smart TV? Why? • Pecking using a grid keyboard via a remote control • Swiping across 2 alphanumeric rows using a touchpad on remote control • Voice control using remote or smart speaker www.id-book.com What to design • Need to take into account: • Who the users are • What activities are being carried out • Where the interaction is taking place • Need to optimize the interactions users have with a product: • So that they match the users’ activities and needs www.id-book.com What is interaction design? “Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.” Sharp, Rogers and Preece (2019) “The design of spaces for human communication and interaction.” Winograd (1997) www.id-book.com Goals of interaction design • Develop usable products • Usability means easy to learn, effective to use and provide an enjoyable experience • Involve users in the design process www.id-book.com Which kind of design? • Number of other terms used emphasizing what is being designed, e.g. • user interface design, software design, user-centered design, product design, web design, experience design (UX) • Interaction design is the umbrella term covering all of these aspects • fundamental to all disciplines, fields, and approaches concerned with researching and designing computer- based systems for people www.id-book.com Interaction design www.id-book.com 12 Relationship between ID, HCI and other fields Academic disciplines contributing to ID: • Psychology • Social Sciences • Computing Sciences • Engineering • Ergonomics • Informatics www.id-book.com Relationship between ID, HCI and other fields Design practices contributing to ID: • Graphic design • Product design • Artist-design • Industrial design • Film industry www.id-book.com Relationship between ID, HCI and other fields Interdisciplinary fields that ‘do’ interaction design: • HCI • Ubiquitous Computing • Human Factors • Cognitive Engineering • Cognitive Ergonomics • Computer Supported Co-operative Work • Information Systems www.id-book.com Working in multidisciplinary teams • Many people from different backgrounds involved • Different perspectives and ways of seeing and talking about things • Benefits • more ideas and designs generated • Disadvantages • difficult to communicate and progress forward the designs being create www.id-book.com 16 Interaction design in business • Large number of ID consultancies, examples of well known ones include: • Nielsen Norman Group: “help companies enter the age of the consumer, designing human-centered products and services” • Cooper: “From research and product to goal-related design” • IDEO: “creates products, services and environments for companies pioneering new ways to provide value to their customers” www.id-book.com The User Experience • How a product behaves and is used by people in the real world • the way people feel about it and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, holding it, and opening or closing it • “every product that is used by someone has a user experience: newspapers, ketchup bottles, reclining armchairs, cardigan sweaters.” (Garrett, 2010) • “all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products. (Nielsen and Norman, 2014) • Cannot design a user experience, only design for a user experience www.id-book.com Defining User Experience • how users perceive a product, such as whether a smartwatch is seen as sleek or chunky, and their emotional reaction to it, such as whether people have a positive experience when using it. (Hornbæk and Hertzum, 2017) • Hassenzahl’s (2010) model of the user experience • pragmatic - how simple, practical, and obvious it is for the user to achieve their goals • hedonic - how evocative and stimulating the interaction is to users www.id-book.com Why was the iPod user experience such a success? • Quality user experience from the start • Simple, elegant, distinct brand, pleasurable, must have fashion item, catchy names, cool, etc. www.id-book.com Core characteristics of interaction design • Users should be involved through the development of the project • Specific usability and user experience goals need to be identified, clearly documented and agreed at the beginning of the project • Iteration is needed through the core activities www.id-book.com Why? • Help designers: • understand how to design interactive products that fit with what people want, need and may desire • appreciate that one size does not fit all e.g., teenagers are very different to grown-ups • identify any incorrect assumptions they may have about particular user groups e.g., not all old people want or need big fonts • be aware of both people’s sensitivities and their capabilities www.id-book.com Accessibility and Inclusiveness • Accessibility – the extent to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible • focus is on people with disabilities, e.g. Android OS, Apple VoiceOver • Inclusiveness –making products and services accommodate the widest possible number of people • e.g. smartphones designed for all and made available to everyone regardless of their disability, education, age, or income www.id-book.com Disabilities • Whether someone is disabled changes over time with age, or recovery from an accident • The severity and impact of an impairment can vary over the course of a day or in different environmental conditions • Disabilities can result because technologies are designed to necessitate a certain type of interaction that is impossible for someone with an impairment www.id-book.com Understanding Disability • Disabilities can be classified as: • Sensory impairment (such as loss of vision or hearing) • Physical impairment (having loss of functions to one or more parts of the body after a stroke or spinal cord injury) • Cognitive (e.g. learning impairment or loss of memory/cognitive function due to old age) • Each type can be further defined in terms of capability • e.g. someone might have only peripheral vision, be color blind, or have no light perception • Impairment can be categorized: • permanent (e.g., long-term wheelchair user) • temporary (e.g. after an accident or illness) • situational (e.g. a noisy environment means a person can’t hear) www.id-book.com Being Cool About Disability • Prosthetics can be designed to move beyond being functional (and often ugly) to being desirable and fashionable • People now refer to “wearing their wheels,” rather than “using a wheelchair” www.id-book.com Fashionable leg cover designed by Alleles Design Studio Cultural Differences • 5/21/2015 versus 21/5/2015? • Which should be used for international services and online forms? • Why is it that certain products, like smartphones, universally accepted by people from all parts of the world whereas websites are reacted to differently by people from different cultures? www.id-book.com Usability Goals • Effective to use • Efficient to use • Safe to use • Have good utility • Easy to learn • Easy to remember how to use www.id-book.com User Experience Goals Desirable aspects Satisfying Helpful Fun Enjoyable Motivating Provocative Engaging Challenging Surprising Pleasurable Enhancing sociability Rewarding Exciting Supporting creativity Emotionally fulfilling Entertaining Cognitively stimulating Experiencing flow Undesirable aspects Boring Unpleasant Frustrating Patronizing Making one feel guilty Making one feel stupid Annoying Cutesy Childish Gimmicky www.id-book.com Usability and User experience goals • Selecting terms to convey a person’s feelings, emotions, etc., can help designers understand the multifaceted nature of the user experience • How do usability goals differ from user experience goals? • Are there trade-offs between the two kinds of goals? • e.g. can a product be both fun and safe? • How easy is it to measure usability versus user experience goals? www.id-book.com Design Principles • Generalizable abstractions for thinking about different aspects of design • The do’s and don'ts of interaction design • What to provide and what not to provide at the interface • Derived from a mix of theory-based knowledge, experience and common-sense www.id-book.com Visibility • This is a control panel for an elevator • How does it work? • Push a button for the floor you want? • Nothing happens. Push any other button? Still nothing. What do you need to do? • It is not visible as to what to do! www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com Visibility …you need to insert your room card in the slot by the buttons to get the elevator to work! How would you make this action more visible? • make the card reader more obvious • provide an auditory message, that says what to do (which language?) • provide a big label next to the card reader that flashes when someone enters • make relevant parts visible • make what has to be done obvious www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com What do I do if I am wearing black? Invisible automatic controls can make it more difficult to use www.id-book.com Feedback • Sending information back to the user about what has been done • Includes sound, highlighting, animation and combinations of these • e.g. when screen button clicked on provides sound or red highlight feedback: www.id-book.com “ccclichhk” Constraints • Restricting the possible actions that can be performed • Helps prevent user from selecting incorrect options • Physical objects can be designed to constrain things • e.g. only one way you can insert a key into a lock www.id-book.com Logical or ambiguous design? • Where do you plug the mouse? • Where do you plug the keyboard? • top or bottom connector? • Do the color coded icons help? www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com How to design them more logically (i) A provides direct adjacent mapping between icon and connector (ii) B provides color coding to associate the connectors with the labels www.id-book.com www.baddesigns.com www.baddesigns.com Consistency • Design interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for similar tasks • For example: • always use ctrl key plus first initial of the command for an operation – ctrl+C, ctrl+S, ctrl+O • Main benefit is consistent interfaces are easier to learn and use www.id-book.com 39 When consistency breaks down • What happens if there is more than one command starting with the same letter? • e.g. save, spelling, select, style • Have to find other initials or combinations of keys, thereby breaking the consistency rule • e.g. ctrl+S, ctrl+Sp, ctrl+shift+L • Increases learning burden on user, making them more prone to errors www.id-book.com Internal and external consistency • Internal consistency refers to designing operations to behave the same within an application • Difficult to achieve with complex interfaces • External consistency refers to designing operations, interfaces, etc., to be the same across applications and devices • Very rarely the case, based on different designer’s preference www.id-book.com 41 Keypad numbers layout A case of external inconsistency www.id-book.com 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 (a) phones, remote controls (b) calculators, computer keypads Affordances: to give a clue • Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it • e.g. a mouse button invites pushing, a door handle affords pulling • Norman (1988) used the term to discuss the design of everyday objects • Since has been much popularised in interaction design to discuss how to design interface objects • e.g. scrollbars to afford moving up and down, icons to afford clicking on www.id-book.com What does ‘affordance’ have to offer interaction design? • Interfaces are virtual and do not have affordances like physical objects • Norman argues it does not make sense to talk about interfaces in terms of ‘real’ affordances • Instead interfaces are better conceptualized as ‘perceived’ affordances • learned conventions of arbitrary mappings between action and effect at the interface • some mappings are better than others www.id-book.com 44 Activity Virtual affordances • How do the following screen objects afford? • What if you were a novice user? • Would you know what to do with them? www.id-book.com Key points • Interaction design is concerned with designing interactive products to support how people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives • It is concerned with how to create quality user experiences for services, devices and interactive products • It is multidisciplinary, involving many inputs from wide-reaching disciplines and fields • Optimizing the interaction between users and interactive products requires consideration of a number of interdependent factors, including context of use, types of activity, UX goals, accessibility, cultural differences, and user groups. • Design principles, such as feedback and simplicity, are useful heuristics for informing, analyzing, and evaluating aspects of an interactive product. www.id-book.com","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
