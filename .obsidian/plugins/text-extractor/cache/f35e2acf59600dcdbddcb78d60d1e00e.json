Number both the page numbers as well as the memory addresses starting from zero (1e 0). 31 52 Use your table 1n 5 1 and calculate the reduced page reference strng, given a page size of 50 words Show full workings. 2] 53 Calculate the page fauit rate for the reduced reference string in 5 2 for the optimal replacement algorithm.
