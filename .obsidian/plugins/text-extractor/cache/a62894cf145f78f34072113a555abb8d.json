Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Rationality: omniscience, learning, and autonomy • An omniscient (perfect) agent knows the actual outcome of its actions and can act accordingly; but perfection is impossible in reality. • Rationality is NOT the same as perfection. • Rationality maximizes expected performance, while perfection maximizes actual performance. • A rational agent not only to gather information (exploration) but also to learn as much as possible from what it perceives. • An agent relies on the prior knowledge of its designer rather than on its own percepts, we say that the agent lacks autonomy. A rational agent should be autonomous. • Rational  exploration, learning, autonomy Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year? Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Task Environment: PEAS • To design a rational agent, we must specify the task environment. • The performance measure, the environment, and the agent’s actuators and sensors are grouped as the task environment, and called as PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors).

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Environment types • The environment type largely determines the agent design. • Fully observable vs. partially observable: • If an agent’s sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time, then task environment is called as fully observable. • Fully observable environments are convenient because the agent need not maintain any internal state to keep track of the world. • An environment might be partially observable because of noisy and inaccurate sensors. • Single agent vs. multi agent: • One or more agents. Solving a crossword puzzle is a single agent environment. • Chess is a competitive multi agent environment because an agent tries to maximize its performance while minimizing the performance of other agent. • Taxi-driving partially cooperative multi agent environment because avoiding collisions maximizes all agents’ performances. Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year? Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Environment types • Deterministic vs. stochastic: • If the next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agent, then the environment is deterministic; otherwise, it is stochastic. • Episodic vs. sequential: • In an episodic task environment, the agent’s experience is divided into atomic episodes. In each episode the agent receives a percept and then performs a single action. The next episode does not depend on the actions taken in previous episodes. • In sequential environments, on the other hand, the current decision could affect all future decisions. Chess and taxi driving are sequential: in both cases, short-term actions can have long- term consequences. • Static vs. dynamic: • If the environment can change while an agent is deliberating, then we say the environment is dynamic for that agent; otherwise, it is static. • Discrete vs. continuous: • The discrete/continuous distinction applies to the state of the environment. • Chess is discrete; Taxi-driving continuous Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Downloaded by: stuvia7feva | stuvia.7feva@simplelogin.com Distribution of this document is illegal Want to earn R13,625 per year?

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Problem-Solving Agent • A problem-solving agent is a goal-based agent and use atomic representations. • In atomic representations, states of the world are considered as wholes, with no internal structure visible to the problem solving algorithms. • Intelligent agents are supposed to maximize their performance measure. Achieving this is sometimes simplified if the agent can adopt a goal and aim at satisfying it. • Problem formulation is the process of deciding what actions and states to consider, given a goal. • The process of looking for a sequence of actions that reaches the goal is called search. • A search algorithm takes a problem as input and returns a solution in the form of an action sequence. • Once a solution is found, the carrying actions it recommends is called the execution phase. • A problem-solving agent has three phases: • problem formulation, searching solution and executing actions in the solution.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Problem-Solving Agent Well-defined problems A problem can be defined by five components: • initial state, actions, transition model, goal test, path cost. INITIAL STATE: The initial state that the agent starts in. ACTIONS: A description of the possible actions available to the agent. • Given a particular state s, ACTIONS(s) returns the set of actions that can be executed in s. • Each of these actions is applicable in s. TRANSITION MODEL: A description of what each action does is known as the transition model • A function RESULT(s,a) that returns the state that results from doing action a in state s. • The term successor to refer to any state reachable from a given state by a single • The state space of the problem is the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions. • The state space forms a graph in which the nodes are states and the links between nodes are actions. • A path in the state space is a sequence of states connected by a sequence of actions.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Problem-Solving Agent Well-defined problems GOAL TEST: The goal test determines whether a given state is a goal state. PATH COST: A path cost function that assigns a numeric cost to each path. • The problem-solving agent chooses a cost function that reflects its own performance measure. • The cost of a path can be described as the sum of the costs of the individual actions along the path. • The step cost of taking action a in state s to reach state s′ is denoted by c(s, a, s′). • A SOLUTION to a problem is an action sequence that leads from the initial state to a goal state. • Solution quality is measured by the path cost function, and an OPTIMAL SOLUTION has the lowest path cost among all solutions.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Problem Example vacuum world States: • The state is determined by both the agent location and the dirt locations. • The agent is in one of two locations, each of which might or might not contain dirt. • Thus, there are 2 × 22 = 8 possible world states. Initial state: Any state can be designated as the initial state. Actions: Each state has just three actions: Left, Right, and Suck. Transition model: • The actions have their expected effects, except that moving Left in the leftmost square, moving Right in the rightmost square, and Sucking in a clean square have no effect. • The transition model defines a state space. Goal test: This checks whether all the squares are clean. Path cost: Each step costs 1, so the path cost is the number of steps in the path.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Measuring Problem-Solving Performance • We can evaluate a search algorithm’s performance in four ways: Completeness: Is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one? Optimality: Does the strategy find the optimal solution? Time complexity: How long does it take to find a solution? Space complexity: How much memory is needed to perform the search?

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Measuring Problem-Solving Performance • The typical measure for time and space complexity is the size of the state space graph, |V | + |E|, where V is the set of vertices (nodes) of the graph and E is the set of edges (links). • This is appropriate when the graph is an explicit data structure. • In AI, graph is often represented implicitly by the initial state, actions, and transition model and is frequently infinite. For these reasons, complexity is expressed in terms of three quantities: • b - maximum branching factor of the search tree • d - depth of the least-cost solution • m - maximum depth of the state space (may be ∞) • Time is often measured in terms of the number of nodes generated during the search, and space in terms of the maximum number of nodes stored in memory.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Conditions for Optimality: Admissibility and Consistency • The first condition for optimality is that heuristic function h(n) must be an admissible heuristic. • An admissible heuristic is one that never overestimates the cost to reach the goal (optimistic). • A heuristic h(n) is admissible if for every node n, h(n)≤ C(n) where C(n) is the true cost to reach the goal state from the state of node n. • Straight-line distance heuristic hSLD(n) is admissible because the shortest path between any two points is a straight line. hSLD(n) never overestimates actual distance. • If h(n) is admissible, f(n) never overestimates the cost to reach the goal because f(n)=g(n)+h(n) and g(n) is the actual cost to reach node n. • A heuristic h(n) is consistent if, for every node n and every successor n′ of n generated by any action a, the estimated cost of reaching the goal from n is no greater than the step cost of getting to n′ plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from n′: h(n) ≤ c(n, a, n′) + h(n′) • hSLD(n) is consistent. • If h(n) is admissible and consistent, then A* is complete and optimal.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Optimality of A* (proof) • If h(n) is consistent (h(n) ≤ c(n, a, n′) + h(n′)), then the values of f(n) along any path are non-decreasing. • The proof follows directly from the definition of consistency. • Suppose n′ is a successor of n; then g(n′)=g(n) + c(n, a, n′) for some action a, and we have f(n′) = g(n′) + h(n′) = g(n) + c(n, a, n′) + h(n′) ≥ g(n) + h(n) = f(n) . • Whenever A∗ selects a node n for expansion, the optimal path to that node has been found. • If this is not the case, there would have to be another frontier node n′ on the optimal path from the start node to n, because f is non-decreasing along any path, n′ would have lower f-cost than n and would have been selected first. • From these two preceding observations, it follows that the sequence of nodes expanded by A∗ is in non-decreasing order of f(n). • Hence, the first goal node selected for expansion must be an optimal solution because f is the true cost for goal nodes (h(Goal)=0) and all later goal nodes will be at least as expensive.

They use very little memory (usually a constant amount), and 2. They can often find reasonable solutions in large or infinite (continuous) state spaces. • In addition to finding goals, local search algorithms are useful for solving pure optimization problems, in which the aim is to find the best state according to an objective function. • In optimization problems, the path to goal is irrelevant and the goal state itself is the solution. • In some optimization problems, the goal is not known and the aim is to find the best state.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Why formulate a problem as a CSP? • CSPs yield a natural representation for a wide variety of problems. • If we already have a CSP-solving system, it is often easier to solve a problem using it than to design a custom solution using another search technique. • CSP solvers can be faster than state-space searchers because the CSP solver can quickly eliminate large portions of the search space. • For example, once we have chosen {SA=blue} in the Australia problem, we can conclude that none of the five neighboring variables can take on the value blue. • Without taking advantage of constraint propagation, a search procedure would have to consider 35 =243 assignments for the five neighboring variables; • With constraint propagation we never have to consider blue as a value, so we have only 25 =32 assignments to look at, a reduction of 87%. • With CSPs, once we find out that a partial assignment is not a solution, we can immediately discard further refinements of the partial assignment. • Many problems that are intractable for regular state-space search can be solved quickly when formulated as a CSP.

Stuvia.com - The study-notes marketplace Searching for Proofs • Searching for proofs is an alternative to enumerating models (exponential) and it is more efficient. • We can apply any of the search algorithms to find a sequence of steps that constitutes a proof. We just need to define a proof problem as follows: INITIAL STATE: The initial knowledge base. ACTIONS: The set of actions consists of all the inference rules applied to all the sentences that match the top half of the inference rule. RESULT: The result of an action is to add the sentence in the bottom half of the inference rule. GOAL: The goal is a state that contains the sentence we are trying to prove.

Every definite clause can be written as an implication whose premise is a conjunction of positive literals and whose conclusion is a single positive literal. • In Horn form, the premise is called the body and the conclusion is called the head. • A sentence consisting of a single positive literal is called a fact. 2. Inference with Horn clauses can be done through the forward chaining and backward chaining algorithms. This type of inference is the basis for logic programming. 3.
