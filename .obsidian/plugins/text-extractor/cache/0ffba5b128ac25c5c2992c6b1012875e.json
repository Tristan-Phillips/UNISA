Each variable has the domain {0, .., 9}. We have the following constraints: S + S = R + 10C1 (1) S + D + C1 = E + 10C2 (2) O + A + C2 = G + 10C3 (3) R + O + C3 = N + 10C4 (4) C + R + C4 = A + 10C5 (5) D = C5 (6) C ̸= 0 (7) R ̸= 0 (8) D ̸= 0 (9) Alldif f (C, R, O, S, A, N, D, G, E) (10) where C1, .., C5 are the carry digits with domain {0, 1}. Constraints (6) and (9): C5 = D = 1 . Constraint (1): We observe that R has to be even and S ̸= 0. Moreover since S ̸= 1 and R ̸= 0, the domain of R is DR = {4, 6, 8}. Thus the domain of S is DS = {2, 3, 4}. Therefore C1 = 0 . Constraint (2): Since 2 ≤ S ≤ 4, we have 3 ≤ S + 1 ≤ 5. Thus C2 = 0 and DE = {3, 4, 5}. Constraint (3): O + A = G + 10C3. Assume O = 0, so A = G + 10C3. This is impossible whether C3 = 0 or C3 = 1 because A ̸= G and A ≤ 9. Thus O ̸= 0. Using a similar reasoning, we get A ̸= 0. At this stage, we have the following possible values for S, R and E: 1. S = 2, R = 4, E = 3, or 2. S = 3, R = 6, E = 4, or 3. S = 4, R = 8, E = 5. Let us explore these possibilities: 1 1. Assumption: S = 2, R = 4, E = 3. From constraint (5), we get: C + 4 + C4 = A + 10 =⇒ C + C4 = A + 6. We have A ≥ 5, thus C + C4 ≥ 11 which is impossible. Therefore S ̸= 2, R ̸= 4, E ̸= 3 and we backtrack to the previous step. 2. Assumption: S = 3, R = 6, E = 4. From constraint (5), we get: C + 6 + C4 = A + 10 =⇒ C + C4 = A + 4. We have A ≥ 2 =⇒ A + 4 ≥ 6. We also have C ≤ 9 =⇒ C + C4 ≤ 10. Thus A + 4 ≤ 10 =⇒ A ≤ 6. Thus DA = {2, 5}. 2.1. Assumption: A = 2. From constraint (5), we get: C + C4 = 6. Thus C = 5 and C4 = 1. From constraint (3), we get: O+2 = G+10C3. We know at this stage that DO = {7, 8, 9}. • If C3 = 0, then O = 7, G = 9. From constraint (4), we get: 6 + 7 = N + 10. Impossible because N ̸= 3. • If C3 = 1, then O = 8, G = 0. From constraint (4), we get: 6 + 8 + 1 = N + 10. Impossible because N ̸= 5. Therefore our assumption about A cannot be true and we conclude that A = 5. 2.2. Assumption: A = 5. From constraint (3), we get: O + 5 = G + 10C3. At this stage, DO = {2, 7, 8, 9} and DG = {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}. • If C3 = 0, then O + 5 = G, thus O = 2 and G = 7. From constraint (4), we get: 6 + 2 = N + 10C4. Thus N = 8 and C4 = 0. From constraint (5), we get: C + 6 = 15 =⇒ C = 9. We have found an assignment to all variables at this stage. Since there is a unique solution to the puzzle, we do not need to explore further. The solution to the puzzle is as follows: D = 1, O = 2, S = 3, E = 4, A = 5, R = 6, G = 7, N = 8, C = 9 with C1 = C2 = C3 = C4 = 0 and C5 = 1. We can verify that: 96233 + 62513 = 158746. 2","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
