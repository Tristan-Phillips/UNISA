[1] 5. What is CARD as a participatory design method? [1] Long questions (5) 1. Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) argue that users should be involved in the interaction design beyond just eliciting user or system requirements. Why do you think this is important? [20] 2. Identify and explain the four activities involved in the process of interaction Design. [20] 3. Outline and explain the three principles pioneered by Gould and Lewis (1985) regarding user- centered approach to system design. [20] 4. What is ethnography and why is it relevant to design of products and systems? [20] 5. Explain the concept of Contextual Inquiry and outline its constituent principles. [20] Answers short questions (5) 1. [pages 326] Organizational memory refers to the collective ability by an organization or a company to accumulate, store, and retrieve knowledge and data. Human memory is all about our ability to gain, store, and retrieve data Organizational memory has two principal repositories: the archives of the organization, and individual people’s memories. With the term archives, we also include the organization’s electronic databases. 2. [pages ] An artifact model shows how tangible elements (physical or electronic) are used and structured in the business process flow of doing the work. Work artifacts are one of the most important entities that get passed from one work role to another within the flow model. Examples include paper memos, email messages, correspondence templates, product change orders, and other things people create and use while working. 3. [pages 338] PICTIVE stands for Plastic interface for collaborative technology initiatives through video exploration. It is a paper mock-up technique that permits users to take part in the development process. A PICTIVE is an illustration of a Web page or a graphical user interface (GUI) on paper. The PICTIVE prototype helps users get an idea of how a system will look and act when it is finished. In PICTIVE, non-technical persons get the opportunity to contribute their ideas to the development process. 4. [pages 326] Contextual Design is a customer-centered design method that uses extensive field data as the foundation for understanding users’ needs, tasks, intents, and processes in order to design products and systems that meet both users’ and business’ needs. 5. [pages 340-341] CARD is an acronym for Collaborative Analysis of Requirements and Design. It is a design method where users are actively involved in the design process. Similar to PICTIVE it explores work flow not detailed screen design at a much higher level of abstraction. It uses playing cards with pictures of computers and screen dumps. Answers long questions (5) 1. [pages 311-313] Indeed as argued by Peerce, Rogers and Sharpe (2015) , users should be involved in the interaction design process not just for eliciting user or system requirements. This is for two important reasons: Expectation management is the first reason is user involvement in design process. This consists in making sure that the users7 views and expectations of the new product or system are met without unpleasant surprises. It is better to exceed users' expectations than to fall below them. Therefore involving users throughout the development process helps with expectation management because they can see from an early stage what The system or product's capabilities are and what they are not. They will also understand better how it will affect their jobs and what 'they can expect to do with the product; they are less likely to be disappointed. Users can also see the capabilities develop and understand, at least to some extent, why the features are the way they are. Ownership is the second reason for user involvement. Users who are implicated and feel that they have contributed to a product's development, are more likely to feel a sense of \"ownership\" towards it and to be receptive to it when it finally emerges. 2. [pages ] The four activities involved in Interaction Design include: - First, identifying users’ needs and establishing system requirements - Second, Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements - Third, Building interactive versions of the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed - Four, Evaluating what is being built throughout the process 3. [pages 316-317] - Early Focus on Users and Tasks First: designers must understand who the users will be. This understanding is arrived at in part by directly studying their cognitive, behavioral, anthropometric, and attitudinal characteristics, and in part by studying the nature of the work expected to be accomplished. - Empirical Measurement Second: early in the development process, intended users should actually use simulations and prototypes to carry out real work, and their performance and reactions should be observed, recorded, and analyzed. - Iterative Design Third: when problems are found in user testing, as they will be, they must be fixed. This means design must be iterative: There must be a cycle of design, test and measure, and redesign, repeated as often as necessary. 4. [pages 319-322] Ethnography can be viewed as a scientific discipline concerned with studying and describing a culture, customs, beliefs, and behavior of a people based on information collected through fieldwork. As such ethnography is amply relevant in interaction design for several reasons amongst others: Ethnography is relevant to design for several reasons: 1. To gain insight on the user's environment First, since designers often create artifacts for work settings they know little about, some understanding of those settings is needed so that the technologies suit the situations of their use. 2. To eliminate the designers’ worldview Second, because technologies help shape the work practices of their users, it is important that the designers' worldview not be imposed inappropriately on users. If designers have little information regarding the situations in which technologies are used, the best they can do is rely on their own experiences and imagination thus running the risk of designing technologies better suited to their needs than those of the actual users. 3. To optimize technologies even when there is uncertainty regarding use Third, there are situations where designers create technologies whose possible uses are unknown. Such situations might be described as technology in search of an application. Some understanding of the work in which potential users are engaged can help identify possible uses and refine the original technology design. 4. To better understand the context of use 8 Fourth, in understanding that the utilization of technology is inextricably linked to the conditions of the user’s environment, technology that is tested in a more traditional [human machine dyad] may fail to capture important nuances. 5. To create (provide) a fuller (thorough; more comprehensive) picture (vision; visualization; representation) of the technology for the user. Fifth, when designing radically new technologies, users often are unable to give meaningful responses to queries about how they might use such technologies. They need to be provided with a way of envisioning and experiencing the technology in the context of their own work practices before they can contribute to such a discussion. To create the context for such a discussion and to be useful partners in the joint exploration of the relation between work and technology, designers must have some understanding of the user's work. 6. To shift design from single task focus in order to account for a more holistic understanding of outside influences on the users. Finally, the singletask focus of some technology design efforts is ill-suited to design of technologies that support task integration. Simply focusing on a single task or the tasks of the single user ignores how the work of one individual articulates with that of many others. For example, a print shop operator's work may rely on the work of document creators, word processing specialists, graphic artists, sales representatives and many others. Systems that support the print shop operator's work should be designed with some larger understanding of how the work of these others impinges upon the work of the print shop operator. Great designs don't just appear overnight – they take time to get right. UX designers and, in fact, all other kinds of designer know that they don't get one try to make a product the best it can be, it takes many iterations to get the product the way that it best suits the user. Iterative design processes are used across all design disciplines to produce results that count. A UX designer should ensure that they understand how iteration works and how to best use it in their own work. 5. [pages] [pages] Contextual Inquiry is an approach to ethnographic study where user is expert, designer is apprentice. It is a form of interview, but at users’ workplace The four main principles of a contextual inquiry are: — Context: see workplace & what happens — Partnership: user and developer collaborate — Interpretation: observations interpreted by user and developer together — Focus: project focus to help understand what to look for","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
