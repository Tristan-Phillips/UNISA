It has been granted. We do not know on which date it is going to take place yet, but I'm informing you so that you can start preparing should you decide to make use of the opportunity. We have been told that the system is now more stable. Any student may do the re-take exam, but it is not compulsory. It was granted because so many students could not even get into myExams. The best of the two marks will be taken. The exam will have the same format. Please note that it is not a supplementary exam, and therefore the marks for the first exam will not be made available. At this point | do not have any further details. | will send out an announcement as soon as a date has been decided on. So please start preparing if you want to make use of the opportunity. As with the first exam, there will be no IRIS invigilation for the module. Please check your announcements regularly for further communication. â‚¬ v Reply","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
