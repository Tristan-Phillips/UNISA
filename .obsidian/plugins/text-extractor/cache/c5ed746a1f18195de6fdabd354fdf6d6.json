What is interaction design? ● Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives. The process of Interaction Design involves four basic activities: 1) Establishing requirements. 2) Designing alternatives. 3) Prototyping. 4) Evaluating. Accessibility: ● Refers to the degree to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible. A focus is on people with disabilities. Usability Goals: ● Effectiveness (How good a product is at doing what it’s supposed to). ● Efficiency (The way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks). ● Safety (Protecting users from dangerous conditions). ● Utility (Extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality). ● Learnability (How easy a system is to learn to use). ● Memorability (How easy a product is to remember how to use). User experience goals: ● What the interaction with the system feels like to the users (subjectively). ● User experience goals differ from the more objective usability goals in that they are concerned with how users experience an interactive product from their own perspective, rather than assessing how useful or productive a system is from its own perspective. Desirable aspects: ● Satisfying ● Enjoyable ● Engaging ● Pleasurable ● Exciting ● Entertaining ● Helpful ● Motivating ● Challenging ● Enhancing sociability ● Supporting creativity ● Cognitively stimulating ● Fun ● Provocative ● Surprising ● Rewarding ● Emotionally fulfilling Undesirable aspects: ● Boring ● Frustrating ● Making one feel guilty ● Annoying ● Childish ● Unpleasant ● Patronizing ● Making one feel stupid ● Cutesy ● Gimmicky Design principles: ● Are used by interaction designers to aid their thinking when designing for the user experience. Norman’s Design Principles: ● Visibility ● Feedback ● Constraints ● Consistency ● Affordance Nielsen’s 10 Usability Principles: 1) Visibility of system status 2) Match between system and real world 3) User control and freedom 4) Consistency and standards 5) Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors 6) Error prevention 7) Recognition rather than recall 8) Flexibility and efficiency of use 9) Aesthetic and minimalist design 10) Help and documentation. Chapter 2 – Understanding and conceptualizing interaction: Benefits or conceptualizing the design space early on: ● Orientation (enabling the design team to ask specific questions regarding how the conceptual model will be understood by users). ● Open-mindedness (Preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focused early on). ● Common ground (Allowing design team to establish as set of common terms that all can understand and agree on). Conceptual model: ● A conceptual model provides a working strategy and a framework of general concepts and their interrelations. Core components of a conceptual model: ● Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for, and how to use it for an activity. ● The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them. ● The relationships between those concepts. ● The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke. Interface metaphors: ● Considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. They provide a structure that is similar is some ways to aspects of a familiar entity/s, but also have their own behaviors and properties. The four main interaction types: ● Instructing (users issue instructions to the system). ● Conversing (users have a dialogue with the system). ● Manipulating (users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space). ● Exploring (users move through a virtual environment or a physical space). Paradigm: ● Refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values and practices. Theory: ● A Theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspects of a phenomenon. Model: ● Is a simplification of some aspect of human-computer interaction intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. Framework: ● Is a set of inter-related concepts and/or a set of specific questions that is intended to inform a particular domain area, on-line communities, or an analytic method. Chapter 5 – Emotional Interaction: Interfaces can be frustrating: ● When an application doesn’t work properly or crashes ● When a system doesn’t do what the user wants it to do ● When a user’s expectations are not met ● When a system does not provide sufficient information to let the user know what to do ● When error messages are vague or unhelpful ● When the appearance of the interface is too noisy, garish, gimmicky or patronizing ● When a system requires users to carry out too many steps to perform a task, only to discover a mistake was made somewhere along the line and they need to start all over again. People are often annoyed by: ● Websites that are overloaded by text and graphics. ● Flashing animations, popups, banner ads. ● Over-use of sound effects and music. ● Featuritis. ● Childish designs. ● Poorly laid out keyboards, pads, control panels. Persuasive technology: ● Interactive computing systems that are deliberately designed to change peoples’ attitudes and behaviors. e.g. popup ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts etc. Anthropomorphism: ● Attributing human qualities to animals and objects. Zoomorphism: ● Shaping of an object or design in animal form. Ortony et als’ model of emotion and behavior is couched in terms of different levels of the brain: ● Visceral level (Lowest level - Parts of the brain are pre-wired to automatically respond to events happening in the physical world. Responds rapidly, making judgements about what is good or bad, safe or dangerous, pleasurable or abhorrent. It also triggers the emotional responses to stimuli (e.g. fear, joy, anger, and sadness) that are expressed through a combination of physiological and behavioral responses). ● Behavioral level (The brain processes that control our everyday behavior, where most human activities occur, e.g. talking, typing, and driving). ● Reflective level (Highest level - Brain processes that contemplate - entails conscious thought where people generalize across events, or step back from the routine and immediate). Four distinct types of pleasure (Jordan): ● Physio-pleasure (Bodily pleasures) ● Socio-pleasure (Enjoying being in the company of others) ● Psycho-pleasure (Emotional and cognitive reactions to a product) ● Ideo-pleasure (Cognitive, refers to peoples’ values) Four core threads that make up our holistic experiences: ● Sensual thread (Sensory engagement with a situation) ● Emotional thread (Emotions intertwined with the situation) ● Compositional thread (Concerned with the narrative part of an experience) ● Spatio-temporal thread (Refers to space and time in which experiences take place) Chapter 7 – Data Gathering: Interviews: ● Usually synchronous and are often face-to-face. Questionnaires: ● Series of questions designed to be answered asynchronously. Five key Issues that require attention for any data gathering session to be successful: 1) Setting goals. 2) Identifying participants. 3) Relationship with participants. 4) Triangulation. 5) Pilot studies. Regarding setting goals: ● The goals that are set will influence the nature of the data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used and the analysis to be performed. Regarding identifying participants: ● Population (People who fit the indicated profile) ● Sampling (Most likely, you will need to choose the participants) ● Saturation sampling (rare, you have access to all members of your target population) Probability sampling (most common approaches): ● Simple random sampling (can be achieved by choosing every nth person in a list, or random number generator) ● Stratified sampling (relies on being able to divide the population into groups) Non-probability sampling common approaches (Relies less on your choice, rather the participants that are willing): ● Convenience sampling (those who were available rather than those specifically selected. ● Volunteer panels. Crucial difference between probability and non-probability sampling: ● In the former you can apply statistical tests and generalize the whole population, in the latter such generalizations are not robust. Regarding relationships with participants: ● Make sure the relationship is clear and professional, one way this can be achieved is by signing an informed consent form. Triangulation: ● Is a term used to refer to the investigation of a phenomenon from (at least) two different perspectives. Four types of triangulation: 1) Triangulation of data - means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in different places, or from different people. 2) Investigator triangulation - means that different researchers (observers, interviewers etc) have been used to collect and interpret the data. 3) Triangulation of theories - means the use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view the data or findings. 4) Methodological triangulation - means to employ different data gathering techniques. This is the most common form of triangulation. Pilot studies: ● A small trail of the main study. Aiming to ensure the proposed method is viable before embarking on the read study. Self-documenting forms of data gathering: ● Questionnaires ● Diaries ● Interaction logging ● Collecting work artifacts Three common data recording techniques: 1) Notes plus still camera. 2) Audio + still camera. 3) Video. Interviews (conversation with a purpose), types: ● Unstructured. ● Structured. ● Semi-structured. ● Focus groups. Developing interview questions: ● Questions may be open (unstructured) or closed (structured) or a combination (semi- structured). Questionnaire structure: ● Think about question ordering. ● Consider different versions (if needed) for different populations. ● Provide clear instructions. ● Strike balance between white space and keeping questionnaire as compact as possible. Questionnaire and response format: ● Check boxes and ranges. ● Rating scales. ● Likert scales. ● Semantic differential scales. Direct observation in the field: ● An observer who adopts an approach right at the outsider end of the spectrum is called a passive observer. ● An observer who adopts an approach at the insider end of this spectrum is called a participant observer, and attempts to become a full member of the group he is studying. Ethnography: ● Is a research method where the researcher observes from the point of view of the subject of the study (a participant observer), and observation is done without imposing any structure or framework - everything is viewed as \"strange\". The Think-Aloud Technique (In controlled environments): ● One of the problems with observation is that the observer doesn't know what users are thinking, and can only guess from what they see. Observation in the field should not be intrusive as this will disturb the very context you are trying to capture, so asking questions of the participant should be limited. However, in a controlled environment, the observer can afford to be a little more intrusive. The think-aloud technique is a useful way of understanding what is going on in a persons' head. Indirect observation: ● Diaries. ● Interaction logs and web analytics. Chapter 9 – The process of interaction design: Expectation management: ● Process of making sure the users’ expectations of the new product are realistic. Ownership: ● Users who are involved in the products’ development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership and support its use. User centered approach: ● The real users and their goals, not just the technology, are the driving force behind product development. Three principles are the basis for a user-centered approach: 1) Early focus on users and tasks 2) Empirical measurement 3) Iterative design Four basic activities of interaction design: 1) Establishing requirements 2) Designing alternatives 3) Prototyping 4) Evaluating Simple interaction design lifecycle model: Users: ● Those who interact directly with a product to achieve a task. Stakeholders: ● Are people or organizations who will be affected by the system and who have a direct or indirect influence on the system requirements. Usability engineering: ● The process of writing down formal, verifiable (measurable) usability criteria and then assessing the product against them. Some suggestions for measurable characteristics: ● Effectiveness: Appropriate support? ● Efficiency: Response time? ● Safety: How safe? How often does it crash / lose data? ● Utility: Which functions are superfluous, or not used often? ● Learnability: How long does a novice take to learn to do tasks? ● Memorability: How long does it take to remember how to perform common tasks? Chapter 10 – Establishing requirements: Requirement analysis: ● Normally used to describe the activity of investigating and analyzing an initial set of requirements that have been gathered, elicited, or captured. Requirements engineering: ● Is a better term than the others because it recognizes that developing a set of requirements is an iterative process of evolution and negotiation and one that needs to be carefully managed and controlled. Establishing requirements: ● This term represents the fact that requirements have been established from a sound understanding of the users’ needs. What are requirements: ● A statement about an intended product that specifies what it should do, or how it should perform. Different types of requirements: 1) Functional. 2) Data. 3) Environmental. ● Physical environment. ● Social environment. ● Organizational environment. ● Technical environment. 4) User characteristics. 5) Usability goals and user experience goals. Interviews: ● ◦ good at getting people to explore issues; ● ◦ can be structured, unstructured, or semi-structured; ● ◦ often used early to elicit scenarios; ● ◦ important for development team members to meet stakeholders, and for users to feel involved. Focus Groups / Workshops: ● ◦ good at gaining a consensus view and highlighting areas of conflict and disagreement; ● ◦ helps for stakeholders to meet designers and each other, and to express their views in public; ● ◦ Workshops have grown in popularity - carefully planned, attendees carefully chosen, and specific deliverables are produced. Questionnaires: ● ◦ used for getting initial responses that can then be analyzed to choose people to interview, or to get a wider perspective on issues that have arisen elsewhere; Direct Observation: ● ◦ observation of participants in their natural setting is used to understand the nature of the tasks and the context in which they are performed; ● ◦ sometimes carried out by trained observers who report back to the design team; ◦ sometimes carried out by, or with a member of the design team; ◦ ethnography is one form of this. Indirect Observation: ● ◦ Diaries and interaction logging are used less often where a new product is under development; ● ◦ if a product is evolving, such indirect observation is very valuable; ● ◦ interaction logging together with web analytics are particularly useful for improving websites. Studying Documentation: ● ◦ Manuals and other documentation are a good source of data about the steps involved in an activity, and any regulations governing a task; ● ◦ Documentation should not be used as the only source; ● ◦ good for understanding legislation and getting background information on the work; ● ◦ no stakeholder time, which is a limiting factor on the other techniques. Researching Similar Products: ● ◦ Look at similar products to generate alternative designs; ● ◦ helps to prompt requirements. Factors that influence data gathering techniques: ● Nature of the task ● Participants ● The analyst ● Resources available Contextual inquiry: ● An approach that emerged from the ethnographic approach to data gathering. It is tailored to gather data that can be used in design and it follows an apprenticeship model - the designer works as an apprentice to the user. The most typical format for contextual inquiry is a contextual interview, which is a combination of observation, discussion, and reconstruction of past events. Four main principles to contextual inquiry: ● Context principle (emphasizes the importance of going to the workplace and seeing what happens) ● Partnership principle (states that the developer and the user should collaborate in understanding the work - the understanding is developed through cooperation) ● Interpretation principle (states that the observation must be interpreted to be used in design, and this interpretation should also be developed in cooperation between the user and the developer) ● Focus principle (keep the data gathering focused on your goals) Data Gathering Guidelines for Requirements: ● Focus on identifying the stakeholders' needs; ● Involve all the stakeholder groups. make sure you get the views of all the right people; ● Involve more than one stakeholder from each group, so that you do not get a narrow view; ● Support the data gathering sessions with suitable props, such as task descriptions and prototypes. Scenario: ● Informal narrative description Use cases: ● Also, focus on user goals, but the emphasis is on a user-system interaction rather than the users' task itself. Essential use cases (also referred to as task cases): ● Represent abstractions from scenarios, i.e. they represent a more general case than a scenario embodies, and try to avoid the assumptions of a traditional use case. Task analysis: ● An umbrella term that covers techniques for investigating cognitive processes and physical actions, at a high level of abstraction and in minute detail. Hierarchical Task Analysis: ● Involves breaking down a task into subtasks, then sub-sub-tasks and so on. These are grouped as plans which specify how the tasks might be performed in an actual situation. ● HTA focuses on physical and observable actions that are performed, and includes looking at actions not related to software or an interactive product; ● HTA starts with a user goal, which is examined, and the main tasks for achieving it are identified; ● These tasks are then divided into sub-tasks where appropriate. Advantages of HTA: ● It lets you objectively compare alternative designs. ● It provides a good understanding of the interaction at whichever level of abstraction is appropriate. ● It supports design reuse. Chapter 12 – Introducing evaluation: Two main types of evaluation (based on when they are done): ● Formative evaluation (done during design). ● Summative evaluation (assess the finished product). Three broad categories of evaluation: 1) Controlled settings involving users (Examples are laboratories and living labs) 2) Natural settings involving users (Examples are online communities and public places) 3) Any settings not involving users - consultants and researchers critique, predict, and model aspects of the interface to identify the most obvious usability problems. Usability Testing: ● Involves collecting data using a combination of methods e.g. experiments, observation, questionnaires. ● Generally done in laboratories, although increasingly being done remotely or in natural settings. ● Primary goal is to determine whether an interface is usable by the intended user population to carry out the tasks for which it was designed. ● As users perform tasks, they may be recorded on video, their interactions with the software may be recorded, usually by logging software. ● User satisfaction questionnaires and interviews can also be used to elicit users' opinions. ● Observing users' reactions to an interactive product has helped developers understand usability issues that would be extremely difficult for them to glean simply through reading reports, or listening to presentations. Field studies: ● The aim is to evaluate people in their natural setting Field studies (primary used to): ● Help identify opportunities for new technology; ● Establish the requirements for a new design; ● Facilitate the introduction of new technology. Techniques not involving users: ● Heuristic evaluation - applies knowledge of typical users guided by rules of thumb. ● Cognitive walkthroughs - involve simulating a users' problem-solving process at each step in the human-computer dialogue, and checking to see how users progress from step to step in these interactions. ● Analytics - Is a technique for logging data either at a customers' site, or remotely. ● Models - Have been used primarily for comparing the efficacy of different interfaces for the same application. Chapter 15 – Evaluation: Inspections, Analytics, and Models: Heuristic evaluation: ● Is a usability inspection method (developed by Nielson) in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure, online help etc. conform to tried and tested principles. Nielsen's heuristics: ● Visibility of system status ● Match between system and the real world ● User control and freedom ● Consistency and standards ● Error prevention ● Recognition rather than recall ● Flexibility and efficiency of use ● Aesthetic and minimalist design ● Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors ● Help and documentation Three stages of heuristic evaluation: 1) The briefing session 2) The evaluation period 3) The debriefing session Walkthroughs: ● Walkthroughs are an alternative approach to heuristic evaluation for predicting users' problems without doing user testing. Cognitive walkthroughs: ● Cognitive walkthroughs involve simulating a users' problem solving process at each step in the human computer dialogue, checking to see if the users' goals and memory for actions can be assumed to lead to the next correct action. The steps involved in cognitive walkthroughs: 1) The characteristics of typical users are identified and documented and sample tasks are developed that focus on the aspects of the design to be evaluated. A clear sequence of the actions needed for the users to complete the task is produced. 2) A designer and one or more expert evaluators come together to do the analysis. 3) The evaluators walk through the action sequences for each task, and try to answer the following questions - a) Will the correct action be sufficiently evident to the user? - b) Will the user notice that the correct action is available? - c) Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly? 4) As the walkthrough is being done, a record of critical information is compiled. 5) The design is then revised to fix the problems presented. Pluralistic walkthroughs: ● Pluralistic walkthroughs are another type of walkthrough in which users, developers and usability experts work together to step through a scenario, discussing usability issues associated with dialogue elements involved in the scenario steps. Analytics: ● Is a method for evaluating user traffic through a system. When used to examine traffic on a website, or part of a website, it is known as web analytics. GOMS (goals, operators, methods, selection rules): ● Is a well-known predictive modelling technique. This is a generic term used to refer to a family of models that vary in their granularity concerning the aspects of the users' performance they model and make predictions about. These include the time it takes to perform tasks and the most effective strategies to use. Two of the most well-known GOMS techniques are - GOMS Model, and the keystroke level model (KLM) The GOMS Model : ● Goals - refer to a state the user wants to achieve (e.g. find a website); ● Operators - refer to the cognitive processes and physical actions that need to be performed to attain those goals (e.g. decide which search engine to use, think up and then enter a keyword into a search engine). The difference between a goal and an operator is that a goal is obtained, and an operator is executed. ● Methods - are learned procedures for accomplishing the goals. They consist of the exact sequence of steps required. ● Selection rules - are used to determine which method to select when there is more than one available for a given stage of a task. Keystroke Level Model (KLM): ● The KLM differs from GOMS in that it provides numerical predictions of user performance. Tasks can be compared in terms of the time it takes to perform them when using different strategies. The main benefit of making this kind of quantitative prediction is that different features of systems and applications can be easily compared to see which might be the most effective for performing specific kinds of tasks. ● The developers of KLM analyzed the findings of many empirical studies of user performance to derive a standard set of approximate times for the main kinds of operators used during a task. They could come with the average time it takes to carry out common physical actions (e.g.: press a key, click a mouse button), together with other aspects of user-computer interaction (e.g.: the time it takes to decide what to do, and the system response rate). ● This model allows for predictions to be made about how long it takes an expert user to perform a task. The predicted time is computed by describing the sequence of actions involved in the task and summing their approximate times (looked up from empirical data) - T(execute) = Tk + Tp + Th + Td + Tm + Tr ● Operators - K (keystroke); P (pointing); H (homing); D (drawing); M (mental preparation); R (system response time). Benefits of GOMS: ● Allows for comparative analysis to be performed for different interfaces, prototypes, or specifications relatively easily; ● KLM can be adapted for use with advanced cell phones. Limitations of GOMS: ● Not often used for evaluation purposes because of its highly limited scope - it can only model computer-based tasks that involve a small set of highly routine data-entry type tasks; ● It is intended to be used only for predicting expert performance, and does not allow for errors to be modelled. Fitts' Law: ● Predicts the time it takes to reach a target using a pointing device. ● Used to describe the time it takes to point at a target, based on the size of the object, and the distance to the object; ● Specifically, it is used to model the time it takes to use a mouse and other input devices to click on objects on a screen; ● One of its main benefits is that it can help designers decide where to locate buttons, what size they should be, and how close together they should be on a screen display; ● T = k log2 (D/S + 1.0) where: T = time to move the pointer to a target D = distance between the pointer and the target S = size of the target k is a constant of approximately 200ms/bit. ● In short, the bigger the target, the easier and quicker it is to reach it; ● Fitts’ law predicts that the most quickly accessed targets on any computer display are the four corners of the screen; ● Fitts’ law is useful for evaluating systems for which the time to locate an object is critical - such as handheld devices like mobile phones.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
