If I bought a lottery ticket last month then I did not win the lottery last week and if I won the lottery last week then I am happy Question 1.2 Question 1.3 ¬p q ¬r (p→(p and q)) →r 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 The sequent is not valid because on line 4 the premises are true and conclusion is false Question 1.4 (𝑇 → 𝑝) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑇 → 𝑞) ∧ (𝑟 ∧ 𝑠 →⊥) ∧ (𝑞 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑞 → 𝑟) Mark all T (𝑇 → 𝑝) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑇 → 𝑞) ∧ (𝑟 ∧ 𝑠 →⊥) ∧ (𝑞 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑞 → 𝑟) Mark all p (𝑇 → 𝑝) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑇 → 𝑞) ∧ (𝑟 ∧ 𝑠 →⊥) ∧ (𝑞 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑞 → 𝑟) Mark all q (𝑇 → 𝑝) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑇 → 𝑞) ∧ (𝑟 ∧ 𝑠 →⊥) ∧ (𝑞 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑞 → 𝑟) Mark all r (𝑇 → 𝑝) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑇 → 𝑞) ∧ (𝑟 ∧ 𝑠 →⊥) ∧ (𝑞 ∧ 𝑠 → 𝑟) ∧ (𝑝 ∧ 𝑞 → 𝑟) Nothing more can be marked and ⊥ hasn’t been marked, so the original Horn formular is “Satisfiable” Question 2 Question 2.1 i. For every x, if x is a student, then some y, where y is a professor and x respects y • All students respect their professors ii. ∃𝑥(𝐶(𝑥) → 𝐵(ℎ, 𝑥, 𝑗)) Question 2.2 i. Not wff, predicate cannot contain a quantifier ii. Wff iii. Wff iv. Not wff, fuction should be in a predicate v. Wff Question 2.3 Question 2.4 Question 3 Question 3.1 i. determine whether it holds in the above Kripke model a. 𝑥1 ╟ □ 𝑝 ∧ □ 𝑞 • Does not hold , because p or q is not true in all worlds accessible from x1 b. 𝑥2 ╟ □ □ 𝑞 • Does not hold, because □ 𝑞 is not true in all worlds accessible from x2 c. x3 ╟ ◊ T d. 𝑥4 ╟ □(𝑝 ∧ 𝑞) ∧ ¬ ◊ 𝑝 • Holds: holds vacuously in x4 (because there are no worlds accessible from x4) ii. Rewrite as ¬𝑝 ∨ □ ◊ q • For x1 it is not true because the there is no world accessible form x1 where ◊ q is true • For x2 it is not true because the ¬𝑝 is not true in x2 Question 3.2 1. Not valid because it will not always be true that ∅ 2. Valid : if it will always be true that ∅ then it will always be true that it will always be true that ∅ x1 x2 p Question 3.3 i. We Ought to play against Australia and we are not permitted to play against Australia ii. ◊ 𝑝 → ¬□𝑞 Question 3.4 i. If Agent K1 knows p and q then Agent 2 knows p and q and he doesn’t know that K1 knows p and q ii. K3K1p V K2 ¬K1p Question 3.4","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
