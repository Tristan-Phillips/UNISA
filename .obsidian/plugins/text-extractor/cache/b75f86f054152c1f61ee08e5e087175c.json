Information collected and processed 0 = Information extracted are not presented, explained and processed. 1= Information extracted, presented and processed are not relevant to the organisation and/or database problem identified. = Student demonstrated inadequate ability on how to locate and present appropriate information that are relevant for the formulation of business rules. = Student demonstrated adequate ability on how to locate and present appropriate information that are relevant for the formulation of business rules but the information collected and presented are insufficient. = Student demonstrated adequate ability on how to locate and present appropriate information that are relevant for the formulation of business rules and the information collected are sufficient. Business rules proposed 0 = No business rules 2 = Business rules proposed/reported are ambiguous.= Business rules proposed/reported are unambiguous but are not related to the information extracted for the database design. = Business rules proposed are unambiguous, well- presented, relevant to the information extracted but are not complete (some elements are missing according to the information extracted).= Business rules proposed/reported are Page 3 of 7 Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 unambiguous, well-presented, relevant to the information extracted and are complete (no elements are missing according to the information extracted). OUTCOME 3 Demonstrate a good understanding of principles underpinning the development of database models and proposed adequate database design model Evidence shows student discuss and explain the design approach used Database Design approach 0 = No design approach. 1 = Discussion of database design approaches. 2 = Design approach do not correlate with the database problems= Adequate design approach but without justification.= Adequate design approach with proper justification. Evidence shows that the student developed a conceptual database design Conceptual Database Design  Main entities  Primary and foreign keys  Normalised entities  ER diagram 0 = No conceptual design. 1 = The entities listed are not related to the database being design.2 = The entities listed are related to the database being designed but they are not heighted in the business rule presented. = The entities listed are related to the database being designed but only 1/4 of the entities in the business rules are covered. = The entities listed are related to the database being designed but only 1/2 of the entities in the business rules are covered. = The entities listed are related to the database being designed and all the entities in the business rules are covered but with limited description. = The entities listed are related to the database being designed and all the entities in the business rules are covered but with sufficient description. Evidence shows that the student developed a Logical database Design  Relational model 0 = No logical design. 1 = The logical design is not speaking to the conceptual phase. Page 4 of 7 Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 logical database design  Integrity constraints 2 = The logical design is speaking to the conceptual phase but only 1/2 of the elements are covered with limited description. = The logical design is speaking to the conceptual phase and only 1/2 of the elements are covered with adequate description. = The logical design is speaking to the conceptual phase and all the elements are covered but with limited description. = The logical design is speaking to the conceptual phase and all the elements are covered with sufficient description. Evidence shows that the student developed a physical database design Physical database Design  Composite/Transaction usage map  Estimation of hard disk space 0 = No physical design. 1 = Physical design entities are not related to the conceptual phase. = 1/2 of the elements are covered but with limited description. = 1/2 of the elements are covered with adequate description. = All the elements are covered but with limited description. = All the elements are covered with sufficient description. OUTCOME 4 Demonstrate the ability to efficiently manage database transaction at the conceptual level. Evidence shows learned formulate transactional queries in line with the objectives. Define and explained transactions 0 = No definition and explanations of database transactions. = Unclear definition and explanation of database transactions. = Limited definition and explanation of database transactions. = Adequate definition and explanation of database transactions.= Advanced definition and explanation of database transactions. Page 5 of 7 Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 Formulate possible SQL statements for the database 0 = No SQL statements presented. 0 = SQL Statements presented are not relevant to generate report/answer from the database. = Limited use of SQL statements. 3 = Basic use of SQL statements. 4 = Advanced use of SQL statements. = Advanced use of SQL statements and the statements are relevant to generate answer/report from the database. OUTCOME 5 Demonstrate an understanding of methods applied to optimise database performances Evidence shows the learner proposed a database performance optimisation approach Discussion of different database performance turning methods and/or concepts 0 = No database performance turning discussed. 1 = Limited discussion of different database performance turning concepts/methods. 3 = Adequate discussion of different database performance turning concepts/methods. 5 = Extensive discussion of different database Performance turning concepts/methods. Questions and Answers 3 = Challenges encountered are highlighted and how you handle them are explain. = How do you think this assignment can be improved in the future? Report layout Instructions: The report should be a minimum of 15 pages and a maximum of 20 pages. The pages should be numbered (bottom centre) 0 = None of the prescribed layout and page restriction are applied. = Some of the prescribed layout and page restriction are applied. = Reasonable prescribe layout or page restriction are applied.= Professional layout applied. Page 6 of 7 Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 Include table of content Use “time new romans” Font size 12 The paragraphs should be justified and single spacing. Letter of permission and declaration If the two documents are completed, signed and attached to the final report If not Award student full mark obtained for the assignment. Deduct 10 mark from the student mark. Case base company or real-world company As indicated in the assignment 02 information document, extra 5 marks will be awarded to students that put extra effort to find real-world organisations, schools, business, or NGOs. The reason for this is that the assignment is designed to make students gain a real-world experience for instance how to generate business requirement. © UNISA 2020 Page 7 of 7 Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
