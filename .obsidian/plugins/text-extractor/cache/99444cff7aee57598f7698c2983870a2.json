Extensively comment on this fundamental shift in computing from the desktop to portable and then to mobile devices, and in particular comment on the usability problems and opportunities (such as touch interfaces) that this will bring. Hint – Structure your discussion by using one of the usability evaluation frameworks or usability property/principles classification schemes, to show and discuss which potential usability problems and opportunities may have occurred or will occur, during this shift. 1.2 In HCI we consider how interactive systems can be designed to provoke or avoid emotional responses within users. Use the following three aspects of emotional interaction or affective computing as subheadings and explain how interfaces and interaction experiences can cause emotions in the user. In each subsection, give examples of specific techniques or objects that elicit various kinds of emotional responses. The subheadings are expressive interfaces, frustrating interfaces and persuasive interfaces. Expressive Interfaces Emoticons, dynamic icons, animations, spoken messages, sounds and vibro-tactile feedback can be used on an interface to convey different emotional states and elicit certain kinds of emotional responses in users, such as feeling at ease, comfort, and happiness. Emoticons are keyboard symbols that are combined together in ways to convey feelings and emotions by simulating facial expressions such as smiling, winking and frowning etc. They not only convey an emotional state but can also elicit an emotional response relevant to the context they are used in. Dynamic icons are icons that have special functions and indicted the current state of the computer (e.g. a recycle bin expanding when a file is placed in it and paper disappears in a pug when emptied). Animations can also indicate the state of the computer and are can reassure the user of what is going to happen (e.g. a beach ball whirling to say the computer is busy) Spoken messages using voices, tell the user what he needs to do (GPS navigation system instructing you not to take a wrong turn) Sounds can indicate actions or events (e.g. whoosh for a window closing and schlook for file being dragged, ding for new emails) Vibro-tactile feedback can also inform you of what is going on or about to happen (e.g. cell phone buzzes that represent messages, calls etc.) The style of these interfaces and the way they are combined can also influence the emotional impact they have. They can be satisfying and pleasurable to use depending on how they are designed and where they are used. Frustrating Interfaces These types of interfaces elicit negative emotional responses such as anger, disgust and can cause a something simple to use to be complex. Gimmicks – clicking on a website link to discover it’s still under construction Error Messages – cause users to become anxious Waiting – websites that take long to download or eventually don’t load at all are annoying Upgrading – requires user to change preferences and learn a new way to do something is time consuming and frustrating for the user Appearance – overloaded with text, graphics, flashing animations, childish designs and too many buttons and controls can annoy the user Persuasive Interfaces Pop-up ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages and recommendations are used to draw people’s attention to certain kinds of information in the attempt to change what they do or think. 1.3 (a) What is a conceptual model? A conceptual model is a high-level description of a product in terms of what users can do with it and the concept they need to understand how to interact with it. (b) Briefly describe the four components that make up a conceptual model (as from Johnson and Henderson) • Metaphors and analogies – convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity • Concepts – people are exposed to through product, task-domain objects that create and manipulate, attributes and operations that can be performed on them (e.g. saving, revisiting, organising) • Relationships between concepts – whether one object contains another, the relative importance of actions to others, whether an object is part of another) • Mappings – between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke 1.4 (a) Explain the concepts of users and stakeholders and how they differ User – the people who interact directly with the product to achieve a task Stakeholder – people or organisations who will be affected by the system and who have a direct or indirect influence on the system requirements (b) Name all the groups of stakeholders involved in the design of the hardware and software of a modern cell phone. Explain your choices. Designers – design the look and feel of the phone including colours etc. Managers – of cell phone companies Software developers – develop the software that allows the cell phone to function Users – the people who will use the end product Technicians and Sales Reps – sell and fix the product once completed QUESTION 2 Hueristic evaluation is an informal usability inspection technique developed by Jakob Nielson and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure, on-line help etc. conform to the principles. Discuss heuristic evaluation under the following headings: (a) The heuristics • Visibility of system status • Match between system and real world • User control and freedom • Consistency and standards • Error prevention • Recognition rather than recall • Flexibility and efficiency of use • Aesthetic and minimalist design • Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors • Help and documentation (b) The three stages of doing heuristic evaluation 1) The briefing session Experts are told what to do and a prepared script acts as a useful guide to ensure each person receives the same briefing. 2) The evaluation period Each expert spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using heuristics for guidance. They take at least 2 passes through the interface and the first pass give a feel for the flow of interaction and the product’s scope. The second pass allows evaluators to focus on specific interface elements in context of the whole product, and identify potential usability problems. If evaluating a functioning product, evaluators need specific user tasks so that exploration is focused. While working through the interface, specification, or mock- ups, a second person may record the problems identified, or the evaluator may think aloud. 3) The debriefing session Evaluators come together to discuss findings and prioritize problems they found and suggest solutions. (c) Heuristics for the web • Clarity Make the system as clear, concise, and meaningful as possible for the intended audience - Write clear, concise copy - Use technical language for technical audience - Write clear and meaningful labels - Use meaningful icons • Minimize unnecessary complexity and cognitive load Make the system as simple as possible for users to accomplish their tasks - Remove unnecessary functionality, process steps, and visual clutter - Use progressive disclosure to hide advanced features - Break down complicated processes into multiple steps - Prioritize using size, shape, colour, alignment and proximity • Provide users with context Interfaces should provide users with a sense of context in time and space - Provide clear site name and purpose - Highlight the current section in the navigation - Provide a breadcrumb trail - Use appropriate feedback messages - Show number of steps in process - Reduce perception of latency by providing visual cues or by allowing users to complete other tasks while waiting • Promote a pleasurable and positive user experience The user should be treated with respect and the design should be aesthetically pleasing and promote a pleasurable and rewarding experience - Create a pleasurable and attractive design - Provide easily attainable goals - Provide rewards for usage and progression (d) Possible problems with heuristic evaluation - Can report problems that don’t exist - Can miss some of the users problems Heuristic evaluation should not be thought of as a replacement for user testing. It is a good idea to have several evaluators doing heuristic evaluation to help reduce the impact of one person’s experience or poor performance. QUESTION 3 3.1 It is likely that your cell phone makes use of all four fundamental types of interaction (instructing, conversing, manipulating and exploring). Briefly describe each of the four interaction types and give examples of how each interaction type is represented in your cell phone. 1) Instructing Instructing describes how users carry out their tasks by telling the system what to do. With a cell phone you can select options from the screen and press buttons to make a call. 2) Conversing Conversing is based on the idea of a person having a conversation with a system, where the system acts as a dialog partner. With a cell phone you can speak into the phone and ask the phone to dial a number stored in it. 3) Manipulating Users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them (e.g. opening, holding, closing, and placing). With my iphone I can select by touching an icon and drag it into a file with other similar icons, play games, delete apps etc all though manipulation. 4) Exploring Users move through a virtual environment or physical space like 3D worlds and augmented and virtual reality systems. It enables users to hone familiar knowledge of physically moving around. It uses sensor-based technologies that include smart rooms and ambient environments, also enabling people to capitalize on familiarity. 3.2 Consider your personal cell phone. Choose four of Preece et al’s user experience goals. For each of the four goals, explain the goal briefly, give a cell phone example such as describing how it is implemented in your cell phone (or not). 1) Entertaining 2) Annoying 3) Fun 4) Supporting creativity 3.3 Again consider your cell phone, paying particular attention to the emotional responses it generates within you when you use it. Define and explain the four core threads of the Technology as Experience Framework Model. Apply these concepts to using your cell phone, giving examples. 1) The sensual thread - Concerned with sensory engagement and is concerned with the level of absorption people have with various technological devices and applications. - When using my cell phone I feel comfort using my favourite app! - When using my cell phone I feel pain when it is about to run out of charge or cannot connect to the 3G ;-) 2) The emotional thread - Concerned with the emotions such as sorrow, anger, joy and happiness and how they are intertwined with the situation in which they arise. - I chose my cell phone because of all the additional applications and usability that it would offer and I feel happy using it. E.g. The joys of doing online banking off your cell phone app whilst on the road and out of the office and the convenience which it offers. 3) The compositional thread - Concerned with the narrative part of an experience as it unfolds, and the way a person makes sense of them. - When logging in to my mobile banking app and suddenly losing internet connection it can lead to a frustrating experience and internal thinking of what to do next to rectify the sitatuation. 4) The spatio-temporal thread - Refers to the space and time in which our experiences take place and their effect upon those experiences. - When playing one of the games on my phone it can feel like time standing still or sloing down.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
