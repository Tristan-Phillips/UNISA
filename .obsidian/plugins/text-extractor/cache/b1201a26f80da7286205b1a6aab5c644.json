Based on your answer to 1 1, write code for the necessary class header files so that such reflective programming can be utiised. 5) 1.3 Suppose that a validator attached to an entry field is to be used to ensure that the image size is entered correctly Using the code below, answer the following questions 1 QRegExp requiredFormat (/* regular expression */), 2 QLineRdit stringEntry = new QLineEdit; 3 /* type */ validString = /* enter code here */; 4. stringEntry->setValidator(validStrang); {a) Which anti-pattem is being avoided by checking input values? (1) (b) Provide a regular expression for ine 1 that would ensure that at least 1 digit is entered, and that the initial digit is not 0. Furthermore, 1f a point 1s used, it must be followed by at least one digit. Note that the decimal part is optional. @) {¢) Wnte code for line 3 above That is, what sort of object 1s needed for the setvalidator () function i line 42 2) Question 2 [27 marks] An Inputoutput class will be used to generate output in vanous formats and read in data from vanous formats The constructor will set a dala member 1ist to the 1 parameter passed to it. class InputOutput { public. InputOutput (QList<Image> 1); QString toString() const; QList<Image> readXML(QString filename), private QList<Image> list, QDomDocument. doc; i [TURN OVER]","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
