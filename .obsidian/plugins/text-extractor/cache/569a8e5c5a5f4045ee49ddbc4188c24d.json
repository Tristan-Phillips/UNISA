Icons and animations have been used to convey the current state of a computer. e.g. The apple icon which showed a computer happy face when the system booted up and a sad face if something wasn’t right. Other ways of conveying the system status is by using vibro-tactile feedback indicating a message or a change. Voice feedback such as a GPS navigation system informing users where to turn. Dynamic icons like the recycle bin being emptied or the sound of a file closing with a swoosh sound. The arrangement of fonts, shapes, line etc can also elicit certain feelings of ease. Annoying interfaces: Annoying interfaces are those interfaces that illicit negative emotions such as anger and disgust. Interfaces that crash and don’t work properly, ones that don’t do what the user wants them to do, Vague error messages, help that doesn’t help, Doesn’t meet user expectations. Cutsey, garish and gimmicky interfaces. Webpages which are with text and graphics making it difficult to find information. Flashing ads, moving banners, animations which require the user to close them. Featuritis – an excessive number of operations, such as the array of buttons on remote controls. Poorly laid out keyboards, pads, control panels, and other input devices that cause users to persistently press the wrong keys or buttons. persuasive technology: A diversity of technologies is increasingly being used to draw people's attention to certain kinds of information in an attempt to change what they do or think. Pop-up ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, and recommendations are some of the methods that are being deployed on computer screens. interactive computing systems are deliberately designed to change people's attitudes and behaviors. More recently, interactive techniques have been used to entice, cajole, and persuade people to do something they might not have otherwise done. Successful examples include Amazon's one-click mechanism that makes it so easy and tempting to buy something at their online store, and recommender systems that suggest specific books, hotels, restaurants, etc a reader might want to try based on their previous purchases, choices, and taste. Splash pages to online shopping sites and color images of gorgeous-looking beach and mountain scenes on travel sites are designed to lure people into making impulse purchases. In addition to using interactive technologies as a more targeted and personalized form of advertising, they can be used to change people's behaviors in non- commercial domains, such as safety, preventative healthcare, fitness, personal relationships, energy consumption, and learning. Here, the emphasis is on changing habits or doing something that will improve an individual's well-being through monitoring their behavior. 1.2 How Can the design of a technology change the attitude and behaviour of people (11 marks) A well designed product that provides the user with a feeling of ease, comfort and happiness is often times perceived by the user as having good utility. The style of an interface, in terms of the shapes, fonts, colors, balance, white space, and graphical elements that are used and the way they are combined, can also influence its emotional impact. Use of imagery at the interface can result in more engaging and enjoyable experiences The design of aesthetically pleasing interfaces has become of central concern to interaction design. Empirical studies have shown that the aesthetics of an interface can have a positive effect on people's perception of the system's usability. When the look and feel of an interface is pleasing and pleasurable – e.g. beautiful graphics, nice feel to the way the elements have been put together, well-designed fonts, elegant use of images and color, a good sense of balance – users are likely to be more tolerant. Good design that is effective, easy to learn and provides a good user experience makes users feeling happy and provides good utility. Users might be enticed to take the stairs rather than the elevator because of a design that encourages users to use the stairs. Children may learn how to look after a pet by having to look after a robotic pet. People may reduce their energy consumption, reduce their water usage, be fitter, learn more skills and be more social able if the product is designed well. 2 Question 2 [12 marks] 2.1 Discuss McCarthy and Wright (2004)'s four core threads that make up holistic experiences (12 marks) Sensual Thread Emotional Thread Compositional Thread Spacio-Temporal thread 3 Question 3 [15 marks] 3.1 Explain the role of software design principles (4 marks) The role of software design principals is used as a set of guidelines that designers need to keep in the forfront on their minds when designing a good product. These principals are not prescriptive yet, they serve as tested methods for designing products that are Easy to learn, Effective to user and provide a good user experience. They also minimise costly mistakes. 3.2 List five design principles that are concerned with how to determine what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an Interactive product according to Prcece et al (2015) (5 marks) Feedback Visibility Affordance Constraints Consistency 3.3 One of the mam design principles for website design IS simplicity Nielsen proposed that designers go through all their design elements and remove them one by one If a design works Just well without an element, then Just remove It Do you think this IS a good design principle Discuss (6 marks) Simplicity is very important in that an interface that is too busy detracts from the message or actual content it is purposed for. Clean lines, a good balance of white space, well written text, well balanced graphics are all important. And if a website works well without an element I do agree even though it might be hard to do. One must just ensure that the website is not left too bland, with only text and nothing aesthetically pleasing. An elegant design has a good balance between what is on the page and what is not. 4 Question 4 [25 marks] 4.1 Which are the five key Issues that require attention for any data gathering session to become successful (10 marks) • Setting goals: Without a predefined goal of what the data gathering technique is supposed to accomplish, one cannot effectively identify what is the best method to gather data, who are the participants and what data analysis to perform. • identify the participants: Based on the goal of data gathering, a population of users who fit the profile of what information needs to be gleaned is established. • Relationship with the participants: The relationships with participants needs to needs to be clear cut and professional to clarify the nature of the study. It might helpful to provide a consent form to establish for participants to complete. • Triangulation: Involves get different perspectives either by employing different theories, methodologies, different users, different evaluators. • Pilot Studies: A pilot studies is a pre-run of the data gathering exercise. This establish if there are any flaws in the data extraction method and rectify before going ‘live’. 4.2 What should be avoided when designing interview questions' (5 marks) Avoid using compound sentences. Use simple sentences. Avoid using Jargon and rather opt for laymans terms Avoid questions that create biased answers Avoid asking questions in an illogical order Avoid using probing questions in the beginning. Do not expect interview questions to directly answer your research aim. Interview questions should follow some order. Do not ask abrupt questions Avoid questions that are not related to interview goals. The type of data recording should not interfere with the interview proceeding 4.3 Discuss any five advantages of Involving users during software development (10 marks) • Understanding of user goals and pain points: Developers gain a better understanding of user’s goals • A more appropriate product more usable products are developed. The user is the one who interacts with the system every day • Expectation Management: User’s expectaions are managed if they are involved. They will understand the limitations of the system as well as what the system can do when deployed. Under promise / over deliver. • Training can also be minimised. A user will already be familiarised with the product and how . the system will be used and affect their jobs. • Ownership: User’s that take ownership of the product by being involved in it are more likely to adopt the use thereof. • Cost saving: Reducing costs of patches and redesigning when expectations haven’t been met. 5 Question 5 [18 marks] Heuristic evaluation IS an Informal usability Inspection technique developed by Nielson and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure or on- line help conform to the principles Discuss heuristic evaluation under the following headings 5.1 Briefly discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation (6 marks) Briefing: Evaluators are briefed as to the purpose of the evaluation, whether is it for a whole system, a portion of the system or a dialog. It is advisable to provide a script to all the evaluators so that each evaluator does the evaluation in the same order and the evaluation has been done consistently. Evaluation: Each evaluator takes about 1 – 2 hours to complete the evaluations and 2 passes through the system. The first is a general overview and the second is more precise looking for usability problems. Debriefing: In which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings, prioritise problems and suggest possible solutions. 5.2 Schneiderman’s eight golden rules are used as heuristics for Identifying usability problems, discuss the four selected rules (12) 5.2.1 Cater for universal usability (3 marks) Recognise the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Users have varying needs, the context where users use products, their access to facilities, whether they are novice users or advanced users, varying technological diversity. Adding features for novices and say shortcuts for expert users can enrich perceived system quality. 5.2.2 Permit easy reversal of actions (3 marks) Reversal of actions can be for one character, one action, one database entry or a group of functions. Creating undo/redo options creates a feeling of ease and enables users to further explore the system because of the security that undo or redo provides. 5.2.3 Support Internal locus (3 marks) Internal locus focuses on the systems abilities to enable users to do what they want to do. In other words, the user is empowered to changes settings, customise layouts and perform advanced tasks. 5.2.4 Design dialogues to Yield closure (3 marks) Each sequence of actions has a beginning, middle and an end. When a group of actions is done, the user feel satisfaction at having achieved their goals, relief that the action has been done, no need to follow any contingency plans and the ability to start working on the next group of actions. Ecommerce>search>select>checkout>Pay>Done 6 According to Nielsen and Mack (1994), cognitive walkthroughs Involve simulating a user's problem-solving process at each step in the human computer dialog, checking to see If the user's goals and memory for actions can be assumed to lead to the next correct action Discuss each of the five steps Involved In cognitive walkthroughs (10 marks) 6.1 The characteristics of typical users are identified and documented and sample tasks are developed that focus on the aspects of the design to be evaluated. A clear sequence of the actions needed for the users to complete the task is produced. 6.2 A designer and one or more expert evaluators come together to do the analysis. 6.3 3) The evaluators walk through the action sequences for each task, and try to answer the following questions 6.3.1 Will the correct action be sufficiently evident to the user? 6.3.2 Will the user notice that the correct action is available? 6.3.3 Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly? 6.4 As the walkthrough is being done, a record of critical information is compiled. 6.5 The design is then revised to fix the problems presented.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
