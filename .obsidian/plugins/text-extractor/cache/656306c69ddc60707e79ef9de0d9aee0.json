COS3751 October/November 2022 QUESTION PAPER 2 [TURN PAGE] (a) Explain the term “fully observable environment” in Artificial Intelligence. (5) (b) What is deterministic or stochastic environment? Describe your response using a game of chess. (5) (c) Distinguish between discrete and continuous environment. Give an example of each. (5) Question 1 Intelligent Agents & State Space [15] COS3751 October/November 2021 QUESTION PAPER 3 (a) Define the concept abstraction and why is it important in state description? (3) (b) Considering the following diagram: (i) Employing an A-star search, where L is the goal whereby there is horizontally and vertically movement and the cost to move from one square to the next is 1 while employing Manhattan-distance heuristic. Supposing the start node is S. Calculate the frontier after S is expanded. Include f, g, h values for each node place in the frontier. (6) (ii) Identify all nodes that will be expanded using A-star search? (8) Question 2 Searching [17] COS3751 October/November 2021 QUESTION PAPER 4 Consider the game tree in Figure 2 and then answer the questions that follow. (The static utility values for the leaf nodes are provided below each leaf node, and node A is a MAX node.) (a) Provide the backed-up utility values for all the non-leaf nodes in the tree if a minimax search is performed. (4) (b) Suppose that alpha/beta pruning is applied during the search. Write down the α and β values associated with nodes B, E, F and G (after the search completes). NB: Write down the node as well as the α and β values for that node. The search should use left to right order. (6) (c) Is there any benefit in applying alpha/beta pruning to this search? (2) Question 3 Adversarial Search [12] COS3751 October/November 2021 QUESTION PAPER 5 Consider the following cryptarithmetic puzzle: S U N + M O O N P L U T O Re-write the puzzle in terms of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). (a) Define the variables for the puzzle. (2) (b) Define the constraints on the variables. (6) (c) What is the meaning of the term “minimum remaining values (MRV)” heuristic and “usefulness” in the constraint satisfaction problem. (3) (d) Provide the solution to this cryptarithmetic puzzle problem. Show all your steps and calculations. (8) Question 4 Constraint Satisfaction Problems [19] COS3751 October/November 2021 QUESTION PAPER 6 The following statements are specified in English: 1. Whatever anyone eats and is not poisoned by it is called food. 2. Mark drinks any type of drink. 3. Orange juice is a drink. 4. Chicken is food. 5. Bill eats peanuts and is not poisoned by it. 6. Dora eats all that Bill eats. (a) Convert the statements to First Order Logic statements. The first statement has been shown below as example. Convert the rest using a standardized variable. (6) 1. ∀y,z[eats(y,z)∧￢poisoned from eating(y,z)⇒food(z)] (b) Convert all of the FOL statements above to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) (including the statement that was provided). Hint: Please ensure all the statement are in CNF. (7) (c) Employ resolution refutation to prove that Mark eats peanuts, using the assumptions provided in the paragraph above. (9) Question 5 Resolution Refutation [22] COS3751 October/November 2021 QUESTION PAPER 7 Consider the following data in Table 1, which comprises of three binary input attributes (A1, A2, and A3), and one binary output y: Example A1 A2 A3 y X1 0 1 0 0 X2 0 1 1 0 X3 1 0 0 0 X4 1 1 1 1 X5 1 1 0 1 Table 1: Data Set Using the principles of Information Gain build a decision tree for the data. Show the computations made to determine the attribute to split at each node. Use the table A for the entropy calculations. Also show the decision tree: branch and leaf nodes, as well as edges and appropriate labels for the edges.
