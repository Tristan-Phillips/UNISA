Command 2. Graphical 3. Multimedia 4. Virtual reality 5. Web 6. Mobile 7. Appliance 8. Voice 9. Pen 10. Touch 11. Gesture 12. Haptic 13. Multimodal 14. Shareable 15. Tangible 16. Augmented Reality 17. Wearables 18. Robots and drones 19. Brain–computer interaction 20. Smart Command line interfaces • Commands such as abbreviations (e.g. ls) typed in at the prompt to which the system responds (e.g. listing current files) • Some are hard wired at keyboard, others can be assigned to keys • Efficient, precise, and fast • Large overhead to learning set of commands www.id-book.com Second Life command-based interface for visually impaired users www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Form, name types and structure are key research questions • Consistency is most important design principle – e.g. always use first letter of command • Command interfaces popular for web scripting www.id-book.com Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) • Xerox Star first WIMP gave rise to GUIs • Windows – Sections of the screen that can be scrolled, stretched, overlapped, opened, closed, and moved around the screen using the mouse • Icons – Pictograms that represent applications, objects, commands, and tools that were opened when clicked on • Menus – lists of options that can be scrolled through and selected • Pointing device – a mouse controlling the cursor as a point of entry to the windows, menus, and icons on the screen www.id-book.com Example of 1st generation GUI www.id-book.com Simple smartwatch menus with 1, 2 or 3 options www.id-book.com Window design • Windows were invented to overcome physical constraints of a computer display – enable more information to be viewed and tasks to be performed • Scroll bars within windows enable more information to be viewed • Multiple windows can make it difficult to find desired one – listing, tabbing, thumbnails, are techniques that can help www.id-book.com Window design: Thumbnails of top websites visited and suggested highlights www.id-book.com Selecting a country from a scrolling window www.id-book.com Is this method any better? www.id-book.com Menu styles • Flat list - good for showing large number of options at the same time when display is small • Drop down – show more options on same screen – e.g. cascading • Pop-up – when press command key for relevant options • Contextual – provide access to often used commands associated with a particular item • Collapsible – toggle between + and - icons on a header to expand or contract its contents • Mega – all options shown using 2D drop-down layout www.id-book.com Template for a collapsible menu www.id-book.com A mega menu www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Window management – enables users to move fluidly between different windows (and monitors) • How to switch attention between windows without getting distracted • Design principles of spacing, grouping, and simplicity should be used • Which terms to use for menu options (e.g. “Front” versus “bring to front” • Mega menus easier to navigate than drop-down ones www.id-book.com Icon design • Icons are assumed to be easier to learn and remember than commands • Can be designed to be compact and variably positioned on a screen • Now pervasive in every interface – e.g. represent desktop objects, tools (e.g. paintbrush), applications (e.g. web browser), and operations (e.g. cut, paste, next, accept, change) www.id-book.com Icons • Since the Xerox Star days icons have changed in their look and feel: – black and white -> color, shadowing, photorealistic images, 3D rendering, and animation • Many designed to be very detailed and animated making them both visually attractive and informative • Can be highly inviting, emotionally appealing, and feel alive www.id-book.com Icon forms • The mapping between the representation and underlying referent can be: – similar (e.g., a picture of a file to represent the object file) – analogical (e.g., a picture of a pair of scissors to represent ‘cut) – arbitrary (e.g., the use of an X to represent ‘delete’) • Most effective icons are similar ones • Many operations are actions making it more difficult to represent them – use a combination of objects and symbols that capture the salient part of an action www.id-book.com 2 types of icon styles www.id-book.com Flat 2D icons for smartphone and smartwatch www.id-book.com Activity • Sketch simple icons to represent the following operations to appear on a digital camera screen: – Turn image 90 degrees sideways – Auto-enhance the image – Crop the image – More options • Show them to someone else and see if they can understand what each represents www.id-book.com Basic edit icons that appear on the iPhone app www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • There is a wealth of resources for creating icons – guidelines, style guides, icon builders, libraries, online tutorials • Text labels can be used alongside icons to help identification for small icon sets • For large icon sets (e.g. photo editing or word processing) can use the hover function www.id-book.com Multimedia • Combines different media within a single interface with various forms of interactivity – graphics, text, video, sound, and animations • Users click on links in an image or text -> another part of the program -> an animation or a video clip is played ->can return to where they were or move on to another place • Can provide better ways of presenting information than can a single media www.id-book.com Pros and cons • Facilitates rapid access to multiple representations of information • Can provide better ways of presenting information than can any media alone • Can enable easier learning, better understanding, more engagement, and more pleasure • Can encourage users to explore different parts of a game or story • Tendency to play video clips and animations, while skimming through accompanying text or diagrams www.id-book.com Multimedia learning app designed for tablet www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • How to design multimedia to help users explore, keep track of, and integrate the multiple representations – provide hands-on interactivities and simulations that the user has to complete to solve a task – Provide quizzes, electronic notebooks, and games • Multimedia good for supporting certain activities, such as browsing but less optimal for reading at length www.id-book.com Virtual reality • Computer-generated graphical simulations providing: – “the illusion of participation in a synthetic environment rather than external observation of such an environment” (Gigante, 1993) • Provide new kinds of experience, enabling users to interact with objects and navigate in 3D space • Create highly engaging user experiences www.id-book.com Pros and cons • Can have a higher level of fidelity with objects they represent compared to multimedia • Induces a sense of presence where someone is totally engrossed by the experience – “a state of consciousness, the (psychological) sense of being in the virtual environment” (Slater and Wilbur, 1999) • Provides different viewpoints: 1st and 3rd person • Early head-mounted displays were uncomfortable to wear, and can cause motion sickness and disorientation • Lighter VR headsets now available (e.g. HTC Vive) with more accurate head tracking www.id-book.com Application areas • Video games • Arcade games for social groups • Therapy for fears • Experience how others feel emotions – e.g. empathy and compassion • Enrich user’s planning experience for travel destinations • Architecture, design, and education www.id-book.com Polygon graphics used to represent avatars for the We Wait VR experience www.id-book.com Steed et al., 2018 Research and design considerations • Much research on how to design safe and realistic VRs to facilitate training – e.g. flying simulators – help people overcome phobias (e.g. spiders, talking in public) • Design issues – how best to navigate through them (e.g. first versus third person) – how to control interactions and movements (e.g. use of head and body movements) – how best to interact with information (e.g. use of keypads, pointing, joystick buttons); – level of realism to aim for to engender a sense of presence www.id-book.com Website design • Early websites were largely text-based, providing hyperlinks • Concern was with how best to structure information to enable users to navigate and access it easily and quickly • Nowadays, more emphasis on making pages distinctive, striking, and aesthetically pleasing • Need to think of how to design information for multi- platforms - keyboard or touch? – e.g. smartphones, tablets, PCs www.id-book.com Usability versus aesthetics? • Vanilla or multi-flavor design? – ease of finding something versus aesthetic and enjoyable experience • Web designers are: – “thinking great literature” • Users read the web like a: – “billboard going by at 60 miles an hour” (Krug, 2014) • Need to determine how to brand a web page to catch and keep ‘eyeballs’ www.id-book.com Breadcrumbs for navigation www.id-book.com • Breadcrumbs are category labels – Enable users to look at other pages without losing track of where they have come from – Very usable – Enable once-click access to higher site levels – Attract first time visitors to continue to browse a website having viewed the landing page In your face Web ads • Web advertising is often intrusive and pervasive • Flashing, aggressive, persistent, annoying • Often need to be ‘actioned’ to get rid of • What is the alternative? – Use ad blockers www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Many books and guidelines on website design • Veen’s (2001) 3 core questions to consider when designing any website: (1) Where am I? (2) Where can I go? (3) What’s here? www.id-book.com Activity • Look at a fashion brand’s website, e.g. Nike.com • What kind of website is it? • How does it contravene the design principles outlined by Veen? • Does it matter? • What kind of user experience is it providing for? • What was your experience of engaging with it? www.id-book.com Mobile interfaces • Handheld devices intended to be used while on the move • Have become pervasive, increasingly used in all aspects of everyday and working life – e.g. Phones, fitness trackers, watches • Larger sized tablets used in mobile settings – e.g. flight attendants, marketing professionals, car rental returns www.id-book.com iBeer app www.id-book.com QR codes and smartphones www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Mobile interfaces can be cumbersome to use for those with poor manual dexterity or ‘fat’ fingers • Key concern is hit area – area on the phone display that the user touches to make something happen, such as a key, an icon, a button or an app – space needs to be big enough for all fingers to accurately press – if too small the user may accidentally press the wrong key – Fitts’ Law can be used to help design right spacing • Minimum tappable areas should be 44pts x 44pts for all controls www.id-book.com Appliances • Everyday devices in home, public place, or car – e.g. washing machines, remotes, toasters, printers and navigation systems) • And personal devices – e.g. digital clock and digital camera • Used for short periods – e.g. putting the washing on, watching a program, buying a ticket, changing the time, taking a snapshot • Need to be usable with minimal, if any, learning www.id-book.com Simple toaster control www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Need to design as transient interfaces with short interactions • Simple interfaces • Consider trade-off between soft and hard controls – e.g. use of buttons or keys, dials or scrolling www.id-book.com Voice User Interfaces • Involves a person talking with a spoken language app, e.g. timetable, travel planner, phone service • Used most for inquiring about specific information, e.g. flight times or to perform a transaction, e.g. buy a ticket • Also used by people with visual impairments – e.g. speech recognition word processors, page scanners, web readers, home control systems www.id-book.com Have speech interfaces come of age? www.id-book.com Modeling human conversations • People often interrupt each other in a conversation – especially the case when ordering in a restaurant – rather than let the waiter go through all the options • Speech technology has a similar feature called ‘barge-in’ – Users can choose an option before the system will has finished listing all the options available www.id-book.com Structuring VUI dialogs • Directed dialogs are where the system is in control of the conversation – Where it asks specific questions and requires specific responses • More flexible systems allow the user to take the initiative: e.g. “I’d like to go to Paris next Monday for two weeks.” • But more chance of error, since caller might assume that the system is like a human • Guided prompts can help callers back on track – e.g. “Sorry I did not get all that. Did you say you wanted to fly next Monday?” www.id-book.com Voice assistants (e.g. Alexa) • Have become popular in many homes • Allow all to use rather than being single use • Support families playing games, interactive storytelling, jokes, etc., • Can encourage social and emotional bonding • But young children (under 4) find it difficult to be understood by the voice assistants – frustrating for them www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • How to design systems that can keep conversation on track – help people navigate efficiently through a menu system – enable them to easily recover from errors – guide those who are vague or ambiguous in their requests for information or services • Type of voice actor (e.g. male, female, neutral, or dialect) – do people prefer to listen to and are more patient with a female or male voice, a northern or southern accent? www.id-book.com Pen-based devices • Enable people to write, draw, select, and move objects at an interface using light pens or styluses – capitalize on the well-honed drawing skills developed from childhood • Digital ink, e.g. Anoto, use a combination of ordinary ink pen with digital camera that digitally records everything written with the pen on special paper www.id-book.com The Anoto pen being used and its internal components www.id-book.com Advantages • Allows users to quickly and easily annotate existing documents • Can be used to fill in paper-based forms that can readily be convert to a digital record using standard typeface • Can be used by remote teams to communicate about and work on the same documents www.id-book.com Touchscreens • Single touchscreens are used in walk-up kiosks (such as ticket machines and ATMs) detect the presence and location of a person’s touch on the display • Multi-touch surfaces support a range of more dynamic finger tip actions, e.g. swiping, flicking, pinching, pushing and tapping • They do so by registering touches at multiple locations using a grid • Now used for many kinds of displays, such as Smartphones, iPods, tablets and tabletops – supports one and two hand gestures, including tapping, zooming, stretching, flicking, dwelling, dragging www.id-book.com A multi-touch surface www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Provides fluid and direct styles of interaction involving freehand and pen-based gestures for certain tasks • Core design concerns include whether size, orientation, and shape of touch displays effect collaboration • Much faster to scroll through wheels, carousels and bars of thumbnail images or lists of options by finger flicking • Gestures need to be learned for multi-touch so small set of gestures for common commands is preferable • More cumbersome, error-prone and slower to type using a virtual keyboard on a touch display than using a physical keyboard www.id-book.com Gesture-based systems • Gestures involve moving arms and hands to communicate • Uses camera recognition, sensor and computer vision techniques – recognize people’s arm and hand gestures in a room – gestures need to be presented sequentially to be understood (cf. the way sentences are constructed) www.id-book.com Gestures used in the operating theater www.id-book.com Recognizes core gestures for manipulating MRI or CT images using Microsoft Kinect Research and design considerations • How does computer recognize and delineate user’s gestures? – Start and end points? – Difference between deictic and hand waving • How realistic must the mirrored graphical representation of the user be in order for them to be believable? www.id-book.com Haptic interfaces • Provide tactile feedback – By applying vibration and forces to a person’s body, using actuators that are embedded in their clothing or a device they are carrying, such as a smartphone • Vibrotactile feedback can be used to simulate the sense of touch between remote people who want to communicate • Ultrahaptics creates the illusion of touch in midair using ultrasound to make the illusion of 3D shapes www.id-book.com Realtime vibrotactile feedback • Provides nudges when playing violin incorrectly • Uses motion capture to sense arm movements that deviate from model • Nudges are short vibrations on arms and hands www.id-book.com Exoskeleton with artificial muscles that uses bubble haptic feedback www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Where best to place actuators on body • Whether to use single or sequence of ‘touches’ • When to buzz and how intense • How does the wearer feel it in different contexts? • What kind of new smartphones/smartwatches apps can use vibrotactile creatively? – e.g. slow tapping to feel like water dropping that is meant to indicate it is about to rain and heavy tapping to indicate a thunderstorm is looming www.id-book.com Multimodal Interfaces • Provide enriched user experiences – by multiplying how information is experienced and detected using different modalities, i.e. touch, sight, sound, speech – support more flexible, efficient, and expressive means of human–computer interaction – most common is speech and vision • Can be combined with multi-sensor input to enable other aspects of human body to be tracked – e.g. eye gaze, facial expression, lip movements – Provides input for customizing user interfaces www.id-book.com Tracking a person’s movements www.id-book.com - Kinect camera can detect multimodal input in real time, using RGA camera for facial recognition and gestures, depth camera for movement tracking and mics for voice recognition - Used to build model of person and represented as avatar on display programmed to move just like them Research and design considerations • Need to recognize and analyse user behavior, e.g. speech, gesture, handwriting, eye gaze • Much harder to calibrate these than single modality systems • What is gained from combining different input and outputs • Is talking and gesturing, as humans do with other humans, a natural way of interacting with a computer? www.id-book.com Shareable interfaces • Designed for more than one person to use – provide multiple inputs and sometimes allow simultaneous input by co-located groups – large wall displays where people use their own pens or gestures – interactive tabletops where small groups interact with information using their fingertips e.g. DiamondTouch, Smart Table and Surface www.id-book.com A smartboard and an interactive Tabletop interface www.id-book.com Benefits • Provide a large interactional space that can support flexible group working • Can be used by multiple users – Can point to and touch information being displayed – Simultaneously view the interactions and have same shared point of reference as others • Can support more equitable participation compared with groups using single PC www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Core design concerns include whether size, orientation, and shape of the display have an effect on collaboration • Horizontal surfaces compared with vertical ones support more turn-taking and collaborative working in co-located groups • Providing larger-sized tabletops does not improve group working but encourages more division of labor • Having both personal and shared spaces enables groups to work on their own and in a group – Cross device systems have been developed to support seamless switching between these – e.g. SurfaceConstellations www.id-book.com Tangible Interfaces • Type of sensor-based interaction, where physical objects, e.g., bricks, are coupled with digital representations • When a person manipulates the physical object/s it causes a digital effect to occur, e.g. an animation • Digital effects can take place in a number of media and places or can be embedded in the physical object www.id-book.com Examples • Flow Blocks – depict changing numbers and lights embedded in the blocks – vary depending on how they are connected together • Urp – physical models of buildings moved around on tabletop – used in combination with tokens for wind and shadows -> digital shadows surrounding them to change over time • MagicCubes – Connect physical electronic components and sensors to make digital events occur (e.g. change color depending on how much shaken) www.id-book.com Learning to code and create with the tangible MagicCubes www.id-book.com Benefits • Can be held in one or both hands and combined and manipulated in ways not possible using other interfaces – allows for more than one person to explore the interface together – objects can be placed on top of each other, beside each other, and inside each other – encourages different ways of representing and exploring a problem space • People are able to see and understand situations differently – can lead to greater insight, learning, and problem-solving than with other kinds of interfaces – can facilitate creativity and reflection www.id-book.com VoxBox • A tangible system that gathers opinions at events through playful and engaging interaction (Goldsteijn et al, 2015) www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • What kinds of conceptual frameworks to use to help identify novel and specific features • What kind of coupling to use between the physical action and digital effect – If it is to support learning then an explicit mapping between action and effect is critical – If it is for entertainment then can be better to design it to be more implicit and unexpected • What kind of physical artifact to use – Bricks, cubes, and other component sets are most commonly used because of flexibility and simplicity – Stickies and cardboard tokens can also be used for placing material onto a surface • What kinds of digital outputs should tangible interfaces be combined with? www.id-book.com Augmented Reality • Augmented reality - virtual representations are superimposed on physical devices and objects • Pokémon Go introduced made it a household game – Used smartphone camera and GPS to place virtual characters onto objects in the environment as if they really are there • Many other applications including medicine, navigation, air traffic control, games, and everyday exploring www.id-book.com Other examples • In medicine – virtual objects, e.g. X-rays and scans, are overlaid on part of a patient’s body – aid the physician’s understanding of what is being examined or operated • In air traffic control – dynamic information about aircraft overlaid on a video screen showing the real planes, etc. landing, taking off, and taxiing – helps identify planes difficult to make out www.id-book.com Augmented reality overlay on a car windshield www.id-book.com AR that uses forward facing camera • Enables virtual try-ons (e.g. Snapchat filters) • AT mirrors set up in retail stores for trying on make-up, sunglasses, jewellery – convenient, engaging, and easy to compare more choices – but cannot feel the weight, texture, smell of what is being tried on • Can be used to enable users to step into a character (e.g. David Bowie, Queen Victoria) www.id-book.com Singers trying on the virtual look of two characters from the opera Akhnaten www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • What kind of digital augmentation? – When and where in physical environment? – Needs to stand out but not distract from ongoing task – Need to be able to align with real world objects – What happens if the AR is slightly off? • What kind of device? – Smartphone, tablet, head up display or other? www.id-book.com Wearables • First developments were head- and eyewear-mounted cameras that enabled user to record what was seen and to access digital information • Since then, jewellery, head-mounted caps, smart fabrics, glasses, shoes, and jackets have all been used – provide the user with a means of interacting with digital information while on the move • Applications include automatic diaries, tour guides, cycle indicators and fashion clothing www.id-book.com Google Glass (2014) • Why was there so much excitement and concern about people filming what they could see in front of them? www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • Comfort – needs to be light, small, not get in the way, fashionable, and preferably hidden in the clothing • Hygiene – is it possible to wash or clean the clothing once worn? • Ease of wear – how easy is it to remove the electronic gadgetry and replace it? • Usability – how does the user control the devices that are embedded in the clothing? www.id-book.com Robots Main types – remote robots used in hazardous settings • can be controlled to investigate bombs and other dangerous materials – domestic robots helping around the house • Can pick up objects, do daily chores like vacuuming – pet robots as human companions • have therapeutic qualities, helping to reduce stress and loneliness – sociable robots that work collaboratively with humans • encourage social behaviors www.id-book.com Social robots: Mel and Paro • Cute and cuddly • Can open and close eyes, make sounds and movements www.id-book.com Drones • Unmanned aircraft that are controlled remotely and used in a number of contexts – e.g. entertainment, such as carrying drinks and food to people at festivals and parties – agricultural applications, such as flying them over vineyards and fields to collect data about crops that is useful to farmers – helping to track poachers in wildlife parks in Africa • Can fly low and and stream photos to a ground station, where images can be stitched together into maps • Can be used to determine the health of a crop or when it is the best time to harvest the crop www.id-book.com Drone being used to survey the state of a vineyard www.id-book.com Research and design considerations • How do humans react to physical robots designed to exhibit behaviors (e.g. making facial expressions) compared with virtual ones? • Should robots be designed to be human-like or look like and behave like robots that serve a clearly defined purpose? • Should the interaction be designed to enable people to interact with the robot as if it was another human being or more human-computer-like (e.g. pressing buttons to issue commands)? • Is it acceptable to use unmanned drones to take a series of images or videos of fields, towns, and private property without permission or people knowing what is happening? www.id-book.com Brain-computer interfaces • Brain–computer interfaces (BCI) provide a communication pathway between a person’s brain waves and an external device, such as a cursor on a screen • Person is trained to concentrate on the task, e.g. moving the cursor • BCIs work through detecting changes in the neural functioning in the brain • BCIs apps: – games (e.g. brain ball) – enable people who are paralysed to control robots www.id-book.com A brain-computer interface being used by a woman who is paralyzed to select letters on the screen www.id-book.com Smart interfaces • Smart: phones, speakers, watches, cars, buildings, cites • Smart refers to having some intelligence and connected to the internet and other devices • Context-aware – understand what is happening around them and execute appropriate actions, e.g. Nest thermostat • Human-building interaction – buildings are designed to sense and act on behalf of the inhabitants but also allow them tohave some control and interaction with the automated systems www.id-book.com Which interface? • Which interface to use will depend on task, users, context, cost, robustness, etc. • Is multimedia better than tangible interfaces for learning? • Is speech as effective as a command-based interface? • Is a multimodal interface more effective than a mono-modal interface? • Will wearable interfaces be better than mobile interfaces for helping people find information in foreign cities? • Are virtual environments the ultimate interface for playing games? • Are shareable interfaces be better at supporting communication and collaboration compared with using networked desktop PCs? www.id-book.com Summary • Many innovative interfaces have emerged in last 30 years, including speech, wearable, mobile, brain and tangible • Raises many design and research questions as to decide which to use – e.g. how best to represent information to the user so they can carry out ongoing activity or task • New smart interfaces that are context-aware and monitor people – raising new ethical issues concerned with what data is being collected and what it is used for www.id-book.com","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
