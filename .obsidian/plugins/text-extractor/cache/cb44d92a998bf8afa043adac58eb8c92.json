Users need both a valid account and the CREATE SESSION privilege. In addition, account management and security concepts are discussed. Strategies to simplify privilege administration are presented in terms of roles. Students must have the CREATE USER privilege to create the user accounts in this chapter. In addition, students must have been granted CREATE SESSION privilege with the WITH ADMIN OPTION to grant this privilege to new accounts. To create the role examples, the students will need the CREATE ROLE system privilege. Chapter Objectives After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following: ♦ Explain the concept of data security ♦ Create a new user account ♦ Identify two types of privileges: system and object ♦ Grant privileges to a user ♦ Address password expiration requirements ♦ Change the password of an existing account ♦ Create a role ♦ Grant privileges to a role ♦ Assign a user to a role ♦ View privilege information ♦ Revoke privileges from a user and a role ♦ Remove a user and roles Instructor Notes If you issue student Oracle accounts on a school server, assigning users account creation privileges may not be an option. Please review the Instructor’s Setup Guide provided in the Instructor Downloads area for suggestions in providing students limited access enabling experimentation with much of the chapter content. Data Security Recent events have caused more attention to be focused in the areas of cyberterrorism and the need for network security. Due to the type of detailed personal information contained in the databases of government and business organizations, organizations are expected, even required, Oracle 12c: SQL 7-3 to protect this information. It is not uncommon for a company whose database has been illegally accessed to be sued for negligence due to lack of proper security measures. Oracle 12c supports various levels of security, especially for verifying user identity, including support for third-party biometric devices. Quick Quiz 1. What is the purpose of authentication? ANSWER: To ensure that users are who they claim they are 2. Why is authentication necessary? ANSWER: To protect the data contained in the database 3. What is a standard authentication procedure used by most organizations before access to the database is allowed? ANSWER: A valid user name and password 4. What term is used to describe individuals who gain illegal access to a system? ANSWER: Hackers Creating a User When a user account is created, a password must be assigned. It is preferable to immediately expire the password, which will force the user to change the DBA assigned password as soon as the user first successfully connects to the database. Although a user may have a valid user account, this does not imply that user will be to access the database. Privileges will still be required, even with a valid account. Troubleshooting Tip Have the students create a user account and then attempt to connect to the database to demonstrate the need for the CREATE SESSION privilege. Oracle 12c: SQL 7-4 Quick Quiz 1. What clause is used with the CREATE USER command to specify a password for the user? ANSWER: IDENTIFIED BY 2. How can a user disconnect and reconnect to an Oracle database in one step? ANSWER: Use the CONNECT command 3. What is the maximum number of characters for a user name? ANSWER: 30 4. Does having a valid user account allow a user to connect to a database? ANSWER: No, the correct privilege must be assigned. 5. What symbols can be included in a user name? ANSWER: Underscore, dollar sign, and number sign Assigning User Privileges There are two categories of privileges: object and system privileges. Although the GRANT command is used to assign both types of privileges, they cannot be included in the same GRANT command because object privileges require use of the ON clause. A user will automatically have all privileges associated with objects he or she created. Troubleshooting Tip Remind students that the ADMIN keyword is associated with system privileges, whereas the GRANT keyword is associated with object privileges, and that a cascade effect can occur when revoking object privileges. Oracle 12c: SQL 7-5 Quick Quiz 1. What is the difference between system privileges and object privileges? ANSWER: Object privileges are granted on specific objects, whereas system privileges apply across the entire database. 2. Which type of privilege is the WITH ADMIN OPTION used with? ANSWER: System privileges 3. What does the ALL keyword specify? ANSWER: That all privileges of that type (system or object) are being granted to the indicated user(s) 4. What does the PUBLIC keyword specify? ANSWER: That the specified privilege(s) is granted to all users 5. Which privilege is required for a user to connect to a database? ANSWER: CREATE SESSION privilege Utilizing Roles Roles can be used to organize privileges granted to users. They can be organized based on the type of tasks that need to be performed by users. A default role can be established for users. However, users have the ability to enable other assigned roles when needed using the SET ROLE command. Troubleshooting Tip Demonstrate the number of steps that would be required to assign privileges to new users versus assigning the privileges via a role that has already been created. Quick Quiz 1. What is a role? ANSWER: A collection of privileges 2. Which option, the WITH ADMIN OPTION or WITH GRANT OPTION, cannot be used when a privilege is assigned to a role? ANSWER: WITH GRANT OPTION 3. How can a user be assigned a default role? ANSWER: Use the DEFAULT ROLE keywords Oracle 12c: SQL 7-6 4. Can a password be assigned to a role? ANSWER: Yes 5. How many roles can a user have enabled at a time? ANSWER: One Viewing Privilege Information Various data dictionary views can be queried to determine the privileges currently assigned to a user or role. Removing Privileges and Roles When a privilege is revoked from a user or a role, the effect is immediate and the user will no longer be able to use that privilege. However, if a role is revoked from the user and the role was enabled at the time it was revoked, the user will be able to use the privileges assigned to that role for the remainder of the current session. However, it will not be available at the time of the next session. Quick Quiz 1. What command is used to revoke a system privilege from a role? ANSWER: REVOKE 2. How can you change a user name? ANSWER: Drop the user account and create another one using the correct name 3. What command is used to delete a role? ANSWER: DROP ROLE 4. Which type of privilege could have a cascade effect on other users when it is revoked? ANSWER: An object privilege granted with the WITH GRANT OPTION 5. What command is used to remove a user from the database? ANSWER: DROP USER Discussion Questions 1. How could roles be used to simplify the administration of privileges in a large organization that consists of eight departments and a minimum of three levels of management within each department? Oracle 12c: SQL 7-7 2. Describe different roles that an insurance company might create to manage user groups. Key Terms authentication — The process of validating the identity of computer users. coding scheme — When a DBA creates a user account, the user's identity is set by using a code; the \"scheme\" of the code often consists of the user’s first initial followed by last name. Used widely in industry for part numbers, customer numbers, etc. hackers — A slang term generally applied to computer criminals who gain illegal access to information systems. object privileges — Allow users to perform DML or retrieval operations on the data contained within database objects. privileges — Allow database access to users. Oracle 12c has system privileges and object privileges. role — A group, or collection, of privileges. In most organizations, roles correlate to users' job duties. system privileges — Allow access to the Oracle 12c database and let users perform DDL operations such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP on database objects. An object privilege combined with the keyword ANY is also considered a system privilege.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
