Option 1: x1 The formula is not true in x1 because p is not true in x1 and x1 is accessible from itself. Therefore □ p is not true in x1, and therefore □ p  ◊ □ q is not true in x1. Option 2: x2 The formula is not true in x2 because p is not true in x1 and x1 is accessible from x2. Therefore □ p is not true in x2, and therefore □ p  ◊ □ q is not true in x2. Option 3: x3 The formula is not true in x3 because there is no world accessible from x3. Therefore ◊ □ q is not true in x3, and therefore □ p  ◊ □ q is not true in x3. Option 4: x4 The formula is true in x4 because p is true in all worlds accessible from x4, namely x2 and x3. Therefore □ p is true in x4. Furthermore, x2 is accessible from x4 and □ q is true in x2 (because q is true in all worlds accessible from x2), so ◊ □ q is true in x4, and therefore □ p  ◊ □ q is true in x4. Option 5: The formula is not true in any world of the Kripke model. See explanation of Option 4. QUESTION 2 3 COS3761/203/1 Which of the following holds in the Kripke model given in Figure 1? Option 1: x1 ╟ □ p p is not true in x1, and since x1 is accessible from itself, □ p is not true in x1. Option 2: x2 ╟ □ (p  q) p  q is not true in x1, and since x1 is accessible from x2, □ (p  q) is not true in x2. Option 3: x3 ╟ □ p  ◊ q □ p is vacuously true in x3 since there are no worlds accessible from x3, but ◊ q is not true in x3 for the same reason. Option 4: x3 ╟ □ □ ¬ p □ □ ¬ p is vacuously true in x3 since there are no worlds accessible from x3. Option 5: x4 ╟ p  q p  q is not true in x4 since p is true and q is false in x4. QUESTION 3 Which of the following does not hold in the Kripke model given in Figure 1? Option 1: x1 ╟ ◊ q ◊ q holds in x1 because q is true in at least one world accessible from x1, namely x1. Option 2: x1 ╟ □ (p  q) □ (p  q) holds in x1 because p  q is true in all worlds accessible from x1, namely x1, x2 and x4. Option 3: x2 ╟ ◊ p  □ q ◊ p  □ q holds in x2 because ◊ p is true in x2 (because p is true in at least one world accessible from x2, namely x2) and □ q is true in x2 (because q is true in all worlds accessible from x2, namely x1 and x3). Option 4: x3 ╟ □ (p  ¬ q) □ (p  ¬ q) holds in x3 because p  ¬ q is vacuously true in all worlds accessible from x3, since there aren't any such worlds. Option 5: x4 ╟ □ (p  q) □ (p  q) does not hold in x4 because p  q is not true in all worlds accessible from x4, namely x2 and x3 (because p is true and q is false in x2 and so p  q is false in x2). QUESTION 4 Which of the following formulas is true in the Kripke model given in Figure 1? 4 Option 1: ◊ p ◊ p is not true in x3 since there are no worlds accessible from x3. Since ◊ p is not true in one of the worlds of the Kripke model, it is not true in the whole Kripke model. Option 2: □ q □ q is not true in x1 because q is not true in all worlds accessible from x1. So □ q is not true in the Kripke model. Option 3: □ ◊ q □ ◊ q is not true in x2 (and x4) because x3 is one of the worlds accessible from it and ◊ q is not true in x3. So □ ◊ q is not true in the Kripke model. Option 4: □ (p  q) p  q is true in every world of the Kripke model, so it is true in any world accessible from every world, so it is true in the Kripke model. Option 5: q  p q  p is not true in x1 because q is true and p is false in x1. So q  p is not true in the Kripke model. QUESTION 5 Which of the following formulas is false in the Kripke model given in Figure 1? Option 1: p  q p  q is true in every world of the Kripke model, so it is true in the Kripke model. Option 2: □ ◊ p □ ◊ p is not true in x2 since ◊ p is not true in all worlds accessible from x2. In particular, ◊ p is not true in x3 since there are no worlds accessible from x3. Option 3: □ (p  q) p  q is true in every world of the Kripke model, so it is true in any world accessible from every world, so it is true in the Kripke model. Option 4: p  ◊ q p is true in worlds x2, x3 and x4, and ◊ q is true in x1, so p  ◊ q is true in all worlds of the Kripke model. Option 5: □ p  ◊ q □ p is true in worlds x3 and x4 (since p is true in all worlds accessible from x3 and x4) and ◊ q is true in worlds x1 and x2 (since x1 and x2 each have a world accessible from them in which q is true). QUESTION 6 If we interpret □  as \"It ought to be that  \", which of the following formulas correctly expresses the English sentence It ought to be that if I am happy, I'm allowed to be unhappy. where p stands for the declarative sentence \"I am happy\"? COS3761/203/1 5 Option 1: □ p  ◊ ¬ p This formula states \"If I ought to be happy, then I am allowed to be unhappy\", which is not the same as the declarative sentence. Option 2: ◊ ¬ p  ¬ □ p This formula is equivalent to ¬ ◊ ¬ p  ¬ □ p, which is equivalent to □ p  ¬ □ p, which states that \"If I ought to be happy, then I ought not to be happy\", which is not the same as the declarative sentence. Option 3: □ (p  ¬ □ p) ¬ □ p is the same as ¬ ¬ ◊ ¬ p which is the same as ◊ ¬ p. So the formula correctly expresses the sentence. Option 4: □ (p  ¬ ◊ p) This formula states \"It ought to be the case that if I am happy, then I am not allowed to be happy\", which is not the same as the declarative sentence. Option 5: It is impossible to translate this sentence into a formula of modal logic with the required interpretation. See comment on Option 3. QUESTION 7 If we interpret □  as \"It is necessarily true that  \", why should the formula scheme □    hold in this modality? Option 1: Because for all formulas , it is necessarily true that if  then . This explanation does not correctly express the formula scheme. It represents the formula □ (  ). Option 2: Because for all formulas , if  is necessarily true, then it is true. This explanation makes common sense. Option 3: Because for all formulas , if  is not possibly true, then it is true. This explanation represents the formula ¬ ◊   , which is equivalent to ¬ ¬ □ ¬   , which is equivalent to □ ¬   . This is not the same as the given formula scheme. Option 4: Because for all formulas ,  is necessarily true if it is true. This explanation represents the formula which is equivalent to   □ , which is not the same as the given formula scheme. Option 5: □    should not hold in this modality. Yes it should. See Table 5.7 in the prescribed book. 6 QUESTION 8 If we interpret □  as \"After any execution of program P,  holds\", why should the formula scheme □    not hold in this modality? Option 1: Just because  holds after every execution of P doesn't necessarily mean that  holds before execution of P. The formula scheme states \"If  holds after any execution of program P, then  holds\". The explanation follows from the common sense meaning of this sentence, which is incorrect. Option 2: Because it is not the case that after any execution of P, if  holds then  holds. This explanation expresses the formula scheme □ (  ) which is not the same as the given formula scheme. Option 3: Because if  does not hold before execution of P, it doesn't necessarily mean that  holds after any execution of P. This explanation expresses the formula scheme   □  which is not the same as the given formula scheme. Option 4: Because if  does not hold after every execution of P, it doesn't necessarily mean that  holds before any execution of P. This explanation expresses the formula scheme ¬ □    . Although it may be correct that this should not hold in this modality, this formula scheme is not the same as the given formula scheme. Option 5: □    should hold in this modality, because if  holds after any execution of P, then  holds. This is not correct, because say  represents the assertion that \"Hello world is displayed on the screen.\" Then just because  holds after program P is executed, doesn't mean that Hello world is always displayed on the screen (particularly before P is executed). QUESTION 9 If we interpret □  as \"Always in the future (where the future does not include the present) it will be true that  \", which of the following formulas should not be valid? COS3761/203/1 7 Option 1: □ p  □ □ p This formula should be valid, because it states that if p will always be true in the future, then in the future, p will always be true in the future. Option 2: ¬ □ p  ¬ ◊ ◊ ¬ p This formula is equivalent to □ p  □ □ p, because ¬ ◊ ¬  is the same as □ , and ¬ 1  2 is equivalent to 1  2. So it should be valid according to the argument given for Option 1. Option 3: ¬ ◊ ¬ p  □ p This formula should be valid because it is equivalent to □ p  □ p. Option 4: ¬ □ □ p  ◊ ¬ p This formula is equivalent to ¬ □ □ p  ¬ □ ¬ ¬ p, which is equivalent to □ p  □ □ p. So it should be valid according to the argument given for Option 1. Option 5: □ □ p  ¬ □ p This formula is equivalent to □ p  □ □ p, so it should be valid according to the argument given for Option 1. Please note that Question 9 was not marked, because the formulas in all the options are valid, and there is no invalid formula. QUESTION 10 If we interpret □  as \"Agent A believes  \", what is the English translation of the formula □ p  ¬ ◊ q? Option 1: If Agent A believes p, then Agent B does not believe q. ◊ q does not refer to Agent B. It can be expressed as \"q is consistent with Agent A's beliefs\". Option 2: Agent A believes that if p, then q is not consistent with Agent A's beliefs. This explanation expresses the formula □ (p  ¬ ◊ q) which is not the same as the given formula. Option 3: Agent A believes that if p, then Agent B does not believe q. See comment on Option 1. Option 4: If Agent A believes p, then Agent A believes not q. This explanation expresses the formula □ p  □ ¬ q which is the same as the given formula due to the duality of □ and ◊. Option 5: Agent A believes p if Agent A believes not q. This explanation expresses the formula □ ¬ q  □ p which is the converse of the given formula. QUESTION 11 If we interpret □  as \"Agent A believes  \", what formula will be correctly translated to English as Agent A does not believe p or q. 8 Option 1: ◊ ¬ (p  q) This formula is equivalent to ¬ □ (p  q), which is correctly translated to English as the given sentence. Option 2: □ ¬ (p  q) The translation of this formula is \"Agent A believes that p or q is not true.\" This is not the same as the given sentence. Option 3: ¬ □ p  q The translation of this formula is \"Agent A does not believe p, or q is true.\" This is not the same as the given sentence. Option 4: ◊ ¬ p  q This formula is equivalent to ¬ □ p  q due to the duality of □ and ◊. See comment on Option 3. Option 5: □ ¬ p  □ ¬ q This formula is equivalent to □ (¬ p  ¬ q) due to equivalences 5.3 on page 314 of the prescribed book, which is equivalent to □ ¬ (p  q) due to De Morgan's rule. See comment on Option 2. QUESTION 12 Consider the following Kripke frame: x1 x2 x3 x4 Which of the following modal logics does this frame conform to? Option 1: KT The relation is not reflexive because not all worlds are accessible from themselves, in particular x4. Option 2: KB The relation is not symmetric, because not all pairs of worlds are mutually accessible. For example, x2 is accessible from x1, but x1 is not accessible from x2. Option 3: KD The relation is not serial, because not every world has a world which is accessible from it, in particular x4. Option 4: K4 The relation is transitive, because for all pairs of worlds xi and xk such that there is an xj such that xj is accessible from xi, and xk is accessible from xj, then xk is accessible from xi. Option 5: KT45 The relation is not functional because every world is not accessible by a maximum of one other world. For example, x3 is accessible from three worlds, namely x1, x2 and x3. COS3761/203/1 9 The following natural deduction proof (without reasons) is referred to in Questions 13, 14 and 15: 1 □ (p  q) 2 p  q 3 p 4 q 5 □ p 6 □ q 7 □ p  □ q 8 □ (p  q)  (□ p  □ q) QUESTION 13 How many times are □ elimination and introduction rules used in the above proof? Option 1: None See comment on Option 3. Option 2: □ elimination and □ introduction are both only used once. See comment on Option 3. Option 3: □ elimination is used only once but □ introduction twice. □ elimination is used in line 2, and □ introduction is used in lines 5 and 6. □ elimination always occur somewhere inside a dashed box, □ and introduction always occurs somewhere after a dashed box. Option 4: □ elimination is used twice but □ introduction only once. See comment on Option 3. Option 5: □ elimination and □ introduction are both used twice. See comment on Option 3. QUESTION 14 What is the correct reason for steps 1, 2 and 3 of the above proof? 10 Option 1: 1 2 3 assumption axiom T in line 1 e 2 Although line 1 is an assumption, line 2 is inside a dashed box, so it utilises □ elimination, not axiom T. Option 2: 1 2 3 premise □i 1 □e 2 The first line in a solid box is always an assumption. Option 3: 1 2 3 premise assumption i 2 The first line in a solid box is always an assumption. Option 4: 1 2 3 □i 1 axiom T in line 2 i 3,4 The first line in a solid box is always an assumption. Option 5: 1 2 3 assumption □e 1 e 2 The first formula inside a (solid) box is always an assumption, so the reason for line 1 is correct. Line 2 is inside a dashed box, so this is the application of □ elimination. Line 3 is indeed an application of  elimination applied to line 2. QUESTION 15 What sequent is proved by the above proof? Option 1: □ (p  q) □ (p  q)  (□ p  □ q) There are no premises in the sequent because there are no assumptions outside of boxes in the proof. Option 2: □ (p  q) □ p  □ q If the final step was omitted, as well as the box around lines 1 to 7, then this would be a valid sequent for the proof. Option 3: □ (p  q)  (□ p  □ q) Since □ (p  q) is an assumption, and □ p  □ q is proved in consequence inside the same box, we can use  introduction to prove □ (p  q)  (□ p  □ q) outside the box. Since no other assumptions outside the box were used, there are no premises of the sequent. Option 4: □ p  □ q □ p  □ q is proved on the basis of the assumption □ (p  q), so it is not a valid sequent on its own. Option 5: It's impossible to say without the reasons. This is incorrect because you can fill in the reasons first. COS3761/203/1 11 The following incomplete natural deduction proof is referred to in Questions 16 and 17: 1 □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p assumption 2 3 ¬ □ p assumption 4 5  ¬e 2,4 6 □ p PBC 3-5 7 8 □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p  □ □ p i 1-7 QUESTION 16 Rules T, 4 and 5 are used in the missing lines of the above proof. Which rule is used in which line? Option 1: Rule T is used in line 2, rule 4 is used in line 4 and rule 5 is used in line 7. If we use rule T in line 2, we will get a negated formula. We can only use rule 4 on a positive formula, so the only valid application would be on line 1 to produce □ □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p. Similarly, we can only use rule 5 on a negated formula, so the only valid applications would be on lines 2 or 3 to produce □ ¬□ ¬ □ p or □ ¬ □ p. Neither of these options would make step 8 correct. Option 2: Rule 4 is used in line 2, rule 5 is used in line 4 and rule T is used in line 7. If rule 4 is applied in line 2, it will produce the formula □ □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p. To be able to use ¬e 2,4 in line 5, the formula in line 4 would have to be ¬ □ □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p. Using rule 5 in line 4 cannot produce this. Option 3: Rule T is used in line 2, rule 5 is used in line 4 and rule 4 is used in line 7. Since ¬e 2,4 is used in line 5, the formulas in lines 2 and 4 must be the complements of one another. We therefore need to use rule T in line 2 to strip a box from the formula in line 1, and rule 5 in line 4 to add a box to the formula in line 3. Finally, we need to use rule 4 in line 7 to add a box to the formula in line 6. Option 4: Rule 5 is used in line 2, rule T is used in line 4 and rule 4 is used in line 7. Rule 5 cannot be used in line 2 because the only line it can be applied to is line 1, and the formula in line 1 is not a negated formula. Option 5: Rule 4 is used in line 2, rule T is used in line 4 and rule 5 is used in line 7. If rule 4 is applied in line 2, it will produce the formula □ □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p. To be able to use ¬e 2,4 in line 5, the formula in line 4 would have to be ¬ □ □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p. Using rule T in line 4 cannot produce this. QUESTION 17 What formulas belong in the missing lines of the above proof? 12 Option 1: ¬ □ ¬ □ p in line 2, □ ¬ □ p in line 4 and □ □ p in line 7 Option 2: □ □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p in line 2, □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p in line 4 and □ □ p in line 7 Option 3: ¬ □ ¬ □ p in line 2, ¬ □ ¬ □ p in line 4 and p in line 7 Option 4: □ □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p in line 2, ¬ □ ¬ □ p in line 4 and p in line 7 Option 5: □ ¬ □ p in line 2, ¬ □ ¬ □ p in line 4 and □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p  □ □ p in line 7 The fact that ¬e 2,4 is used in line 5 means that the formulas in lines 2 and 4 must be the complements of one another. This immediately eliminates options 2, 3 and 4. It would be meaningless to use the formula □ ¬ □ ¬ □ p  □ □ p in line 7, as in option 5, since step 8 would be redundant (and incorrect). The formulas given in option 1, together with the reasons of option 1 of Question 16, will give a correct proof. QUESTION 18 What proof strategy would you use to prove the following sequent: ├ KT4 □ □ (p  q)  (□ p  □ q) Option 1:  Open a solid box and start with □ □ (p  q) as an assumption.  Use axiom T to remove one □.  Open a dashed box and use □ elimination to get p  q.  Use  elimination twice to obtain the separate atomic formulas.  Close the dashed box and use □ introduction twice, i.e. once on each of the atomic formulas.  Combine □ p and □ q using  introduction.  Close the solid box and use  introduction on the first and last formulas to get the result. You can confirm that this is a correct proof strategy by writing out the proof, following the instructions step by step. COS3761/203/1 13 Option 2:  Start with □ □ (p  q) as a premise.  Use axiom T twice to remove both □ to get p  q.  Use  elimination once to obtain the separate atomic formulas.  Use axiom 4 twice, i.e. once on each atomic formula to add a □.  Combine □ p and □ q using  introduction.  Use  introduction on the first and last formulas to get the result. The final step of this proof strategy is incorrect, as you can only use  i outside a solid box that starts with the antecedent and ends with the consequent. Furthermore, when you start with a premise, then the sequent which you are proving should have that formula to the left of the turnstile. Option 3:  Start with □ □ (p  q) as a premise.  Open a dashed box and use □ elimination to get □ (p  q).  Open another dashed box and use □ elimination to get p  q.  Use  elimination twice to obtain the separate atomic formulas.  Close the first dashed box and use □ introduction on the first atomic formula.  Close the second dashed box and use □ introduction on the second atomic formula.  Combine □ p and □ q using  introduction.  Use  introduction on the first and last formulas to get the result. See comment on Option 2. Option 4:  Open a solid box and start with □ □ (p  q) as an assumption.  Open a dashed box and use □ elimination to get □ (p  q).  Use axiom T to remove one □ to get p  q.  Use  elimination twice to obtain the separate atomic formulas.  Use axiom 4 twice, i.e. once on each atomic formula to add a □.  Close the dashed box and combine □ p and □ q using  introduction.  Close the solid box and use  introduction on the first and last formulas to get the result. The problem with this proof strategy is that it uses rule 4 to add boxes to p and q. This is not allowed. Rule 4 can only be used to add a box to a formula which already starts with a box. Option 5: This is not a valid sequent in KT4. It is, since there is a correct natural deduction proof for it. See comment on Option 1. 14 QUESTION 19 If we interpret Ki  as \"Agent i knows  \", what is the English translation of the formula K1 K2 ¬ p  q? Option 1: Agent 1 knows that agent 2 doesn't know p implies q. This explanation expresses the formula K1 ¬ K2 p  q, which is not the same as the given formula. Option 2: Agent 1 knows that agent 2 knows that not p implies q. This explanation expresses the formula K1 K2 (¬ p  q), which is not the same as the given formula. Option 3: Agent 1 knows that if agent 2 doesn't know p, then q. This explanation expresses the formula K1 (¬ K2 p  q), which is not the same as the given formula. Option 4: Agent 1 knows that if agent 2 knows not p, then q. This explanation expresses the formula K1 ((K2 ¬ p)  q), which is not the same as the given formula. Option 5: If agent 1 knows that agent 2 knows not p, then q. This explanation expresses the formula (K1 K2 ¬ p)  q, which is the same as the given formula due to the precedence of the modal operators over implication. QUESTION 20 If we interpret Ki  as \"Agent i knows  \", what formula of modal logic is correctly translated to English as Agent 1 knows p but he doesn't know that agent 2 knows q. Option 1: K1 (p  ¬ K2 q) This formula can be translated to English as follows: \"Agent 1 knows p and that agent 2 doesn't know q.\" This is not the same as the required translation. Option 2: K1 (p  K2 ¬ q) This formula can be translated to English as follows: \"Agent 1 knows p and that agent 2 knows not q.\" This is not the same as the required translation. Option 3: K1 p  ¬ K1 K2 q This formula is correctly translated to the given sentence. Option 4: K1 p  K1 ¬ K2 q This formula can be translated to English as follows: \"Agent 1 knows p and he knows that agent 2 doesn't know q.\" This is not the same as the required translation. Option 5: K1 p  K1 K2 ¬ q This formula can be translated to English as follows: \"Agent 1 knows p and he knows that agent 2 knows not q.\" This is not the same as the required translation. © UNISA 2018","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
