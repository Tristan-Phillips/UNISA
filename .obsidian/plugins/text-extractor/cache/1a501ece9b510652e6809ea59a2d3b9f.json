The exam will now be an MCQ exam. I'm scheduling 2 mock exams for tomorrow, one at 10h00, and one at 19h00. Please note the time that you want to do the test - 'm not sending out reminders. Also please only do one of the sessions. The 19h00 session is for students who are essential workers and cannot do it in the morning. I'm publishing the tests 5 minutes before the time, but you will only be able to access them 10h00/19h00 & ~ Reply","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
