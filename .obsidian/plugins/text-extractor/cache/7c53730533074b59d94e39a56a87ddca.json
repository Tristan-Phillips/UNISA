The structure for CATEGORY table should be as follows: Table name: CATEGORY Column Name Datatype Width CATCODE (Primary key) VARCHAR2 3 CATDESC (Not Null) VARCHAR2 11 Here are some data entries for the CATEGORY table: CATCODE CATDESC BUS BUSINESS CHN CHILDREN COK COOKING COM COMPUTER 2.1 Create the CATEGORY table.

Learning form the E.R diagram and the contents of the BOOKS table, the contents of the Category column are the actual names for each category of books. This structure presents a problem if one user enters COMPUTER for the Computer category and another user enters COMPUTERS. To avoid this and other problems that might occur, the database designers have decided to create a CATEGORY table containing a code (CATCODE) and description (CATDESC) for each category. The structure for CATEGORY table should be as follows: 2.1 Create the CATEGORY table. (5 marks) CREATE TABLE CATEGORY ( CATCODE VARCHAR2(3) PRIMARY KEY, CATDESC VARCHAR2(11) NOT NULL ); 2.2 Verify that the table category was successfully created and view the schema of the table. (2 marks) DESCRIBE CATEGORY; 2.3 Modify the CATDESC column from the current width of 11 characters to 20 characters.

An equijoin is a type of join that combines tables based on matching values in specified columns. ii. A self-join allows you to join a table to itself. It is useful for querying hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table. iii. An inner join displays data only if a corresponding record in each table is queries iv. An outer join links data in table that don’t have equivalent rows. Matches records existing in one table that don’t have a matching record in the other table included in the results. 2.2) 2.3) An Identity Column is particularly suited for use as primary key column values in which random or surrogate values are needed to serve as a unique id for each row. Creating an Identity Column simplifies the process of establishing and managing a primary key column for a table.  Only one Identity Column defined per table is allowed.  A DEFAULT clause cannot be assigned to the same column (an identity definition automatically creates a sequence and default setting for the column).  A NOT NULL and Unique constraint are automatically applied on a column defined as an Identity Column.  An Identity Column must use the NUMBER data type  The default setting implicitly set on a column by an Identity Column assignment will enforce an always option, so a value cannot be specified to Insert into the column.

Section B [80 marks] Question 2 [20 marks] 2.1 Explain the difference between an inner join and outer join. (1 marks) 2.2 When using joins to query a database, what is the purpose of qualifiers and when are you required to use them? (2 marks) 2.3 What are the differences between the JOIN …..USING and JOIN …..ON approaches for joining tables? (2 marks) 2.4 Based on the tables of the JustLee books database, determine the profit of each book sold to Jake Lucas using the actual price paid by the customer (not the book’s regular price). Sort the results by order date. If more than one book was ordered, sort the results by profit amount in descending order. Perform the search using customer name, not the customer number. Create the query using the keywords JOIN….USING. (10 marks) 2.5 Based on the tables of the JustLee books database, display a list of all books in the BOOKS table. If the customer has ordered a book, also list the corresponding order number and identify the State in which the customer resides. Create the query using the traditional OUTER JOIN operator. (5 marks) Question 3 [15 marks] 3.1 Based on the tables of the JustLee books database, determine the amount of total profit generated by the book purchased on order 1002. Display the book title and profit. Format the profit to display a dollar sign and two decimal places. Take into account that the customer may not pay the full retail price and each item ordered can involve multiple copies. Create the query using the the TO_CHAR and join the BOOKS and the ORDERITEMS tables. (7 marks) 3.2 Based on the tables of the JustLee books database, determine the average profit generated by the orders in the ORDERS table.

(1 mark) 5.3 Create a sequence for populating the Member_ID column of the Client _Data table. Name the sequence Client_Data_ID_Seq. Start the sequence at 101, increment the sequence by 1, have a maximum value of 5000 and do not allow caching. (5 marks) 5.4 Add the following data to the Client_Data table. Use the Client_Data_ID_Seq sequence to populate the member_id column. (5 marks) Member_id Last_name Address City Phone Join_date Brown 283 King Street Pretoria 012 429 7101 08 June 2016 5.5.

Confirm your modification by checking the description of the table. (3 marks) 5.7 Create a private synonym that enables you to reference Client_Data_ID_Seq object as CLIENTDET. (2 marks) 5.8 Create a B-tree index on the client’s Last_name column. Verify that the index exists by querying the data dictionary. Remove the index from data dictionary. (5 marks) 5.9 Scott is a newly appointed trainee in the database administration department. As the manager of the department, create the user Scott with a password that expire and give him access to your Client_Data table. Assign privileges to query and add rows to the table.

An equijoin returns only the rows that have equivalent values for the specified columns. SELF-JOIN simply is a normal join which is used to join a table to itself. INNER JOIN is a JOIN operation that allows you to specify an explicit join clause - by specifying ON with a boolean expression. OUTER JOIN A join between two tables that returns the results of the inner join as well as the unmatched rows from the left (or right) tables is called a left (or right) outer join.
