The browser's interpretation and presentation capabilities are sufficient to develop web-based applications. True False 2. Backup & recovery, system support, security auditing & monitoring, and performance auditing & monitoring are the four main areas of DBMS operations. True False 3. Database connectivity is also called database middleware simply because it interfaces between the application program and the database. True False 4. A shared lock produces no conflict as long as all the concurrent transactions are read-write only. True False 5. The SQL execution activities are performed by the query optimizer. True False 6. The scheduler establishes the order in which the operations within concurrent transactions are executed. True False 7. The data cache is where the data read from the database data files are stored before the data have been read or after the data are written to the database data files. True False 8. A fully distributed database management system (DBMS) must perform all the functions of a centralized DBMS, and it must handle all necessary functions imposed by the distribution of data and processing True False 9. The purpose of an I/0 operation is to move data to and from different computer components or devices. True False 10. The use of time stamping to manage concurrency in a multiusers database is based on the assumption that conflict between transactions are likely. True False 11. Decision Support Systems (DSS) are essential to the well-being and even survival of businesses that must compete in the global market place. True False 12. In the single-site processing, single-site data (SPSD) scenario, all processing must be done on the end user's side of the system. True False 13. To save data storage space and improves data access performance in data warehouse, fact tables have to be normalized. True False 14. Generally, data visualization makes use of characteristics such as shape, color, size, position and grouping/order to convey and highlight the meaning of data. True False 15. Data visualization is a whole new concept that only emerged with the development of Big data and business intelligence True False 16. When using the optimistic approach, during the validation phase, the transaction is validated to ensure that the changes made will not affect the integrity and consistency of the database. True False 17. Gantt chart, waterfall chart, line histogram, tables and bubble maps are techniques used for data visualization. True False 18. Validation against a data dictionary is to ensure that the table names and column names are correctly done during the execution phase of the query processing. True False 19. The data warehouse development life cycle differs from classical systems development. True False 20. Operating system independence, replication transparency and distributed query processing are among the C.J DATE’S 12 commandments for distributed databases. True False GOOD LUCK !!
