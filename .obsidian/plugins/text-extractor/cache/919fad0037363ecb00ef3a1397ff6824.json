Explain clearly why and how these differences matter (12) User Experience Goals Usability Goals Desktop Cell Phone Satisfying Helpful: As a user, I would like to feel that the product offers me help and is an aid rather than a hinderence. Effective, Utility The desktop app provides a different set of helpfulness. It helps me create spreadsheets, Letters, and presentation Helpful in making a call, messaging, setting alarms Engaging: Engagement as perceived by the user means that time flies when interacting with a device and the user has the pry themselves away from it. Closely related to flow. Learnability, memorable Can be very engaging when on when working on a problem in excel and finding a good formula to work with. Can be very engaging when messaging with a friend or on a workgroup Enjoyable: As a user I want to enjoy the product I bought. I need to derive satisfaction from using it. Effective and Efficient Very enjoyable when working with a product that works and does great things. e.g. Excel Enjoyable in that I can pick up my phone and use it any time, and at socially awkward times. Pleasurable Effective and Efficient Exciting Effective and Efficient Motivating: Motivation can come in different forms, however, a device that is easy to learn and effective to use, can motivate me to want to try more advanced features and even go as far to do training on the product. Learnabilty, Safe Memorability Excel motivates one to want to learn more about its functionality Motivates me to learn all the functionality my phone can perform. Challenging Utility INF3720 May/June 2015 MEMO Page 2 of 5 Enhancing Sociability: A device that enables a user to socialise and experience a sense of connectedness to the world provides me with the experience of being part of something bigger. Effective Facebook desktop app is lovely to use especially when wanting to comment on posts because of the use of keyboards Enhances sociability more because phones are portable. However, commenting is a long-winded process Supporting Creativity Efficient Cognitively Stimulating I experience the feeling of being rewarded when I figure out how to do something and it works. Safe Fun Memorability Provocative Efficient Surprising Efficient Excel always suprises me with new functionality that it comes up with that really support me in my job and I am always surprised at what they thought up. I am surprised at the new functionality of my phone. I can now use my phone to complete forms and send without having to download, fill in and then scan and then mail. Rewarding: It creates a rewarding feeling or when the device I purchased does what it is supposed to do. Effective and Efficiency Excel is rewarding and emotionally fulfilling desktop app. It has huge functionality. Emotionally Fulfilling Efficient, Safe These differences matter because their usability, functionality, aesthetics, their content, look and feel and sensual and emotional feel are different for each device. The users needs and goals when using these products are different. INF3720 May/June 2015 MEMO Page 3 of 5 1.2 Consider Preece et al's five design principals. For each of the five design principals 1.2.1 name and explain It briefly, and 1.2.2 also give an example of how the specific design principle can help to achieve one or more of the SIX user experience goals you have Identified in question Design Principles Feedback Feedback provide provides confirmation that the user is on the right track which is rewarding and motivating and often surprising. Visibility Visibility of the status of my friends and pictures of their lives enhances sociability and engagement as the user can see the results of their interactions. Affordance Affordance in knowing what to do next makes the experience of learning a device enjoyable Consistency The fact that an interface is design with consistency makes it very helpful in that a users knows what to expect Constraints Constraints are helpful in preventing errors 2 QUESTION 2 49 2.1 Briefly compare the use of notes, audio and video when recording usability study data [6] 2.2 Discuss and explain the differences between paradigms, theories, models and frameworks as It relates to human-computer interaction Give appropriate examples where possible Paradigm: A paradigm is general approach that has been accepted by a community of researchers or designers for carrying out their work that share the same assumptions, values, concepts and practices. e.g. How to design user-centred applications for the desktop computer. The WIMP paradigm was born out of how to design for a single user for an interface based on their cognitive abilities. Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers. We now use the GUI paradigm where designers decided along with the advancement of technology to go beyond the desktop would led to a whole new paradigm shift. INF3720 May/June 2015 MEMO Page 4 of 5 Framework: is a set of interrelated concepts/questions used to inform task domain, on-line communities or analytics. e.g. Norman’s conceptual framework in which the user uses the system in the way that the designer intended to and the system image enables the user to use the system in the way it was designed. Theory: Is a well-substantiated explanation on some aspect of a phenomenon. eg. distributed cognition, Cognitive theories based on human memory were used to depict operations to reduce memory load Vision: Is a future aspiration of some form of technology that guides research and aspirations of designers e.g. The Internet of Things, a teleportation device usually expressed in the form of a video. Model: a model is a simplification of some aspect of human-computer interaction that enable designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. e.g Newell's keystroke model, Norman’s model of emotional design Oretel et el’s model of emotional design: Products can be designed at the visceral level, having a good look, feel and design. At the behavioural level, they can have a certain functionality/usability and at the Reflective level, a user can be amazed at the meaning, the personal value and how brand loyalty a customer has for a product. How it appeals to their value system and cultural beliefs. 2.3 Identify and briefly discuss four typical problems or challenges that may occur during a heuristic evaluation. Use examples to Illustrate the problem. User Evaluation and Heuristic evaluation often yield very different results. Heuristics often miss critical errors e.g. A match between the system is obvious to the evaluator but not to the user. Experts tend to report problems that don’t exist. In the past experts predictions have been wrong. What one expert views as important might not be as important to a user and the expert might focus heavily on the item perceived as important to him, missing out on the big picture or user’s perspective. i.e. find problems where there aren’t any but miss out on actual problems. In a study performed, Only 33% of actual usability problems reported from Heuristics evaluations were actual problems, whilst 21% of actual user problems were missed entirely. 43% of usability errors by Heuristic evaluators turned out to be false alarms. The original guidelines were designed for PC’s. There are so many new devices and the Heuristics have to be adapted to take that into account. INF3720 May/June 2015 MEMO Page 5 of 5 Nielsen’s Heuristics of 2014 could be becoming antiquated. However, evaluators are converting design guidelines into heuristics and customizing them for different interfaces. 2.4 Design a five question, questionnaire that WIII help you answer the following question \"How easy IS It for student users to use MyUnisa?\" Is it easy for you to find information for one of your registered modules? Yes No Is it easy to find where to ask an e-tutor for guidance Yes No Was the my Unisa platform easy to learn? Yes No When you returned to the site, were you able to remember everything you learnt about the site? Yes No Is anything missing from the website that you would like to see? Was there anything that frustrated you about the website? What was difficult about engaging with the website. Was it easy to check the status of your account? Could you tell where to go to contact the e-tutor? Were you at any stage of your navigation of the site unsure of what to do? 2.5 Explain the format and nature of the questions that you have used. For each question Indicate and explain which (If any) of the Preece et al Six usability goals it Will measure I asked a combination of open-ended and closed questions. My questions pertain to all six usability goals: Learning Memorability usability Safety Effectiveness Efficiency","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
