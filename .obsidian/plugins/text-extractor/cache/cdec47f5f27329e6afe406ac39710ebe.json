[TURN OVER] 2 COS3712 May/June 2016 QUESTION 1: Graphics pipeline [15] 1.1 For many years, although application programs could set many parameters, the basic operations available within the graphics pipeline were fixed. Recently, both the vertex processor and the fragment processor are programmable by the application program. What are the main advantages of programmable shaders? [4] 1.2 Explain the differences between retained mode graphics and immediate mode graphics. [5] 1.3 Explain the differences between RGB, RGBA and indexed colour systems. [6] QUESTION 2: Transformations and Viewing [14] 2.1 Explain the term transformation as used in computer graphics. [1] 2.2 What is unique about affine transformations? Give two examples of affine transformations. [2] 2.3 Explain why translation and rotation are known as rigid body transformations. [2] 2.4 The model-view transformation is the concatenation of two transformations. Name and describe these two transformation s. [3] 2.5 A synthetic camera co-ordinate reference frame is given by a view reference point (VRP) a view plane normal (VPN) and a view up vector (VUP).Using a diagram show how these quantities describe the location and orientation of the synthetic camera. Explain in your description the terms view-orientation matrix and viewing coordinate system. [6] QUESTION 3: Hidden surface removal [8] 3.1 Describe the Z-buffer algorithm for hidden surface removal. [4] 3.2 Describe one major advantage of the Z-buffer algorithm. [1] 3.3 The Z-buffer algorithm can be problematic when dealing with opaque objects that are behind translucent objects. Explain how the algorithm can be modified to deal with this. [3] [TURN OVER] 3 COS3712 May/June 2016 QUESTION 4: Lighting and Shading [12] 4.1 Explain what diffuse reflection is in the real world. [1] 4.2 Lambert’s law is used derive the equation for calculating approximation to diffuse reflection in computer graphics. Explain Lambert’s law and show how it is used to derive the equation for diffuse reflection. [6] 4.3 Explain the difference between Gouraud and Phong shading with respect to the following: 4.3.1 The lighting calculation process. [2] 4.3.2 The appearance of objects shaded by each method. [2] 4.3.3 The shaders in which each method is implemented. [1] QUESTION 5: Discrete Techniques [13] 5.1 Explain the following three major mapping techniques: 5.1.1 Texture mapping. [2] 5.1.2 Bump mapping [2] 5.1.3 Reflection mapping [2] 5.2 During the process of texture mapping, when we map texture coordinates to the array of texels, we rarely get a point that corresponds to the center of a texel. This creates aliasing errors. Name and describe two basic strategies used in computer graphics to deal with this. [4] 5.3 Conceptually, the process of filling the inside of a polygon with a colour or pattern is equivalent to deciding which points in the plane of the polygon are interior (inside) points. One method to make this decision is called the Winding test. Describe this method briefly. [3] QUESTION 6: From vertices to fragments [8] Describe briefly, with the use of diagrams, the Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm.
