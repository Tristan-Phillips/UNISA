The solutions are often given briefly, but crucially the method by which the solution is to be found never seems to be mentioned. No doubt there is a small group of gifted individuals who can just figure these things out on their own. For the rest of us, it would be nice to have a systematic method of solving these problems. Problem Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river. They all need to get to the other side of the river and the only method of doing so is by means of a two person rowing boat. Unfortunately, if there are ever more cannibals than missionaries in the same place, the missionaries will get eaten. How can they all get safely across the river? Discussion This is not a trick question. There are no annoying things to guess, it is simply an exercise in pure logic. And a solution is possible. To clarify, the rowing boat can only travel with either one or two people on board. Nobody can swim in the crocodile and piranha infested waters. There are no trees or ropes or anything else, just the boat. As an example of the rules, if the rowing boat is at a river bank with one cannibal on board, whilst one missionary and one cannibal are on the river bank, that counts as having two cannibals in the same location as one missionary. The missionary would get eaten and therefore this situation, or any like it, is not allowed as part of the solution. Think about how you could go about solving this problem. If you can solve it then that’s great; compare your method to mine. If, after some thinking, you can’t even figure out how to get started, then I will give you a hint on the next page. But don’t look too soon! Leslie Green CEng MIEE 2 of 16 v1.0: Feb 2014 Spoiler Alert – stop reading now if you want to solve the problem on your own. Leslie Green CEng MIEE 3 of 16 v1.0: Feb 2014 Hint You cannot hope to solve this sort of problem without paper and a pen/pencil. The problem is not complicated in the sense that you need higher mathematics to solve it. However, it is complicated by the number of sequences that can occur. Once you can decide on a way to write down the problem you will have made a good start on the solution.

Leslie Green CEng MIEE 5 of 16 v1.0: Feb 2014 Second Hint This problem requires a step by step solution. Start from the given state, which is three missionaries and three cannibals on the left bank of the river. Define who is going to travel in the rowing boat and then you will have the next state when the boat reaches the other side of the river. There are five possible combinations of occupants of the rowing boat Missionary & Missionary Missionary & Cannibal Cannibal & Cannibal Missionary only Cannibal only Some of these will not be available for all trips because they won’t be on the river bank. For example, after the first trip across the river there can only be two people on the far river bank. The solution of the problem consists of systematically eliminating those cases which break the rules. To those who have studied a bit of mathematics, the problem may now seem tremendously complicated. If there are five possibilities for each trip, and it looks like we need 9 trips, that seems like 59 ≈ 2,000,000 possibilities to consider. Take heart! The problem is nowhere near as complicated as that. Have a go … Leslie Green CEng MIEE 6 of 16 v1.0: Feb 2014 Spoiler Alert – stop reading now if you want to solve the problem on your own. Leslie Green CEng MIEE 7 of 16 v1.0: Feb 2014 Tutorial Solution The first thing we need to do is to define a notation for the state of the problem at any point in time. I am going to use M to represent a missionary, C to represent a cannibal, and either a > or a < to indicate which bank the boat is on at the time, at the same time separating the people on the left and right banks of the river. The system state is then uniquely defined by these 7 symbols. All states will consist of seven symbols. The starting state is CCCMMM< where the left bank is the starting side of the river When there are three or less symbols that is a movement statement (who is in the boat and which way are they going), also know as a transition. I will represent a cannibal and a missionary in the boat going left to right by the movement statement CM> If that was the first step in the solution the resulting state when the boat reached the opposite river bank would be CCMM>CM In the second hint I said there were five possible contents of the rowing boat. Let’s simplify that a little. We are trying to get people from the left bank to the right bank. It therefore seems a bit strange to be only sending one person in the left to right direction. I will therefore guess that we will always have two people going left to right. If I can’t find a solution to the problem under that limitation then I will have to change my mind. For the moment then we have the possibilities CC> CM> MM> for left to right travel, and <CC <CM <MM <C <M for right to left travel. All this will soon become clear in the pictures that follow. Leslie Green CEng MIEE 8 of 16 v1.0: Feb 2014 I have just one more simplifying statement. I will never allow a step which completely undoes the previous step. So the movement CM> will never be followed by <CM because it would just take us back to where we came from. Ok, here we go. This is the first step in the solution.

Leslie Green CEng MIEE 13 of 16 v1.0: Feb 2014 It should be getting easier for you now. This is just a repetition of simple steps.

Leslie Green CEng MIEE 15 of 16 v1.0: Feb 2014 Leslie Green CEng MIEE 16 of 16 v1.0: Feb 2014 Let’s summarise the valid path. CCCMMM< CC> Two cannibals go across CMMM>CC <C … and one comes back CCMMM<C CC> Two cannibals go across MMM>CCC <C … and one comes back CMMM<CC MM> Two missionaries go across CM>CCMM <CM … and both a cannibal and a missionary come back CCMM<CM MM> Two missionaries go across CC>CMMM <C … and a cannibal comes back CCC<MMM CC> Two cannibals go across C>CCMMM <C … and a cannibal comes back CC<CMMM CC> Two cannibals go across. >CCCMMM Let’s review the method of solution. 1. Create a notation for the states. 2. Create a notation for the transitions between states. 3. Systematically try all possible transitions from a state, eliminating those transitions which break any of the rules of the problem. This type of problem involves a “tree search algorithm”, the various states branching out to multiple new states. I drew the diagrams using the program Evolus Pencil. I used > instead of → because the nice arrows wouldn’t paste into the pencil program correctly \u0000 If you have followed the method for this problem then this next problem should be easy. In any case I am not giving any hints or the solution. Problem A man has three valuable assets: a lion, a goat and a bale of hay. When he is there the animals are well behaved. If he leaves then the lion will eat the goat, or the goat will eat the hay. The lion will not eat the hay. He has to cross a river in a rowing boat and can only take one of his three assets at a time. How does he get all three assets safely across the river.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
