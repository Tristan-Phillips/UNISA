School of Computing have a small library, which is not associated with university’s main library. The library has a collection of information systems, computer science textbooks and journals. The library uses excel spreadsheet to manage the library and the challenge is that when borrowers get books from the library, they return them late or sometimes never return them. The borrowers include students and all school of computing staff. You have been approached by the School of Computing to design a library information system that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non-returned books are tracked. 2.1 As an Interaction designer you are required to be part of a team that develops the library information systems application. What are the duties of an Interaction designer? (1 marks) 2.2 Explain the phases of the Double Diamond of Design (page 38, prescribed book) in the context of the library information systems. Use the phases to produce an initial design of the library information systems using one or more sketches to show the main functions and the general look and feel of the system. The fourth phase is omitted because you are not expected to produce the final product. (10 marks) 2.3 Who are the potential stakeholders of library systems? Identify all of them (4 marks). 2.4 What is the importance of involving users during the design of the system? (5 marks) Question 3: Chapter 3 10 marks 3.1 What is a conceptual model? (1 mark) 3.2 In point form, describe the four components that make up a conceptual model (4 marks). 3.3 The use of a learning management system (LMS) creates more opportunities for learning in Open distance learning, namely: content creation and sharing, student- student interaction, and student-teacher interaction. This promotes student engagement and improve student learning. The advantages of employing LMS can be summarized as: • Learners have access to online resources such as MOOCs (Accessibility) • Online services are easy to use for most students (usability) • Learners can connect with other learners at anytime and anywhere (connectivity) • Students can create, upload, and share content (content). • Students can have synchronous and asynchronous interactions with one another (interaction). • LMS enables learner/teachers to give feedback efficiently (feedback) As an interaction designer, draw a conceptual model of a learning management system platform. Your conceptual model should reflect your experiences with myUNISA. The conceptual model should be simple and easy to understand (5 marks). Question 4: Chapter 5 10 marks Download the Telegram App from the Play Store or any other store available on your mobile device and familiarise yourself. Evaluate the current version of Telegram from the perspective of social interaction of distance learning students and discuss people’s social disposition, the ideal of face-to-face conversations and the challenges in this regard, especially during the Covid-19 lockdown. Also discuss remote conversations and co-presence of distance learning students. (10) Question 5: Chapter 6 10 marks Read this blog https://3.7designs.co/blog/2019/03/emotional-web-design/ Do an emotional interaction evaluation of the current version of Telegram App. Download the Telegram App from the Play Store or any other store available on your mobile device and familiarise yourself. 4.1 How was the interface of the current version of Telegram designed to persuade users to use it? (2 marks) 4.2 Do you find the current interface of telegram believable and trustworthy, support your answer? (2 marks) 4.3 What annoys you on the design of the telegram interface? Motivate your answer (2 marks). 4.4 Is the current version of Telegram aesthetically pleasing for South African users? Motivate your answer (2 marks). 4.5 Which technology(-ies) can be used by the app’s owning company to detect users’ emotional states? Explain your answer (2 marks) Question 6: Chapter 6 10 marks 6.1 From the perspectives of Anthony Ortony model of emotional design, how do you design interactive products that invoke the visceral, behavioural and reflective senses. (3 marks) 6.2 Visit the websites for UNISA, Wits and UCT and comment on how the design of their websites’ main page (first page) satisfies each of the components of Anthony Ortony’s model. Which websites persuade you to enrol at the university, support your answer? (3 marks) Visceral Behavioural Reflective UNISA Wits UCT 6.3 Based on the weaknesses that you identified from the above websites, design the front page of UNISA website with features that invokes the visceral emotions of students who seek to enrol at the university in 2023. You can use any application to design a non-interactive main page (MS Word, Powerpoint …or any other web editor). Focus on the design of the page not the functionality. Copy and paste the screenshot of the designed main page. Briefly describe how you incorporated the visceral component of Anthony Ortony model in the design of the website. (4 marks) Question 7: Chapter 8 10 marks In question 6, you recreated the main page of the UNISA website to improve user experience. Now you are now in the process of testing the user experience of the website: 7. 1 Who are the stakeholders of the website front page that you recreated? (2 marks) 7.2 Explain the type of sampling that you would use to select the participants in your study? (1 marks) 7.3 Explain how each of the following data gathering techniques can be used to collect data when testing the website front page that you recreated. (3 marks) Technique Explanation Interview questionnaire Observation 7.4 Explain why consent forms are valuable when collecting data. (2 marks) 7.5 List any 2 interview questions that you are going to use to collect data from students. (2 marks) Question 8: Chapter 11 20 marks School of Computing have a small library, which is not associated with university’s main library. The library has a collection of information systems and computer science textbooks and journals. The library uses excel spreadsheet to manage the library and the challenge is that when borrowers get books from the library, they return them late or sometimes never return them. The borrowers include students and all school of computing staff. You have been approached by the School of Computing to write a software program that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non-returned books are tracked. 8.1 Identify any two common types of requirements discovery in the context of the library system (2 marks). 8.2 Identify any 2 functional requirements of the library system (2 marks). 8.3 Choose one functional requirement of the library systems and present it as an atomic requirement. Use the Volere template (Page 389, prescribed book). (5 marks) 8.4 What are user stories? (2 mark) 8.5 Based on the functional requirement that you choose, express it as a user story. (2 marks) 8.6 Based on the information of potential users, choose a user profile, and produce a persona and a scenario capturing how the user is expected to interact with the library system.
