In response to this charter, we have also placed curriculum transformation high on the agenda. For your information, curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both the programme and module levels, as a phased-in approach. You will notice the implementation thereof in your modules, and we encourage you to fully embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa. 4 1 INTRODUCTION Welcome to COS1501! This is a semester module presented by the School of Computing. (The previous module code was COS101S.) This module is a blended online module as from 2017. This means that you have to work through the lessons on myUnisa, and follow the instructions when you are guided to work through the respective study guide units. This module focuses on discrete mathematics and its application in Computer Science. Concepts and skills needed for a theoretical understanding of Computer Science are introduced. If you feel a flash of fear when you hear the word “theoretical”, just remember that theory is much tidier than practice: one knows precisely what the meaning of the terms is and the problems always have solutions. Rigorous proofs are expected in this module. This module does not involve practical work on a computer, but there is a strong emphasis on practicing the skills acquired by means of doing many exercises and the assignments. Studying a mathematical module is rather like learning to play a musical instrument – the more you practice, the better you become! If you put an honest effort into trying to do the self- assessment exercises and assignments, we believe that by the end of the semester you will be able to do a lot of things you had never heard of before, and enjoy doing them. 2 PURPOSE OF AND OUTCOMES FOR THE MODULE 2.1 Purpose On completing this module, you will be able to critically apply the fundamental knowledge and skills of discrete mathematics. The module forms part of the theoretical foundation of a Computer Science major. This background is relevant to computing fields such as relational databases, the development of provably correct programs, and the analysis of algorithms that will contribute to the development of computing in Southern Africa, Africa, or globally. The module will support further studies and applications in the computing discipline. 2.2 Outcomes Specific outcome 1: Manipulate logical arguments, using a variety of mathematical tools. Specific outcome 2: Construct proofs in a clear and concise way using mathematical reasoning techniques. Specific outcome 3: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the definitions, laws and operations of set theory. Specific outcome 4: Synthesise and critically analyse relations, functions and binary sets that are represented as sets containing ordered pairs. Specific outcome 5: Perform operations on vectors and matrices. 3 LECTURERS AND CONTACT DETAILS 3.1 Lecturers It occasionally happens that the study material does not instantly transfer itself to one’s brain. In such an event, you are welcome to make an appointment with one of the COS1501 lecturers. The names and telephone numbers of the lecturers, as well as relevant email addresses and URLs, will be supplied in a COSALL tutorial letter. COS1501/101/3/2020 5 If there is something that is not clear in the tutorial matter or in the model solutions, you are welcome to make an appointment or send an email. You should make use of the module contact email address on myUnisa because a specific lecturer might not be available at the time. The response time with email is generally fast since we try to respond within 24 hours. Should you prefer, you may send a letter to the following address: The Lecturers, COS1501 School of Computing P O Box 392 UNISA 0003 Note that lecturers are only responsible for module content-related queries. You can communicate with fellow COS1501 students on the myUnisa discussion forum for this module. You will also be assigned to an e-tutor on myUnisa that will assist you. If your questions are not answered there, you can contact the lecturers. Also read section 5.2 of this letter regarding e-tutors. 3.2 School of Computing In 2013 the School of Computing moved to Florida. The general contact number for the school is 011 670 9200. Should you have difficulty in contacting your lecturers regarding an urgent matter, you can phone the pilot number of the school. Your message will then be conveyed to the relevant lecturer. Remember to provide your student number and relevant module code. 3.3 University If you need to contact the university about administrative matters, you should send your queries via e-mail to the specific department whose contact details are provided in the brochure Study@Unisa that you received in your study package. This brochure also contains other important information about Unisa. 4 MODULE-RELATED RESOURCES Please note that as from 2020 onwards you will only receive the Study guide and the Tutorial letter 101 in printed form for this module. All other tutorial matter will only be available on myUnisa. The Tutorial letter 101 will also be available on myUnisa – so please do not wait for your printed copy – everything you need to start studying is available on myUnisa. If you do not find a tutorial letter under Official Study Material, you will find it under Additional Resources. 4.1 Study guide (no prescribed book) No book is prescribed for this module. Instead, you are provided with a study guide. In the introductory unit of the study guide, information about this module and aspects on “how to study” are provided. Number sets are introduced and then we move on to set theory, studying sets based on these number sets. We investigate elements of, and operations on sets. Equality between sets is investigated by using Venn diagrams or by providing a formal proof. The concept of inclusion- exclusion is introduced. Certain kinds of sets turn out to be particularly useful, so they get special names such as relation and function. Relations are investigated, examining their properties and testing for particular types 6 of relation. We also study functions and their properties, as well as operations on functions. Binary operations are studied and then vectors and matrices are introduced. An introduction to logic is provided. Concepts from the field of logic, such as truth tables, connectives, quantification and predicates are introduced. Different mathematical proof strategies are implemented. Throughout, great emphasis is placed on sound reasoning and the ability to construct mathematical proofs. Note: Tutorial letter 103 under Additional Resources on myUnisa provides solutions to all the self- assessment exercises that are provided in the study guide. Tutorial letter 102 also under Additional Resources, provides other information including solutions to additional self- assessment questions and examples. 4.2 Lessons A pdf version of the lessons on myUnisa is also available under Additional resources on myUnisa. As explained before, the lessons will guide you through the sections in the study guide. 4.3 Recommended books Should you wish to know more about a particular topic, you may consult the following books. Please note that these books are not necessarily included in the Study Collection in the Unisa library. The library cannot guarantee that they will be available. ENSLEY, D.E. AND CRAWLEY, J.W.

Assessment criteria  Predicates and symbols are used, to represent properties or relations, all formulated as English sentences;  A given set of logical connectives is used to combine propositions and predicate logic atoms, correctly, from given English sentences into equivalent logic sentences;  Truth tables illustrate the result of logical connectives, with the correct relationships;  Quantifiers generalise over predicate logic sentences, within the context;  Classifications of compound statements include tautology, contradiction or neither;  Arguments around propositional and a predicate logic sentences are valid. Specific outcome 2: Construct proofs in a clear and concise way using mathematical reasoning techniques. Assessment criteria  Diagrams and mathematical notation are used to represent the structure of the problem correctly;  Rigorous, precise and convincing proofs are constructed correctly (direct proofs, proof by contraposition, proof by contradiction);  A counterexample is provided correctly in the case where a mathematical statement is not always true. Specific outcome 3: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding regarding the definitions, laws and operations of set theory. Assessment criteria  Sets are represented correctly using various notations;  New sets constructed from existing one using set operations are valid;  Set equality are determined correctly;  A counter-example in the case of set inequality is correct;  Sets represented using Venn diagrams are valid;  Equality of Venn diagrams are determined correctly;  A counter-example in the case of inequality of Venn diagrams is correct;  New Venn diagrams constructed from existing ones using set operations are valid. 12 Specific outcome 4: Synthesise and critically analyse relations, functions and binary sets that are represented as sets containing ordered pairs. Assessment criteria  Particular properties of relations are identified correctly;  Different kinds of relation are defined correctly;  Synthesised relations of a given kind are correct;  New relations constructed from existing ones are valid;  Functions having particular properties are identified correctly;  Inverse function of a given function are defined correctly;  The composition of two given functions is valid;  Synthesised functions of a given kind are valid;  Properties of binary operations can be determined correctly;  Synthesised binary operations satisfying given properties are valid. Specific outcome 5: Perform operations on vectors and matrices. Assessment criteria  Operations on vectors and matrices are applied in order to construct different ways of storing and listing numbered information correctly.  The synthesised vector or matrix that fits a place-holder within an equation or that holds defined properties is correct. 8.2 Assessment plan Why do assignments? In the first place, we need to provide proof to the Department of National Education that you are an active student, therefore it is compulsory to submit at least one assignment by the date specified for assignment 1 in section 6 above for the respective semester that you are registered for, otherwise you will not have exam admission. Furthermore, experience has shown that most students who do not work systematically during the semester, give up and do not write the examination. Important: Take special note of the solutions to the self-assessment exercises of the study guide that are provided in tutorial letter 103. These will help you to eliminate some of the mistakes that often occur in students’ examination solutions. An integrated assessment system is used for this module. This means that your final mark is based not only on your examination mark, but also on your performance during the semester. Assignments do not only provide you with an opportunity to evaluate your understanding of the prescribed material (or to give you feedback on your readiness for the examination), but also make a contribution towards your semester mark. Your final mark will be calculated as follows: Semester mark (out of 100) × 20% + Examination mark (out of 100) × 80% In order to pass this module, a final mark of at least 50% is required. COS1501/101/3/2020 13 Your semester mark is based on your assignment marks. Different weights are allocated to the individual assignments. If an assignment is not submitted or is submitted late (for whatever reason), no marks are awarded for such an assignment. It is your responsibility to ensure that your assignments are submitted on time. Multiple choice assignments are marked by a computer system at a time set out by the Assignment Section of Unisa – lecturers can therefore not give any extension for multiple choice assignments. The following weights are allocated to the individual assignments: Assignment 01: 20% Assignment 02: 40% Assignment 03: 40% Example: The following example shows how the assessment system works, assuming that assignments 01, 02 and 03 were all submitted. Assignment Mark × Weight Contribution to semester mark 01 90% × 0.20 18% 02 90% × 0.40 36% 03 90% × 0.40 36% Semester mark 90% The resulting semester mark is 90%. Suppose you obtain 80% in the examination. The final mark will be calculated as follows: (90 × 0.20)% + (80 × 0.80)% = (18.0 + 64.0)% = 82%. Note: The semester mark will not contribute towards the results of students writing a supplementary examination. 8.3 Assignment numbers 8.3.1 General assignment numbers The letter you are reading is very important. This is the only tutorial letter that you received in printed form. All other tutorial letters are available on myUnisa under Additional Resources. All tutorial letters contain important information, so make sure you read each one carefully. The letters are of three kinds: - those numbered 101 (such as this one), 102 are concerned specifically with the tutorial matter for COS1501; - those numbered 201, 202, 203 contain solutions to assignments; - Tutorial letter 103 contains some important formation, including a copy of the lessons on myUnisa, as well as solutions to the self-assessment exercises in the 101; - the COSALL tutorial letter contains important information (including the names and contact numbers of lecturers) for all students in the School of Computing. The School of Computing is situated at the Florida campus. 14 8.3.2 Unique assignment numbers Each assignment has its own unique assignment number which you will have to provide when you submit your assignments.

The solutions are in the tutorial letter 102 as well as in the lessons on myUnisa. CAI tutorial: In sections 4.3 & 11 of this tutorial letter it is mentioned that you can work through the CAI tutorial “Relations” that is downloadable from the web. In preparation of this assignment, navigate through all the sections in the tutorial. Graphical illustrations are also provided. Additional self-assessment questions: Attempt these written questions which are provided in the tutorial letter 103 as well as in the lessons on myUnisa. You can do these questions in preparation of this assignment. Only submit the solutions to the multiple choice questions given in this assignment. Examination paper: Although the exam paper is an MCQ paper, you will need to write down proofs on rough, for example, or draw Venn diagrams on rough before you will be able to select the correct alternative. It is therefore very important to attempt the self-assessment questions. You will receive a practice exam paper later in the semester. Note: Answer all the questions for this assignment. The mark that you achieve from the possible 15 marks will be converted to a percentage. Hints: If a relation is provided in a question, make sure that your alternative of choice (relation) is defined on the set indicated in the question. For example, if a relation is defined on A = {a, b, c} but a relation R = {a, b), (b, c), (c, d)} is provided in some alternative, whatever the question is, this alternative is immediately disqualified because (c, d)  R but d  A. To form a subset of some set L (say), keep the outside brackets of L, then throw away some elements of L to form a subset of L. Refer to the definition of a subset in the study guide.

Let T be a relation from A = {0, 1, 2, 3} to B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} such that (a, b) T iff b2 – a2 is an odd number. (A, B  U = Z.) (Hint: Write down all the elements of T. For example, if 4  B and 1  A then 42 – 12 = 16 – 1 = 15 which is an odd number, thus (1, 4)  T.) Answer questions 5 and 6 by using the defined relation T. 24 Question 5 Which one of the following alternatives provides only elements belonging to T? 1. (3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2) 2. (0, 1), (2, 4), (2, 3) 3. (3, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4) 4. (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3) Question 6 Which one of the following statements regarding the relation T is true? 1. T is transitive. 2. T is symmetric. 3. T is antisymmetric. 4. T is irreflexive. Consider the following relation on set B = {a, b, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}: P = {(a, b), (b, {a, b}), ({a, b}, a), ({b}, a), (a, {a})}. Answer questions 7 to 10 by using the given relation P and the set B. Question 7 Which one of the following alternatives represents the range of P (ran(P))? 1. {a, b, {a}, {a, b}} 2. {a, b, {a}, {b}, {a, b}} 3. {a, b, {b}, {a, b}} 4. {a, b, {a, b}} Question 8 Which one of the following relations represents the composition relation P ○ P (ie P; P)? 1. {(a, {a, b}), (b, a), ({a, b}, a), ({b}, {a}), (a, {a})} 2. {(a, {a, b}), (b, a), ({a, b}, a), ({b}, {a})} 3. {(a, {a, b}), (b, a), ({a, b}, {a}), ({a, b}, b), ({b}, b), ({b}, {a})} 4. {(a, {a, b}), (b, a), ({a, b}, {a}), ({a, b}, b), ({b}, {a})} Question 9 The relation P does not satisfy trichotomy. Which ordered pairs should be included in P so that an extended relation P1 (say) would satisfy trichotomy? (For trichotomy, each element of B must be paired with each other different element in B to form elements of P1. For example, we see that b  {a} but neither (b, {a}) nor ({a}, b) are elements of P, but at least one of these elements should be an element of P1. We include (b, {a}) in P1: P1 = {(a, b), (b, {a, b}), ({a, b}, a), ({b}, a), (a, {a}), (b, {a}), ...}. COS1501/101/3/2020 25 Now check all the different elements of B and if two different elements of B are not already grouped in an ordered pair of P, they should be paired and be included as elements of P1. You can ask the question: Which ordered pairs should be included in P1 so that it will be true that for all x, y  B with x ≠ y, we have (x, y)  P1 or (y, x) P1? Refer to study guide, p 78.) Choose the alternative that provides all the missing ordered pairs that should be included as elements of P1 in order for P1 to be a relation that satisfies trichotomy. 1. (b, {a}), (b, {b}), (b, a), ({a}, {a, b}) & ({a, b}, {b}) 2. ({a}, b), (b, {b}), ({b}, {a, b}) & ({a, b}, {a}) 3. (b, {a}), ({b}, b), ({a}, {b}), ({b}, {a, b}) & ({a, b}, {a}) 4. (b, {a}), (b, {b}), ({a}, {b}) & ({a, b}, {a, b}) Question 10 Which one of the following sets is a partition S of B = {a, b, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}? 1. {{a, b, {a}, {b}}, {{a, b}}} 2. {{a}, {b}, {a, b}} 3. {{a, b, {a}}, {{a}, {b}, {a, b}}} 4. {a, b, {a}, {b}, {a, b}} (A partition of the given set B can be defined as a set S = {S1, S2, S3, …}. The members of S are subsets of B (each set Si is called a part of S) such that a. for all i, Si =/ 0/ (that is, each part is nonempty), b. for all i and j, if Si =/ Sj, then Si  Sj = 0/ (that is, different parts have nothing in common), and c. S1  S2  S3  … = B (that is, every element in B is in some part Si). It is possible to form different partitions of B depending on which subsets of B are formed to be elements of S. Test whether the sets given in the different alternatives meet all the criteria given in the above definition. Note that the elements of a partition of B must be subsets of B. Subsets of B are formed when you keep the outside brackets of B and then throw away all, some or no element of B. For example, keep the outside brackets of B, then throw away the element {a}, then the subset {a, b, {b}, {a, b}} of B are formed. Refer to study guide, pp 94, 95.) Suppose U = {1, 2, 3, a, b, c} is a universal set with the subset A = {a, c, 2, 3}. Let R = { (a, a), (a, c), (3, c), (3, a), (2, 3), (2, a), (2, c), (c, 2) } be a relation on A.

Suppose (x, y)  R then x2 + y2 = 2k for some k  0. ie y2 + x2 = 2k for some k  0. thus (x, y)  R. 2. Let x, y  Z be given. Suppose (x, y)  R then x2 + y2 = 2k for some k  0. ie y2 + x2 = 2k for some k  0. thus (y, x)  R. 3. Let x, y  Z be given. Suppose (x, y)  R then x2 + y2 = 2k for some k  0. thus (y, x)  R. 4. Let x, y  Z be given. Suppose (x, x)  R then x2 + y2 = 2k for some k  0. ie y2 + x2 = 2k for some k  0. thus (y, y)  R.

Question 15 Which one of the alternatives is a proof by contrapositive of the statement “If x3 – x + 4 is not divisible by 4 then x even.” 1. Required to prove: If x3 – x + 4 is not divisible by 4 then x even. Proof: Suppose x is odd. Let x = 2k + 1, then we have to prove that x3 – x + 4 is divisible by 4. x3 – x + 4 = (2k + 1)3 – (2k + 1) + 4 = (2k + 1)(4k2 + 4k +1) – 2k – 1 + 4 = 8k3 + 8k2 + 2k + 4k2 + 4k +1 – 2k – 1 + 4 = 8k3 + 12k2 + 4k + 4 = 4(2k3 + 3k2 + k + 1), which is divisible by 4. (4 multiplied by any integer is divisible by 4) 2. Required to prove: If x3 – x + 4 is not divisible by 4 then x even. Proof: Assume that x3 – x + 4 is not divisible by 4. Then x can be even or odd. We assume that x is odd. Let x = 2k + 1, then x3 – x + 4 = (2k+1)3 – (2k + 1) + 4 = (2k + 1)(4k2 + 4k +1) – 2k – 1 + 4 = 8k3 + 8k2 + 2k + 4k2 + 4k +1 – 2k – 1 + 4 = 8k3 + 12k2 + 4k + 4 = 4(2k3 + 3k2 + k + 1), which is divisible by 4. (4 multiplied by any integer is divisible by 4) But this is a contradiction to our original assumption. Therefore x must be even if x3 – x + 4 is not divisible by 4. 3. Required to prove: If x3 – x + 4 is not divisible by 4 then x even. Proof: Let x = 4 be an even element of Z. We can replace x with 4 in the expression x3 – x + 4. x3 – x + 4 = (4)3 – (4) + 4 = 64 – 4 + 4 = 64 which is divisible by 4. 36 4. Required to prove: If x3 – x + 4 is not divisible by 4 then x even. Proof: Assume that x is even, ie x = 4k, then x3 – x + 4 = (4k)3 – (4k) + 4 = 64k3 – 4k + 4 = 4(16k3 – k + 1), which is divisible by 4.

The solutions are in the tutorial letter 103 as well as in the lessons on myUnisa. CAI tutorial: In sections 4.3 & 11 of this tutorial letter it is mentioned that you can work through the CAI tutorial “Relations” that is downloadable from the web. In preparation of this assignment, navigate through all the sections in the tutorial. Graphical illustrations are also provided. Additional self-assessment questions: Attempt these written questions which are provided in the tutorial letter 103 as well as in the lessons on myUnisa. You can do these questions in preparation of this assignment. Only submit the solutions to the multiple choice questions given in this assignment. Examination paper: Although the exam paper is an MCQ paper, you will need to write down proofs on rough, for example, or draw Venn diagrams on rough before you will be able to select the correct alternative. It is therefore very important to attempt the self-assessment questions. You will receive a practice exam paper later in the semester. Note: Answer all the questions for this assignment. The mark that you achieve from the possible 15 marks will be converted to a percentage. Hints: If a relation is provided in a question, make sure that your alternative of choice (relation) is defined on the set indicated in the question. For example, if a relation is defined on A = {a, b, c} but a relation R = {a, b), (b, c), (c, d)} is provided in some alternative, whatever the question is, this alternative is immediately disqualified because (c, d)  R but d  A. To form a subset of some set L (say), keep the outside brackets of L, then throw away some element(s) of L to form a subset of L. Refer to the definition of a subset in the study guide.

The members of S are subsets of B (each set Si is called a part of S) such that a. for all i, Si =/ 0/ (that is, each part is nonempty), b. for all i and j, if Si =/ Sj, then Si  Sj = 0/ (that is, different parts have nothing in common), and c. S1  S2  S3  … = B (that is, every element in B is in some part Si). It is possible to form different partitions of B depending on which subsets of B are formed to be elements of S. Test whether the sets given in the different alternatives meet all the criteria given in the above definition. Note that the elements of a partition of B must be subsets of B. Subsets of B are formed when you keep the outside brackets of B and then throw away all, some or no element of B. For example, keep the outside brackets of B, then throw away the element {a}, then the subset {a, b, {b}, {a, b}} of B are formed. Refer to study guide, pp 94, 95.) COS1501/101/3/2020 45 Question 10 Consider the following relation on A: R = {(1, 1), (1, {2}), (1, {3, 4}), ({2}, 1), ({2}, {2}), ({2}, {3, 4}), ({3, 4}, {2}) }. Which one of the following statements regarding the relation R is TRUE? 1. R is reflexive, transitive and anti-symmetric. 2. R is irreflexive, transitive and symmetric. 3.

(5, -3) Question 14 R is a symmetric relation. Which of the following alternatives can be used to prove that R is a symmetric relation? 1. Let x, y  Z be given such that (x, y)  R and (y, x)  R then y > 1 – x = x > 1 – y ie y > 1 – x = x – 1 > –y ie y > 1 – x = 1 – x < y (multiply by -1, which changes > to < as well) 2. Let x, y  Z be given such that (x, y)  R. We have to prove that (y, x)  R, ie. x > 1 – y If (x, y)  Z then y > 1 – x ie y – 1 > –x ie 1 – y < x (multiply by -1, which changes > to <) ie x > 1 – y thus (y, x)  R. 3. (5, -3)  R and (-3, 5)  R, therefore R is symmetric. We substitute the ordered pairs (5, -3) and (-3, 5) in y > 1 – x and 1 – x < y for the proof: -3 > 1– 5 and 5 > 1 – (-3) ie -3 > -4, which is true ie 5 > 4, which is also true 4. R is not a symmetric relation. We give a counterexample: The ordered pairs (5, -4) and (-4, 5) are not ordered pairs in R. We substitute the ordered pairs (5, -4) and (-4, 5) in y > 1 – x and 1 – x < y for the proof: -4 > 1– 5 and 5 > 1 – (-4) ie -4 > -4, which is false ie 5 > 5, which is also false We have proved that R is not symmetric.

R is an equivalence relation. (For trichotomy, each element of some set S must be paired with each other different element in S. For example, let S = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)} be a relation on the set T = {1, 2, 3}. We see that each element in T is paired with each other different element in T in the ordered pairs of S.) 48 8.6.6 Semester 2: Assignment 03 Unique number: Due date: Material to be tested: Submission procedure: Weight towards semester mark: 833636 8 October 2020 Study guide, study units 6.4 - 10 Tutorial letters 102 and 103, lessons 7 - 10 Electronic submission via myUnisa.. 40% Important: Do the self-assessment exercises in the activities in the study guide before attempting this assignment.

Required to prove: If x is odd, then 2x2 – 3x + 7 is even. Proof: Suppose x is odd. Let x = 2k + 1, then we have to prove that 2x2 – 3x + 7 is even. 2x2 – 3x + 7 = 2(2k+1)2 – 3(2k + 1) + 7 = 2(4k2 + 4k +1) – 6k – 3 + 7 = 8k2 + 8k + 2 – 6k – 3 + 7 = 8k2 + 2k + 6 = 2(4k2 + k + 3), which is even (2 multiplied by any integer is even) 2. Assume that 2x2 – 3x + 7 is odd. Then x can be even or odd. We assume that x is odd. Let x = 2k + 1, then 2x2 – 3x + 7 = 2(2k+1)2 – 3(2k + 1) + 7 = 2(4k2 + 4k +1) – 6k – 3 + 7 = 8k2 + 8k + 2 – 6k – 3 + 7 = 8k2 + 2k + 6 = 2(4k2 + k + 3), which is even (2 multiplied by any integer is even) But this is a contradiction to our original assumption. Therefore x must be even if 2x2 – 3x + 7 is odd. 3. Let x = 2 be an even element of Z. We can replace x with 2 in the expression 2x2 – 3x + 7. 2x2 – 3x + 7 = 2(2)2 – 3(2) + 7 = 8 – 6 + 7 = 9, which is odd. We have therefore proven that if 2x2 – 3x + 7 is odd, then x is even. 4. Required to prove: if 2x2 – 3x + 7 is odd, then x is even. Proof: Assume that x is even, ie x = 2k, then 2x2 – 3x + 7 = 2(2k)2 – 3(2k) + 7 = 8k2 – 6k + 7 = 2(4k2 – 3k + 3) + 1, which is odd. We have therefore proven that if if 2x2 – 3x + 7 is odd, then x is even. 8.7 Other assessment methods Except for the activities in the study guide and the self-assessment exercises in the Tutorial letter 102, which has already been discussed, there are no other formal assessment methods. COS1501/101/3/2020 55 8.8 The examination A two hour examination will be scheduled for this module. Please refer to the brochure Study@Unisa for general examination guidelines and examination preparation guidelines. Examination information will be provided to you with more specific details on the examination paper that will be an MCQ paper. You will still have to draw diagrams on rough or do proofs on rough before you will be able to select the correct alternative for a question in the exam, so it is important that you attempt the self-assesment assignments questions. A past examination paper with solutions is provided in tutorial letter 103. You will also be provided with a practice exam later in the semester. Note that you gain admission to the examination of COS1501 by submitting at least one assignment by the date specified for assignment 1. 9 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS The Study@Unisa brochure contains an A-Z guide of the most relevant study information. Is each COS1501 student assigned to an e-tutor? You can communicate with your assigned e-tutor via myUnisa and e-mail. Please activate your myLife e-mail account to simplify the process. Students are assigned to tutors in batches of 200. It could happen that an overflowing group of less than 200 students is not assigned to a tutor. Unfortunately this is how the system functions. Are past examination papers available? Past papers are available on the COS1501 myUnisa web site. No solutions are provided for these. You can do the questions in the old examination papers and discuss your answers with the e-tutor and other students on your e-tutor site.

We have tried these steps without experiencing any problem. Depending on your browser and operating system, there might be a slight variation in these steps. Ask someone experienced with computers to help you if you struggle. Also note that you should have WINZIP already loaded on your computer. Find it free on the internet. How do I navigate through the tutorial? The main menu appears at the beginning of the tutorial, providing all the sections in the tutorial. You can choose to do some section and at the end of the section a submenu/menu will appear, providing a choice as to the section of work to do next. A section already completed will be indicated by a red tick. You may do sections in any sequence but we recommend that you do them in the sequence shown. You may repeat sections as often as you like. The red tick showing that a section has already been done can be removed on the main menu. In order to progress from one screen to another in the tutorial, you should click on one of the buttons that appears at the bottom of the screen. The words on the buttons appear either in white or grey. A white word indicates that the button is active, while the buttons with the grey text are inactive for that particular screen. Back: Return to the previous screen Repeat: Re-do the current screen Exit: Get directly out of the tutorial Menu: Return to main or submenu Forward: Continue to the next screen Problems while running the tutorial: If the first screen is unattractive and spotty, your screen setting may be too low quality. Change your computer’s display settings to 16-bit or higher. To change the screen colours: (if not 16-bit or higher) - Click on the Start menu. - Move your mouse to Settings. - Click on Control panel. - Double click on the Display icon. - Click on the Settings tab. - Click on the Colours drop down menu and choose High Color(16-bit) or True Color (32-bit). - Click on OK.
