This is because they use the system on a daily basis .Incorporation of costly system features that users cannot or would not want to use can be avoided. Users can be provided with a system that meets their real expectations instead of what designers and developers thought they would want, and thus users won’t encounter surprises when the new system is delivered. By involving users during the process, they will gain a better understanding of the system which will result in more effective use since they would have seen its capabilities from the early stages of development. Users who were involved in the software development process and feel that they have contributed to a product’s development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership 4.1 Briefing session, evaluation period, and debriefing 4.2 a) Recognise needs of diverse users, this could be age range, disability, expert differences. Catering for novices with explanations and for experts with certain features, can enrich a design b) Action should be reversible, feature relieves anxiety, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options c) Experienced users desire the sense they are in control of the interface and the interface responds to their actions. No surprises or change in familiar behaviour, and annoyed by tedious data entry sequences d) Sequence of actions should be organised into groups with a beginning, middle and end. Informative feedback at completion of group of actions gives operators satisfaction of accomplishment","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
