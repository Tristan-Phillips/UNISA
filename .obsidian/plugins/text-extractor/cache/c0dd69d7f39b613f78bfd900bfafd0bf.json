By interaction design, we mean designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives. Basically, creating user experience that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate, and interact. 1.2. List and definition of 4 design principles:  Visibility making relevant parts visible and what needs to be done obvious –  Constraints - Restricting the possible actions a user can perform  Affordance - Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it  Feedback - Sending information back to a user about what has been done 1.3 Usability goals: USEABILITY GOALS POSITIVE (UNISA) NEGATIVE (UNISA) Utility refers to the extent to which the – product provides the right kind of functionality so that the users can do what they need to do. Does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will enable users to carry out all their tasks in the way they want to do them? Online resources can be created and managed with ease. Safety Involves protecting the user from – dangerous conditions and undesirable conditions. What is the range of the errors that are possible using the product and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily from them. Each user is afforded a unique profile guarded as a platform b‘closed’ y a user login (username and password) with – a further option to reset same in any event. Efficiency Refers to the way a product – supports users in carrying out their tasks. Once users have learned how to use a It allows users to share, create, distribute, manage, and track C2 General product to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity? learning content through an efficient platform Effectiveness refers to how good a – product is at doing what it is supposed to do. Is the product capable of allowing people to learn, carry out their work efficiently, and access the information they need, or buy the goods they want? The platform is effective in addressing most usability goals as necessary from LMS to enable users to carry out their work efficiently Learnability – Refers to how easy a system is to use. It is possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying out certain actions. How hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way? The UNISA-LMS is easy to navigate as most links are self-explanatory and visible. In immediate contrast to the mentioned, ‘pro’ some of the modules ’ content is spread across 2 sites causing confusion and frustration for users. QUESTION 2 2.1. Four basic activities involved in the process of interaction  Identifying needs and establishing requirements for the user experience  Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements  Building interactive versions of the design so that they can be communicated and assessed  Evaluating what is being built throughout the process and the user experience it offers. 2.2. Discovering Requirements Evaluating Prototyping Discovering Alternatives Final product C2 General 2.3. Electronic library system  Gather and elicit the Requirements fo an interactive E-Library system by means of interaction with identified r stakeholders.  Do a feasibility study and document the requirements accordingly.  Consider and compare alternatives as part of the feasibility study and present a Case.  Prototype and build a model to simulate the functionality as documented of ‘what the system must be able to deliver and how it is to deliver . ’  Evaluate if the functionality addresses the requirements as documented revisit as necessary and continue – to document enhancements and changes accordingly. QUESTION 3 3.1. Terms with respect to interaction design:  Paradigms: a set of practices (what to ask, what to observe, how to analyse and interpret findings).  Vision: A design vision exists to provide top-level inspiration and guidance for the design team and serves several purposes.  Theories: cognitive, social, organisational.  Models: abstracted from a theory from a contributing discipline such as psychology.  Frameworks: to scope the user experience, advice as to what to design, what to look out for. 3.2. I have used the following real-life load shedding app/website: Purpose of conceptual models: Core components Discussion of Components Application of component 1. EskomSePush  It’s probably the most aesthetically pleasing load shedding app you can get on Google Play.  Adding shedding zones is a simple scrolling process, while searching is smooth and quick.  Tapping on a zone displays more granular information for up to three days.  Would be great if one could add areas based on your home address.  Lacks granular options, including notification tweaks that its competitors feature – would be a great improvement to revisit this component.  The forecast calendar doesn’t have a legend, the icons are also ambiguous; hence it’s not immediately understandable. C2 General  Another tab includes a “Forecast” outlook for the week ahead. 2. Load Shedding Notifier  User can select more than one municipality or zone within a city, or across multiple cities.  Users can also set notification times and intervals.  App includes notifications and info for forecasts, early warnings and Eskom grid status updates.  The app has a super simple user interface.  Could be more aesthetically pleasing.  Convoluted design means that access to “Advanced search” is only granted if you cancel “Easy search”.  You can’t add areas based on address, so you’ll need to know your zones beforehand. Question 4 TYPE OF SUPPORT APPLICATION Distance education – 1. Remote conversation 1 Video conferencing - comprises the technologies for the reception and transmission of audio-video signals by users at different locations, for communication between people in real time.  Skype (for Business)  Microsoft Teams  Zoom  Slack  BlueJeans  Cisco Webex 2. Remote conversation 2 Videotelephony – audio and visual reception per mobile phone device.  Mobile phone video calling capability. 3. Remote conversation 3 Audio conferencing – audio reception and transmission of voice only.  Polycom audio device  Jabra Speak 510 wireless Bluetooth speaker 1. Co-presence 1 Smart Board - a brand of interactive whiteboard. It allows teachers and students to control the computer through touching the screen. The SMART Notebook software allows teachers and students to easily create interactive lessons.  Smart Tech Smart Board M600  eBeam Smartmarker Complete 2. Co-presence 2 Instant messaging – texting platform.  WhatsApp IM QUESTION 5 DESIGN ELEMENT PLEASURABLE INTERFACES ANNOYING INTERFACES C2 General a) Visceral design Taps into the users emotion for a pleasurable and pleasant user experience by use of colour or animation to compel the user to interact positively ( emotional ‘ blackmailing’) UI does not appeal or draw in the user. Hence user is not compelled to interact positively. May appear gimmicky. Not aesthetically pleasing to invoke pleasant emotion in the user. b)Behavioural/reflective level The behavioural level essentially refers to the emotions we feel as a result of either accomplishing or failing to complete our goals, e.g. experiences at the behavioural level include the pleasure derived from being able to find a contact and make a call immediately on a mobile phone, the of typing on a ease computer keyboard. Reflective level can the user relate in terms if self-image and tell a story. VERSUS the difficulty of typing on a small touchscreen device, such as an iPod Touch. VERSUS not being able to relate and reflect as it has no meaning to the individual. c) Feedback-level A bond between the user and the product. No connection between the user and the product. d) Persuasive level Technology used to draw people’s attention to certain kinds of information in an attempt to change what they do or think. Can lead user(s) into a false sense of belief and be deceptive. e) Mood elements Screen characters are more pleasant than dialogue boxes. People can get tired of artificial screen character and may ignore s them.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
