Objectives The main aims of this chapter are to: • Explain the difference between good and poor interaction design. • Describe what interaction design is and how it relates to human–computer interaction and other fields. • Explain the relationship between the user experience and usability. • Describe what and who is involved in the process of interaction design. • Outline the different forms of guidance used in interaction design. • Enable you to evaluate an interactive product and explain what is good and bad about it in terms of the goals and core principles of interaction design. Chapter Summary Key Points: • Interaction design is concerned with designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives. • Interaction design is multidisciplinary, involving many inputs from wide-ranging disciplines and fields. • The notion of the user experience is central to interaction design. • Optimizing the interaction between users and interactive products requires taking into account a number of interdependent factors, including context of use, types of activity, accessibility, cultural differences, and user groups. • Identifying and specifying relevant usability and user experience goals can help lead to the design of good interactive products. • Design principles, such as feedback and simplicity, are useful heuristics for analyzing and evaluating aspects of an interactive product. What is interaction design? Interaction design means designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives. Put another way, it is about creating user experiences that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate, and interact. The process involves four basic activities: establishing requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping and evaluating. These activities are intended to inform one another and to be repeated. What is usability? Usability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective. It involves optimizing the interactions people have with interactive products to enable them to carry out their activities at work, at school, and in their everyday lives. P a g e 4 | 33 Name and discuss the usability goals. 1. Effectiveness – a very general goal referring to how good a product is at doing what it’s supposed to do. Question: Is the product capable of allowing people to learn, carry out their work efficiently, access the information they need, or buy the goods they want? 2. Efficiency – refers to the way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks, e.g. fewer steps to accomplish things. Question: Once users have learned how to use a product to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity? 3. Safety – To make interactive products safer in this sense involves 1) preventing the user from making serious errors by reducing the risk of wrong keys/buttons being mistakenly activated (e.g. not placing the quit or delete-file command right next to the save command on a menu) and 2) providing users with various means of recovery should the make errors. Undo functionality. Question: What is the range of errors that are possible using the product and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily from them? 4. Utility – refers to the extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to. Question: Does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will enable users to carry out all their tasks in the way they want to do them? 5. Learnability – refers to how easy a system is to learn and use. Pop-up tutorials can help with more complex systems but ideally people should be able to become more competent without a lot of effort. Question: Is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying out certain actions? How hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way? 6. Memorability – refers to how easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned. Especially important for products that are used infrequently. Question: What kinds of interface support have been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for the products and operations they use infrequently? What is user experience and what are some user experience goals? User experience is concerned with “all aspects of the user’s experience when interacting with the product, service, environment or facility”. Focussed on emotions and feelings of the user when using the product. User experience goals would be to achieve the desirable aspects and avoid the undesirable aspects of the experience: P a g e 5 | 33 Desirable aspects: Satisfying Enjoyable Engaging Pleasurable Cognitively stimulating Exciting Entertaining Helpful Motivating Surprising Undesirable aspects: Boring Frustrating Annoying Childish Unpleasant Patronizing Making one feel stupid Explain the role of software design principles. ▪ Used by interaction designers to aid their thinking when designing for user experience by helping to orient their thinking about different aspects of their designs. ▪ Derived from theory-based knowledge, experience and common sense, and suggest to designers what to provide and what to avoid at the interface – the do’s and don’ts of interaction design. ▪ Not intended to specify how to design an actual interface. List five design principles that are concerned with how to determine what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product. 1. Visibility – The more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know what to do next. 2. Feedback – Sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. 3. Constraints – Determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. 4. Consistency – Designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks. 5. Affordance – Refers to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it, to ‘give a clue’. There are two types of affordance, Perceived and Real. McCarthy and Wright (2004) 4 core threads that make up holistic experiences. 1. Sensual Thread: Concerned with our sensory engagement with a situation. Can involve thrill, fear, pain, comfort, etc. 2. Compositional Thread: Concerned with narrative part of an experience, as it unfolds, and the way a person makes sense of it. The compositional thread is the internal thinking we do during experiences. P a g e 6 | 33 3. Emotional Thread: The framework points out how emotions are intertwined with the situation in which they arise. Emotions also involve making judgements of value. 4. Spatio-temporal Thread: Refers to the space and time in which our experiences take place and their effect upon those experience. Chapter 2 – Understanding and conceptualising Interaction Objectives The main aims of this chapter are to: • Explain what is meant by the problem space. • Explain how to conceptualize interaction. • Describe what a conceptual model is and how to begin to formulate one. • Discuss the use of interface metaphors as part of a conceptual model. • Outline the core interaction types for informing the development of a conceptual model. • Introduce paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks informing interaction design. Summary This chapter has explained the importance of understanding and conceptualizing the problem and design space before trying to build anything. It has stressed throughout the need to be explicit about the claims and assumptions behind design decisions that are suggested. It described an approach to formulating a conceptual model and described the evolution of interface metaphors that have been designed as part of the conceptual model. Finally, it considered other ways of conceptualizing interaction, in terms of interaction types, paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks. Key points: • It is important to have a good understanding of the problem space, specifying what it is you are doing, why, and how it will support users in the way intended. • A fundamental aspect of interaction design is to develop a conceptual model. • A conceptual model is a high-level description of a product in terms of what users can do with it and the concepts they need in order to understand how to interact with it. • Decisions about conceptual design should be made before commencing physical design (e.g. choosing menus, icons, dialog boxes). • Interface metaphors are commonly used as part of a conceptual model. • Interaction types (e.g. conversing, instructing) provide a way of thinking about how best to support the activities users will be doing when using a product or service. • Paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks provide different ways of framing and informing design and research. P a g e 7 | 33 What is a conceptual model? A conceptual model provides a working strategy and a framework of general concepts and their interrelations which describes at a high level how a system is organised and operates. It is used by the design team as the basis from which to develop more detailed and concrete aspects of the design. What are the benefits of conceptualizing the design space early on? Orientation – enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the targeted users. Open-mindedness – preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focussed early on. Common ground – allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on. Discuss the core components of a conceptual model. The relationships between these core components and how they are organised determines the user experience. 1. Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity (e.g. browsing and bookmarking). 2. The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task-domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them (e.g. saving, organising). 3. The relationships between those concepts (e.g. whether one object contains another and the relative importance of actions to others). 4. The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (e.g. one can revisit through looking at a list of visited sites, most frequently visited, or saved websites). Discuss the purpose and core components of conceptual models and apply these to a typical online shopping system. (10) The purpose of a conceptual model is to provide a high-level description of how a system is organised and operates; it provides a framework of general concepts and their relationships allowing designers to get a clear understanding of the requirement for starting to code. (2) Components 1. Metaphors and analogies – convey to people what a product is for (1) P a g e 8 | 33 2. The concepts that people are exposed to through the product / Task domain objects, and their operations and their attributes and operations (1) 3. The relationship between the concepts (objects) (1) 4. The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (1). Application: 1. Metaphors – an online shop allows users to browse for items, to put them into a virtual shopping trolley, and pay for the items (1). 2. Attributes and prices of products: verbal description; photos; selecting and deselecting items; payments (1). 3. Relationships: similar products shown; other products shown that are often bought together; customer’s details, balance and shopping history (1) 4. Mappings: how often does the customer browse for items and how often does the customer return to the site? How does online shopping change the way we shop and think about shopping? (1) What is an interface metaphor? An interface metaphor is a conceptual model that is instantiated as part of the user interface and is similar in some way to aspects of a physical entity but also has its own behaviours and properties. For example, the desktop metaphor in modern operating systems like Windows and MacOS. In which three ways can metaphors and analogies be applied in conceptual design? ▪ A way of conceptualising what we are doing, e.g. surfing the web, which conjures up imagery of an ocean of information that we are traversing. ▪ As a conceptual model instantiated at the interface, e.g. a material metaphor like the ‘paper’ card, which has strong associations with cards in real life that contain limited related information, can be sorted and flicked through easily. ▪ As a way of visualising an operation, e.g. an icon of a shopping cart into which we place items we wish to purchase on an online shopping website. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of metaphors. Advantages ▪ Interface metaphors are based on conceptual models that combine familiar knowledge with new concepts, hence, helps users to easily understand the underlying model. ▪ Exploit user’s familiar knowledge, helping them to understand the unfamiliar, hence, makes learning new systems easier. P a g e 9 | 33 ▪ It is easier to learn and talk about what you are doing on a computer interface in terms of what you familiar to in your daily life. ▪ Enables a greater diversity of users to understand computer functionality. ▪ Improve users’ confidence. Disadvantages ▪ Designers sometimes have a misconception; they try to design an interface metaphor to look and behave like the physical entity it is compared with. ▪ Breaks conventional and cultural rules. ▪ Constrains designers in the way they conceptualize the problem space. ▪ Conflict with design principles. ▪ Not being able to understand the system functionality beyond the metaphor. ▪ Designers can base their designs on existing objects that were badly designed. ▪ The imagination of designers to come up with new conceptual models is limited. Identify and describe the four types of interaction. ▪ Instructing – This is where a user instructs a system and tells it what to do, for example, giving instructions to a system to print a document. o The benefit of this type of interaction is that it supports quick and efficient interaction. o Various systems were designed based on this model, for example computers, radios, TVs, etc. ▪ Conversing – This is where users would have a dialog with a system. The system acts as a dialog partner and impersonates a human being. o Currently supported through voice recognition, interactive voice response systems through phones. o The advantage of conversation model is that it allows people to interact with a system in a way that is familiar to them – talking. o The disadvantage of the model is that voice interaction can be one sided, for example, automated phone-based system that use auditory menus to advance he interaction. ▪ Manipulating – This is where users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them. The manipulation is informed by how users manipulate physical objects in real world. o Direct manipulation (DM) framework influenced the design of GUI based computers. o Advantages of DM interfaces are good learnability and memorability. ▪ Exploring – This is where users move through a virtual or a physical environment. Sensors are used in physical environments to enable people to interact with an environment, for example, fire sensors, motion sensors etc. o Virtual worlds, especially through 3D have been implemented to provide spaces for learning, play games and fantasy. P a g e 10 | 33 o The advantage of exploration model is that it provides authentic exploration of objects that may not be readily available. What is a framework? A framework is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area (e.g. collaborative learning) or analytic method (e.g. ethnographic studies). A classic early example of a conceptual framework in HCI is Norman’s (1998) explication of the relationship between the design of a conceptual model and the user’s understanding of it. The framework comprises three interacting components. Discuss each of these components. ▪ The designer’s model is the model the designer has of how the system should work. This is how the designer envisions the system working and how he/she intends that users should interact with the system. ▪ The system image is how the system actually works, and is portrayed to the user through the interface, manuals, help facilities and so on. The system image should make obvious what a user should do. ▪ The users’ model represents how the user understands how the system works, which ideally should match with what is presented in the system image and what the designer intended. Why is it important that designers consolidate the three components when designing software? In an ideal world, users should be able to carry out activities in the way intended by the designer by interacting with the system image that makes it obvious what to do. If the three components mentioned above are not consolidated properly, it can lead to a poor user experience. If the system image does not make the designer’s model clear to the users, it is likely that they will end up with an incorrect understanding of the system, which in turn will increase their chances of using the system ineffectively and making errors. By drawing attention to this potential discrepancy, designers can be made aware of the importance of trying to bridge the gap more effectively. Definitions Paradigm: Refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values and practices. P a g e 11 | 33 Vision: Future scenario that frames research and development in interaction design – often depicted in the form of a film/narrative. Theory: Well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon. Model: simplification of some aspect of HCI intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. Framework: Set of interrelated concepts and or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area, online communities or analytical method. Chapter 4 – Social Interaction Objectives The main aims of this chapter are to: • Explain what is meant by social interaction. • Describe the social mechanisms that are used by people when communicating and collaborating. • Discuss how social media have changed the ways in which we keep in touch, make contact, and manage our social and working lives. • Explain what is meant by telepresence. • Give an overview of shareable technologies and some of the studies showing how they can facilitate collaboration and group participation. Summary Human beings are inherently social; people will always need to collaborate, coordinate, and communicate with one another, and the diverse range of applications, web-based services, and technologies that have emerged are enabling them to do so in more extensive and diverse ways. In this chapter we have looked at some core aspects of sociality, namely communication and collaboration. We examined the main social mechanisms that people use in different conversational settings when interacting face-to-face and at a distance. A number of collaborative and telepresence technologies designed to support and extend these mechanisms were discussed, highlighting core interaction design concerns. Key points • Social interaction is central to our everyday life. • Social mechanisms have evolved in face-to-face and remote contexts to facilitate conversation, coordination, and awareness. • Talk and the way it is managed are integral to coordinating social interaction. • Many kinds of computer-mediated communication systems have been developed to enable people to communicate with one another when in physically different locations. • Keeping aware of what others are doing and letting others know what you are doing are important aspects of collaboration and socializing. • Social media have brought about significant changes in the way people keep in touch and manage their social lives. P a g e 12 | 33 Social interaction is central to humans’ everyday life. Describe how social media have changed the way in which people interact. (10) • People are used to face-to-face communication which allows not only talking and listening but also taking into account visual clues such as facial expressions. • The telephone overcame distance and time barriers but limited communication to audible signs. • Messaging apps allows video calls, video conferencing and texting. • These technologies lack the richness of face-to-face communication and people compensate for these constraints by talking louder, using emoticons or projecting themselves more. • Social media apps allow one-to-many broadcasting, is immediate and can be on-sided. • People switch easily between different technologies depending on the context (texting; emailing; chatting) • Messages can easily be sent to the wrong receiver. Reliability of messages can be a problem. Face to face conversation In addition when a breakdown occurs in a conversation via email, people can literally spell out what they meant, making things more clear/explicit in a subsequent email, using capitals, emoticons, exclamations, bold, highlighting, and so on. If the message is beyond repair, they may resort to another mode of communication that allows greater flexibility of expression, either telephoning or speaking to the recipient face-to-face. Remote conversation Telepresence • Telepresence technologies project people’s body movements, actions, voice and facial expressions to give the appearance that they are present in the meeting. Images of a person can be superimposed on a workspace. Remote people can appear life-like. Wearable devices could send hugs (created by transmitted buzzes, skin warmth and heart rate) to remove friends. Co-presence Shareable interfaces enable more than one person to use them at the same time to enhance co-located collaboration and gaming. • Physical coordination: voice and gestures used in face-to-face communication. P a g e 13 | 33 • Awareness: a combination of direct observation and peripheral monitoring/situational awareness facilitates interdependent teamwork. • Shareable interfaces exploit and simulate existing forms of coordination and awareness mechanisms to encourage more equitable participation in groups. Social translucence visualise social interaction and could be used to encourage people to socialise more. Physical Coordination Awareness Shareable Interfaces Chapter 5 – Emotional Interaction An overarching goal of interaction design is to develop products that elicit positive responses from users, such as feeling at ease, being comfortable, and enjoying the experience of using them. Emotions and the user experience Emotional interaction is concerned with how we feel and react when interacting with technology. It covers different aspects of the user experience from how we feel when first finding out about a new product to getting rid of it. It also looks at why people become emotionally attached to certain products, how social robots might help reduce loneliness and how to change human behaviour through the use of emotive feedback. Consider the different emotions experienced for a common everyday activity – shopping online for a product, such as a new smartphone, a washing machine or a vacation. Firstly, there is the realisation of needing or wanting it, then the desire and anticipation of purchasing it. This is followed by the joy or frustration of finding out more about what products are available and deciding which to choose. This entails matching what is available with what you like or need and whether you can afford it. The thrill of deciding on a purchase may be quickly followed by the shock of how much it costs and the disappointment that you can’t afford it. The process of having to decide again may be accompanied by annoyance as you can’t find one that is as good as your first choice. When you do eventually make a decision, you experience a sense of relief. P a g e 14 | 33 Emotional interaction is about considering what makes us happy, sad, annoyed, anxious, frustrated, motivated delirious, and so on, and using this knowledge to inform the design of different aspects of the user experience, from when we first want something to when we no longer interact with it or need to replace it. Ortony’s model of emotion and behaviour Highest level Middle level Lowest level Reflective Behavioural Visceral • Brain processes that contemplate. • Entails conscious thoughts where people generalise across events/ step back from routine and the immediate • The brain processes that control our everyday behaviour. • Where most human activities occur, e.g. well-learned routine operations such as talking, typing and driving. • Are the parts of the brain that are pre-wired to auto respond to events. • Respond rapidly, making judgements about what is good/bad, safe/dangerous, pleasure/abhorrent. It also triggers emotional responses to stimuli that are expressed through a combination of physiological and behavioural responses. Explain what are expressive, annoying and persuasive interfaces, in the context of emotional interaction. Expressive interfaces ▪ Use expressive forms like emoticons, sounds, icons and virtual agents to convey emotional states or elicit an emotional response in users. ▪ For example, a user may feel at ease and reassured that the computer is functioning correctly when seeing a smiling icon on screen while it is booting up (as was the case with the earlier Apple Mac computers). ▪ Dynamic icons and animations can convey further information about the status of a system. Use of imagery such as this can result in a more engaging and enjoyable experience. Annoying interfaces ▪ When something that should be easy to use turns out to be complex, for example, trying to switch from watching a DVD to the TV. ▪ Effort to negate this issue such as friendly agents, can also become annoying (e.g. Microsoft’s Clippy became distracting and irritating for users). P a g e 15 | 33 ▪ Interfaces, if poorly designed, can make people feel stupid, insulted or threatened to the point of being annoyed or even losing their temper. Persuasive interfaces ▪ Draw people’s attention to certain kinds of information in an attempt to change what they do or think, such as the recommendation system on Amazon, which tries to tempt you into buying something – made even easier by their one-click purchase option. A user may be persuaded to buy more than he/she originally intended to. ▪ These techniques can also be applied to non-commercial domains, such as changing behaviour related to health, safety, fitness, personal relationships, energy consumption, and learning. Discuss any five reasons that can explain user frustration with using computers. Frustration can occur if usability goals, user experience goals and good design principles haven’t been given enough attention. Frustration can be caused by the following reasons: ▪ If a system is not effective to use, in that it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do or what the user wants it to do. ▪ If a system is not efficient to use, for example, if it’s slow to respond and doesn’t work properly, or if there are too many steps for simple tasks. Or if mistakes are made, and the user has to start all over, i.e. recoverability is bad. ▪ If a system is not easy to learn – if the design principles of good visibility (easy to find the functions needed), consistency (it works in the same way in similar situations) and affordance (understanding what to do by getting clues from the interface) are neglected, making it not obvious what to do in various situations. ▪ If the system is not easy to remember how to use, it means effort to re-learn things every time the user uses it, which is frustrating, for example, having featuritis – an excessive number of possible operations and poor consistency. ▪ If the system doesn’t provide feedback about current status, or about the results or consequences of user actions, it can become confusing and frustrating. ▪ If the interface is generally overloaded with flashing animations, text and graphics, the over-use of sound effects and music and so on, it is not a pleasant user experience. Explain what is meant by persuasive technology. Technology that is designed in such a way as to influence and change the attitude or behaviour of the user by drawing their attention to certain kinds of information. E.g. a recommender system which suggests specific books, hotels, restaurants, etc. to the user based on his/her previous purchases, choices and taste. P a g e 16 | 33 Discuss how the design of a technology can change the attitude and behaviour of people. • Interactive computing systems deliberately designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviours in a predetermined way. For example, to persuade people to join good cause, give up bad habits, donate money, etc. • The study of computers as a persuasive technology is known as Captology. • The definition put emphasis on the intentionality of persuasion, which is the aim of the software designer. • Successful application of persuasive technologies has been reported in marketing, health, health, safety and environment. For example, Amazon.com uses a few of these techniques to entice people to purchase more products. Based on a user’s purchase history, browsing history and choices, and even the history of other people who bought similar products, Amazon is designed to recommend related products that are likely to interest that user. The website uses this more targeted, personalised form of ‘just-in-time’ persuasion, where the right product is shown to the right person at the right time. Additionally, their ‘one-click’ buy button is designed to make it even easier to tempt users into making an impulse purchase by taking all the effort out of the process. A product designed to monitor, and track behaviour can persuade people to change their habits or to do something that will improve their well-being. An example of this was the Pokémon Pikachu virtual pet designed for children which had a built-in pedometer. It was designed to motivate children to be physically active in order to keep the pet alive. Another example is water usage monitoring and tracking. This can be taken a step further by introducing elements of competition and recognition. With the WaterBot product, householders could be persuaded to be more conservative by being shown bar graphs near taps indicating how much water a person has used in relation to others in the household. Users would change their behaviour in order to ‘win’ by using the least water. Attitudes could be changed in this way by promoting discussion about water usage in the household. • Strategies that are employed in designing technologies in order to change people’s attitude and behaviour include: 1. Just in time persuasion 2. Simulating experience 3. Personalising 4. Recommendation 5. Monitoring and tracking 6. Competition and recognition 7. Visualising the personalities in virtual communities. • Persuasive technologies have disadvantages, especially deception. P a g e 17 | 33 • Some techniques are more subtle and persuasive on an almost sub-conscious level. For example, in designing products to promote the reduction of individuals’ carbon footprints, a conscious choice was made to simply show daily consumption figures on a device and allow the individuals to come to the right conclusion themselves. Being too forward and in your face in this case may lead people to reject the persuasion. By making the products ‘neutral’, the attitude of the user changed for the better. Another example is the use of personalisation to make a user feel welcomed and special, such as on Amazon where they are then also greeted with recommendations and the categories they’re historically most interested in, which all leads to more purchases. The recent rise of virtual reality (VR) is interesting in terms of persuasive technology. Simulation can persuade people to change their attitudes or behaviours by enabling them to immediately observe the link between cause and effect. For example, playing a game which places users in situations where their lives are in danger, such as an emergency situation on an aeroplane, can persuade them to change their behaviour in real life to avoid those same situations. Explain the term anthropomorphism and its disadvantages. Anthropomorphism is attributing human qualities to objects and has been used in interaction design to design applications that have human-like qualities A number of virtual characters and robot pets have been developed to motivate people to learn, buy, and listen. Disadvantages ▪ Make people feel inferior or anxious. ▪ Studies have shown that personalized feedback is considered to be less honest and makes users feel less responsible for their actions. ▪ Lack the ability to follow a conversation and fail to suggest appropriate help. ▪ Speech recognition systems incorrectly may translate people say. ▪ If the technology is targeted for novice users, experts may become frustrated. ▪ Giving users no control over the system frustrates users. ▪ The systems deceive users because they think that computers have all human capabilities, hence they blame them when something goes wrong. ▪ Agents cannot give some common examples that are not related to the current problem. P a g e 18 | 33 With reference to emotional interaction, compare pleasurable interfaces (and other positive design elements) with annoying interfaces (and other negative design elements). (10) Expressive forms like emoticons, sounds, icons, and virtual agents have been used at the interface to (i) convey emotional states and/or (ii) elicit certain kinds of emotional responses in users, such as feeling at ease, comfort and happiness. The design of aesthetically pleasing interfaces has become of central concern to interaction design. Empirical studies have shown that the aesthetics of an interface can have a positive effect on people’s perception of the system’s usability. When the look and feel of an interface is pleasing and pleasurable – e.g. beautiful graphics, nice feel to the way the elements have been put together, well-designed fonts, elegant use of images and colour, a good sense of balance – users are likely to be more tolerant, e.g. they may be prepared to wait a few more seconds for a website to download. Furthermore, good-looking interfaces are often more satisfying and pleasurable to use. A key concern is to strike a balance between designing for aesthetic versus usable interfaces and pleasurable versus useful one. In regard to annoying interfaces, if an interface is designed poorly, it can make people look stupid, or feel insulted or threatened. The effect can be to make them annoyed to the point of losing their temper. There are numerous situations that cause such emotional responses, they include: When an application does not work properly, or crashes; When a system does not do what the user wants it to do; When a user’s expectation is not met; When error messages pop up that are vague or obtuse; When the appearance of an interface is too noisy, garish, gimmicky, or patronizing; Websites that are overloaded with text and graphics, making it difficult to find the information desired and making them slow to access; Flashing animations, especially flashing banner ads and pop-up ads that cover what the user is looking at which require them to actively click on a check box to close them; The over-use of sound effects and music, especially when selecting options, carrying out actions, running tutorials, or watching website demos. Chapter 7 – Data Gathering What are the five key issues that determine the success of a data gathering exercise? 1. Setting goals – The type of information required after gathering the data needs to be clear. What is it that you want to know? Specific goals should be set about what data is required since it will affect the gathering techniques used and the analysis to be performed on the data. 2. Identifying participants – The goals that are set will help you identify the kind of people you will need to gather data from. From this group, depending how large it is, a smaller P a g e 19 | 33 group will either be randomly selected (a deciding factor is whether you need to apply statistical tests for a population) or chosen based on convenience and availability of volunteers. 3. Relationship with participants – The relationship between the people doing the gathering and the people providing the data needs to be clear and professional. Typically, participants will sign an informed consent form explaining the purpose of the data gathering, how the data will be used, and assurance that they may withdraw at any time. 4. Triangulation – This technique is useful for validating the results of some inquiry by using more than one data gathering or data analysis technique to arrive at similar results from different perspectives, thereby confirming, in a way, the results. In practice, this is very difficult to achieve, however. 5. Pilot studies – Perform a small trial run of the main study. In doing so, you can make sure that the proposed method is viable before starting the real study. Potential problems can be identified and corrected in advance, making it more likely that the real study will be successful. What is the goal of your data gathering session (e-reader example)? The goal is to collect sufficient, relevant, and appropriate data depending on what we want to know. In this case, we want to know if young people under 18 are interested in a new type of e-reader we want to develop. List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the interview. ▪ The interviewer can take notes and photographs of the interview. Taking notes is the least technical and most flexible way of recording data, and photographs of artefacts can be used to supplement notes. ▪ The interviewee can be recorded with an audio recording device and photographs can supplement the audio content if required. Audio recording is a good alternative to note taking and less intrusive than video. ▪ The interviewee can be recorded on video with a camera. May require more than one camera in different locations to capture all that is required. P a g e 20 | 33 Discuss any three disadvantages of taking notes during the interview. ▪ It can be difficult and tiring to write and listen or observe at the same time. It’s easier for the interviewer to lose concentration while their focus is on writing or typing rather than on the interviewee’s thoughts and comments. ▪ Handwriting can be difficult to decipher after the fact. ▪ Speed of writing or typing is limited, and important information may be missed. Discuss what should be avoided when designing interview questions. ▪ The questions should not be ambiguous. ▪ Avoid emotional language. ▪ Jargon or complex language should be avoided. ▪ Avoid leading questions. ▪ Avoid bias. ▪ Ask question one at a time. ▪ Avoid questions that require a response of a simple yes or no answer. ▪ Interview questions should follow some order. Do not ask abrupt questions. ▪ Avoid questions that are not related to interview goals. ▪ The type of data recording should not interfere with the interview proceeding. Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals. ▪ How would you say the experience of using an e-reader is better than the traditional alternatives? ▪ What do you find engaging and enjoyable about using an e-reader? ▪ What do you find frustrating about using an e-reader? Name and describe the types of interview methods. Unstructured (open-ended) interviews ▪ Exploratory and more like conversations ▪ No particular expectation about the format or content of answers ▪ Benefits: o Generates rich data that gives a deep understanding of topic. o Unconsidered issues may be revealed. Structured interviews ▪ Predetermined questions, same questions for each participant. ▪ Typically closed questions. ▪ Useful when the goals are clearly understood. P a g e 21 | 33 Semi-structured interviews ▪ Uses both closed and open-ended questions. ▪ Basic script for guidance so that same topics are covered for all participants, but question could take different paths based on participants responses and interviewer’s probing. Chapter 9 – The process of Interaction Design The importance of involving users • The best way to ensure that development continues to take users’ activities into account, is to involve real users throughout development. • Developers can gain a better understanding of users’ goals, leading to a more appropriate, more usable product. • The purpose of expectation management is to ensure that there are no surprises for users when the product arrives. • Involving users throughout development helps with expectation management because they can see from an early stage what the product’s capabilities are. • Adequate and timely training is another technique for managing expectations. • A reason for user involvement is ownership. Users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product’s development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership towards it and support its use. In a user-centred approach, what are the three principles laid down by Gould and Lewis that they believed would lead to a ‘useful and easy to use computer system’? 1. Early focus on users and tasks – this means first understanding who the users will be by directly studying their cognitive, behavioural, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics. This requires observing users doing their normal tasks, studying the nature of those tasks and then involving users in the design process. 2. Empirical measurement - Early in development, the reactions and performance of intended users to printed scenarios, manuals, etc., are observed and measured. Later on, users interact with simulations and prototypes and their performance and reactions are observed, recorded, and analysed. 3. Iterative design – When problems are found in user testing, they are fixed and then more tests and observations are carried out to see the effects of the fixes. This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of design-test-measure-redesign being repeated as often as necessary. P a g e 22 | 33 When following a user-centred approach in interactive design, there is a principle of ‘focus on users and tasks early’. Name and explain five sub-principles that explain the meaning of the above statement. 1. Users’ tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development – In a user-centred approach, technology will inform the design options, but the users’ goals will inform the choice that supports them best. 2. Users’ behaviour and context of use are studied, and the system is designed to support them – How people perform their tasks – understanding their priorities, preferences and intentions – is significant. 3. Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for – Products designed for humans should take into account our cognitive (such as attention, memory, perception issues) and physical (height, strength, mobility) limitations. 4. Users are consulted throughout the development process from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account. It’s important that users are respected by designers. 5. All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment – This doesn’t mean that users make the decisions. As long as designers remain aware of users while making decisions, this principle will be upheld. What is the importance of involving users during the design of a computer information system? ▪ Improved quality of the system arising from a more accurate capture of user requirements, this is because they use the system every day or on daily basis. ▪ To avoid incorporation of costly system features that users would not want to use or cannot use. ▪ To provide users with a system that meets their real expectations. ▪ To ensure that users do not encounter surprises when the new system is delivered. ▪ Greater understanding of the system by the users results in more effective use. Users can see from early stages of software development what the capabilities of the system are. ▪ If users are involved, they will have chance to work with the product before it is released, and they will have a better understanding of what to expect on the new system. ▪ Increased participation in decision making within software development cycle increases ownership of the system by the users. Users who were involved feel that they have contributed to a product’s development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership. P a g e 23 | 33 Four Basic Activities of Interaction Design p330 ▪ Establishing Requirements – Know who target users are and what kind of support an interactive product could usefully provide. These needs form the basis of the product’s requirements and underpin subsequent design and development. Est requirements is fundamental to a user-centered approach and very important in interaction design. Understanding the needs is established through data gathering and analysis. ▪ Designing Alternatives – This is the core activity of designing and actually involves suggesting ideas for meeting the requirements. It can be viewed as 2 sub-activities: conceptual and concrete design. Conceptual design involves producing the conceptual model for the product and a conceptual model describes an abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Concrete design considers the detail of the product including the colours, sounds, and images to use, menu design, and icon design. Alternatives are considered at every point. ▪ Prototyping – Interaction design involves designing interactive products. Most sensible way for users to evaluate such designs is to interact with it, and this can be achieved through prototyping. Different prototyping techniques exist, but not all require a working piece of software. ▪ Evaluating – This is the process of determining the usability and acceptability of the product or design that is measured in terms of a variety of usability and user experience criteria. Interaction design requires a high level of user involvement throughout development, and this enhances the chances of an acceptable product being delivered. Evaluation does not replace the activities concerned with quality assurance and testing to make sure that the final product is fit for purpose, but it complements and enhances then. Briefly discuss how you would involve users during the design of a computer information system. As a member of the design team: ▪ Full time: constant input, but lose touch with other users. ▪ Part time: patchy input, can be very stressful. ▪ Short term: inconsistent across project life. ▪ Long term: consistent, but lose touch with users. Via newsletters and other dissemination devices: ▪ Can reach wider selection of users. ▪ Need communication both ways. ▪ User involvement after product is released. ▪ Combination of these approaches. P a g e 24 | 33 Chapter 10 – Establishing Requirements Describe different kinds of requirements There are two different kinds of requirements. Functional and Non-functional. Functional requirements capture what products can do. Non-functional requirements say what constraints there are on the system and its development Data Requirements: Capture type, volatility, size/amount, accuracy and value of required data. Environmental Requirements: Refer to circumstances in what the interactive product will operate. There are four aspects of environmental requirements that must be considered when establishing requirements. 1. Physical Environment: such as how much lighting, noise, movement, and dust is expected in operational environment. 2. Social Environment: e.g. collaboration and coordination to be expected. 3. Organisational Environment, e.g. how good is the user support likely to be, and how easily can it be obtained. 4. Technical Environment to be established User Characteristics: capture the key attributes of intended user group and the abilities and skills. Other characteristics that may affect the design are: user’s nationality, educational background, preferences, person circumstances, physical/mental disabilities, and so on. Usability goals and user experience goals: These are another kind of requirement, and should be captured together with appropriate measures. Usability should be given due priority and can facilitate progress tracking. Data gathering techniques The overall purpose of data gathering in the requirements activity is to collect sufficient, relevant, and appropriate data so that a set of stable requirements can be produced. Data gathering needs to cover a wide spectrum of issues: The tasks that users currently perform and their associated goals, the context in which the task are performed, and the rationale for the current situation. Interviews: Are good for exploring issues, and semi-structured or unstructured interviews are often used early on to elicit scenarios. Equally important for development team members to meet stakeholders and for users to feel involved. Focus Groups: Are good for gaining a consensus view and highlighting areas of conflict and disagreement during the requirements activity. P a g e 25 | 33 Questionnaires: May be used for getting initial responses that can then be analysed to choose people to interview or get a wider perspective on particular issues that have arisen elsewhere. Direct Observation: In the requirements activity, observation of participants in their natural setting is used to understand the nature of the tasks and the context in which they are performed. Indirect Observation: Diaries and interaction logging are used less often within the requirements activity where a new product is under development. Studying Documentation: Manuals and other documentation are a good source of data about the steps involved in an activity and any regulations governing a task. Data gathering Guidelines 1. Focus on identifying the stakeholders’ needs. 2. Involve all the stakeholder groups 3. Involving only one representative from each stakeholder group is not enough, especially if the group is large. 4. Support the data gathering session with suitable props, such as task descriptions and prototypes if available. P a g e 26 | 33 Brainstorming for innovation For requirements, two key success factors are firstly that the participants should know the users’ goals that the product is to support, and secondly that no ideas should be criticized or debated. 1. Include participants from a wide range of disciplines, with a broad range of experience; 2. Don’t ban silly stuff. Wild ideas often turn into really useful requirements; 3. Use catalysts for further inspiration. Build one idea on top of another; 4. Keep records. Every idea should be captured without censoring; 5. Sharpen the focus. Start the brainstorm with a well-honed problem; 6. Use warm-up exercises and make the session fun. The group will require warming up if they have not worked together before. Task Analysis Is used mainly to investigate an existing situation, not to envision new products. It is used to analyse the underlying rationale and purpose of what people are doing: what are they trying to achieve, why are they trying to achieve it and how are they going about it? The info gleaned from task analysis establishes a foundation of existing practices on which to build new requirements or design new tasks. Hierarchical Task Analysis [HTA] Involves breaking a task down into subtasks and then into sub-sub-tasks and so on. There are two main problems with using HTA on real problems: 1. Real tasks are very complex, and task analysis does not scale very well. 2. Task analysis is limited in the kinds of task it can model. E.g. it cannot model tasks that are overlapping, or in parallel, nor can it model interruptions. Benefits of task analysis include: 1. It lets you objectively compare alternative designs, based on a user’s planned tasks and subtasks. 2. It provides a good understanding of the interaction at whichever level of abstraction is appropriate. This facilitates good design. 3. It supports design reuse – again at different levels of abstraction. Chapter 11 – Conceptual Design Conceptual design is concerned with transforming requirements into a conceptual model. Designing the conceptual model is fundamental to interaction design, yet the idea of a conceptual model can be difficult to grasp. P a g e 27 | 33 A conceptual model is an outline of what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Interface metaphors – combine familiar knowledge with new knowledge in a way that will help a user understand the product. Erickson (1990) suggest a three step process for choosing a good interface metaphor. 1. Understand what the system will do, i.e. identifying the functional requirements. 2. Understand which bits of the product are likely to cause users problems, i.e. which tasks or subtasks cause problems, are complicated or are critical. 3. Generate metaphors. Looking for metaphors in the users’ description of the tasks is good starting point. Chapter 13 – Evaluation Studies Describe the three broad categories of evaluation. 1. Controlled settings involving users – e.g. labs and living labs. Users’ activities are controlled in order to test hypotheses and measure or observe certain behaviours. The main methods are usability testing and experiments. 2. Natural settings involving users – e.g. online communities and products for public places. There is little or no control of users’ activities in order to determine how the product would be used in the real world. The main method used is field studies. 3. Any settings not involving users – consultants and researchers’ critique, predict, and model aspects of the interface in order to identify the most obvious usability problems. The range of methods includes inspections, heuristics, walkthroughs, models, and analytics. Compare laboratory usability testing and field studies under the following headings: ** The environment in which the testing is conducted: In laboratory usability testing, the environment and user activity are controlled in order to test hypotheses and measure or observe certain behaviour. There may be a list of tasks and operations for the users to try out in order to get a complete evaluation of the product features. In field studies, there is little or no control of users’ activities in order to determine how the product would be used in natural settings in the real world. It is messy in the sense that activities tend to overlap and there are constant interruptions. P a g e 28 | 33 ** The participants: In both settings, appropriate groups of typical users from the target audience would participate in the evaluation, i.e. the users for whom the system is designed. In lab-based studies, the participants would be brought into the lab separately and asked to perform predefined tasks. Field studies may be short or take place over months, in a natural environment where it is up to the participants to decide how to use the product and when. ** Data collection: In usability testing data is collected from conducting experiments for certain predefined scenarios through observation of participants. They may be recorded on video and audio as they perform tasks. Data captured includes facial expressions and body language. Participants may be asked to speak out loud so that what they are thinking, and planning can be revealed and recorded. Interactions with the software may also be recorded by logging software, such as keystroke loggers and mouse movements recorders. After the session, structured or semi-structured interviews are conducted to elicit participants’ opinions about how they found the experience. Questionnaires are also used, where participants can rate things along a number of scales. In field studies, data is collected about how the product is being used in work or other environments. Data is in the form of events and conversations, recorded by researchers as notes and audio or video recordings, or by participants as diaries and notes. Some examples include recording the frequency of daily activities, such as eating and drinking habits, or social interactions like phone and face-to-face conversations. Software running on smartphones could trigger messages to participants at certain intervals, requesting them to answer or fill out forms and checklists. Data can also be recorded from intermittent interviews with participants. ** Advantages and disadvantages: ▪ Lab-based studies are good at revealing usability problems. You can ensure that all the tasks and operations in the product are evaluated because of the degree of control, while in field studies, the participants may not try out the full range of functions in the product. ▪ Lab-based studies enable evaluators to reduce outside influences and distractions, such as colleagues or friends talking, so that the findings are reliable. ▪ Field studies are expensive and difficult to conduct but are good at demonstrating how people use technologies in their intended setting, while lab-based studies are poor at capturing context of use. P a g e 29 | 33 ▪ The downside of handing over control in field studies is that it makes it difficult to anticipate what is going to happen and to be present when something interesting does happen. This is in contrast to usability testing where there is always an investigator or camera at hand to record events. ▪ A potential advantage of field studies is that is that unexpected data can be obtained that provides different insights into people’s perception and experience with the product. ▪ In lab-based studies, specific hypotheses can be reliably tested and measured, however with field studies they cannot be tested with the same degree of certainty. Chapter 13 – Evaluation Studies Usability Testing The goal is to test whether the product being developed is usable by the intended user Types of Evaluation 1. Controlled settings involving users 2. Natural settings involving users 3. Any settings not involving users. Chapter 14 – Evaluation Studies: From Controlled to natural settings Usability Testing The goal is to test whether the product being developed is usable by the intended user population to achieve the tasks for which it was designed. Also, the acceptable number of users that should be involved in a usability study is between 5 – 12. Usability testing takes place in usability labs or temporary makeshift labs. These labs enable evaluators to control the test setting. Usability testing focuses on performance measures such as as how long and how many errors are made, when completing a set of predefined tasks. Indirect observation is conducted and supplemented by user satisfaction questionnaires and interviews. Remote testing systems have been developed that are more affordable than usability labs and also more portable. P a g e 30 | 33 Field studies are evaluation studies that are carried out in natural settings. They aim to discover how people interact with technology in the real world. Field studies that involve the deployment of prototypes or technologies in natural settings may also be referred to as in the wild. Labs and Equipment Usability labs can be very expensive and labour-intensive to run and maintain. Modifications would need to be made to these labs on a regular basis when new products or systems are tested, and can be time-consuming. Chapter 15 – Evaluation: Inspections, Analytics and Models What is heuristic evaluation? Heuristic evaluation is an informal usability inspection technique developed by Nielsen and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure or online help conform to the principles. What is Jakob Nielsen’s original set of heuristics for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) evaluation? 1. Visibility of system status – The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 2. Match between system and the real world – The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 3. User control and freedom – Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog. Support undo and redo. 4. Consistency and standards – Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. 5. Error prevention – Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. P a g e 31 | 33 6. Recognition rather than recall – Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialog to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use – Accelerators – unseen by the novice user – may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design – Dialogs should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialog competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors – Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. 10. Help and documentation – Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. If these are too general, Nielsen suggests developing category specific heuristics. Consider the following design guidelines and for each suggest a question that could be used in heuristics evaluation. Good graphical design is important. Reading long sentences and paragraphs is difficult on the screen, so break material into discrete, meaningful chunks to give the website a structure. Is the page layout structured meaningfully? Is there too much text on each page? Avoid excessive use of colour. Colour is useful for indicating different kinds of information. How is colour used? Is it used as a form of coding? Is it used to make the site bright and cheerful? Is it excessive and garish? Does it have an impact on the user’s enjoyment? Avoid excessive use of graphics. Are there any flashing banners? Are there complex introduction sequences? Do the graphics add to the site and improve the user’s experience? Download time for smartphone applications must be short. Is all the content really needed? Can versions be provided that are quick to download? Schneiderman’s eight golden rules are used as heuristics for identifying usability problems. List the rules and briefly describe. 1. Strive for consistency – Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations: identical terminology, consistent colour, layout, fonts etc. should be employed throughout. Exceptions should be limited. P a g e 32 | 33 2. Cater to universal usability – Recognise the needs of diverse users. Design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Think about the different skill levels of users, from novice to expert, their age ranges, disabilities and technological diversity. Each of these factors enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices such as explanations, and features for experts, such as short-cuts and faster pacing, can enrich the interface design and improve perceived system quality. 3. Offer informative feedback – For every user action, there should be system feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can be modest, for example, having an informational message appear somewhere on screen and then fade away, whereas for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial, like a modal pop- up with a warning message. Visual presentation of the objects of interest provides a convenient environment for showing changes explicitly. 4. Design dialogs to yield closure – Sequences of actions should be organised into groups with a beginning, middle and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, and indicates to prepare for the next group of actions. 5. Prevent errors – As much as possible, design a system such that users cannot make serious errors; e.g. grey out menu items that are not appropriate. The interface should detect errors and offer simple instructions for recovery. 6. Permit easy reversal of actions – As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data- entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name-address block. 7. Support internal locus of control – Experienced users need the sense that they are in charge of the interface. No surprises and no annoyances or difficulties obtaining the desired results. 8. Reduce short-term memory load – Humans limited capacity for information processing in short-term memory required that designers avoid interfaces in which users must remember and use information across different screens. Briefly discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation. ▪ The briefing sessions where the experts are told what to do. A prepared script is useful as a guide and to ensure each person receives the same briefing. ▪ The evaluation period, where each expert typically spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. They will take at least two passes through the interface, to get a feel for the product’s flow and scope, and then to focus on specific interface elements and identify potential usability problems. P a g e 33 | 33 ▪ The debriefing session, in which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings and to prioritise the problems they found and suggest solutions. Heuristic Evaluation for websites ▪ Clarity – make the system as clear, concise, and meaningful as possible for the intended audience. ▪ Minimize unnecessary complexity and cognitive load – Make the system as simple as possible for users to accomplish their tasks. ▪ Provide users with context – Interfaces should provide users with a sense of context in time and space. ▪ Promote a pleasurable and positive user experience – The user should be treated with respect and design should be aesthetically pleasing and promote a pleasurable and rewarding experience. Predictive Models Rather than involving expert evaluators role-playing users as in inspections, or tracking their behaviour as in analytics, predictive models use formulas to derive various measures of user performance. Cognitive Walkthrough Involve simulating a user’s problem-solving process. The steps are: 1. Characteristics of typical users are identified and documented, and sample tasks are developed that focus on the aspects of the design to be evaluated. 2. A designer and one or more expert evaluators come together to do the analysis. 3. Evaluators walk through action sequences for each task, placing it within the context of a typical scenario, and as they do this, they try to answer the following questions: a. Will the user know what to do to achieve the task? b. Will the user notice that the correct action is available? c. Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly? 4. As walkthrough is being done, a record of critical information is compiled in which: a. The assumptions about what would cause problems and why are identified b. Notes about side issues and design changes are made c. A summary of the results is compiled. 5. The design is then revised to fix the problems.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
