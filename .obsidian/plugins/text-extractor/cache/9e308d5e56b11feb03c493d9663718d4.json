The School of Computing (SoC) have a small library, which is not associated with the university’s main library. The SoC library has a collection of Information Systems and Computer Science textbooks and journals. The library uses an Excel spreadsheet to manage the library. The challenge is that borrowers return books late or don't return them. The borrowers include students and all School of Computing staff. You have been approached by the SoC to design a system that will help with library management, making sure that late returns and non-returned books are tracked.
