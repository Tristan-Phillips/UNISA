Marks are awarded according to the number of correct answers provided by the student. For each of the statement below indicate whether it is true or false. 1. The Database management system (DBMS) guarantees that the semantic meaning of a transaction truly represents the real-world event. True False 2. The information stored in the data dictionary is used by the DBMS for a recovery requirement triggered by a ROLLBACK statement, a program's abnormal termination, or a system failure such as a network discrepancy or a disk crash. True False 3. Fine-tuning the performance of a system requires a holistic approach - meaning that all factors must be checked to ensure that each one operates at its optimum level and has sufficient resources to minimize the occurrence of bottlenecks. True False Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 4. A DBA determines the initial size of the data files that make up the database; however, as required, the data files can automatically expand in predefined increments of extents. True False 5. Having a knowledge of column sparsity helps decide whether the use of an index is appropriate. True False 6. Distributed DBMS must handle some of the necessary functions imposed by the distribution of data and processing, and it must perform those additional functions transparently to the end user. True False 7. Database management systems (DBMSs) must have validation, transformation, and mapping functions, as well as other functions, in order to be classified as distributed. True False A centralized database management is subject to a problem like growing numbers of remote locations. True False Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 9. A data store is used by data analysts to create queries that access the database. True False 10. The main goal of master data management is to provide a partial and segmented definition of all data within an organisation. True False 11. Relational data warehouses use the star schema design technique to handle multidimensional data. True False 12. A data warehouse designer must define common business dimensions that will be used by a data analyst to expand a search. True False 13. In business intelligence framework, data are captured from a production system and placed in data warehouse on a near real- time basis. True False 14. Having a web-based database interface eliminates the design and implementation issues of a database systems. Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 True False 15. Whether you purchase online or by standing in line, the system- level transaction details are essentially the same, and they require the same basic database structures and relationships. True False 16. The effects of bad database design, implementation, and management are magnified in an environment in which the number of transactions is less than one hundred. True False The label “stateless system” indicates that, at any given time, there is an open communication line between the server and each client accessing it. True False 18. Backups must be clearly identified through detailed descriptions and date information, assuring that the correct backup is used to recover the database. True False 19. The DBA function provides data modeling and design services to the end-user community, often through coordination with an application development group within the data-processing department. True Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 False 20. When introducing a database into an organization, the database approach creates a more controlled and structured information flow and thus affects people, functions, and interactions which leads to a cultural impact of the new database system.
