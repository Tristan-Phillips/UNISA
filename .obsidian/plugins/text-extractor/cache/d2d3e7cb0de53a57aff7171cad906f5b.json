Thinking humanly: Cognitive Science • The field of cognitive science brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to construct precise and testable theories of the human mind. • Requires scientific theories of internal activities of the brain • What level of abstraction? Knowledge or Circuits? • How to validate? Requires: 1) Predicting and testing behavior of human subjects (top-down), or 2) Direct identification from neurological data (bottom-up) • Both approaches (Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience) are now distinct from AI. • Both share with AI the following characteristic: the available theories do not explain anything resembling human-level general intelligence Thinking rationally: Laws of Thought • Aristotle: what are correct arguments/thought processes? • Development of various forms of logic: • notation and rules of derivation for thoughts. • may or may not have proceeded to the idea of mechanization • Direct line through mathematics and philosophy to modern AI • Main obstacles to this approach. • First, it is not easy to take informal knowledge and state it in the formal terms required by logical notation, particularly when the knowledge is less than 100% certain. • Second, there is a big difference between solving a problem “in principle” and solving it in practice. Acting rationally: The rational agent approach • An agent is just something that acts. • A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome. • In the “laws of thought” approach to AI, the emphasis was on correct inferences. • Making correct inferences is sometimes part of being a rational agent, and • There are also ways of acting rationally that cannot involve inference. • Rational behavior: doing the right thing • The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information • Doing the right thing doesn't necessarily always involve thinking but thinking should be in the service of rational action Acting rationally: Rational agents • An agent is an entity that perceives and acts • This AI course concentrates on general principles of rational agents and on components for constructing them. • Abstractly, an agent is a function from percept histories to actions: f : P* → A • For any given class of environments and tasks, we seek the agent (or class of agents) with the best performance. • Computational limitations can make perfect rationality unachievable  Design best program for given machine resources Foundations of AI • Many disciplines contribute to a foundation for artificial intelligence. • Philosophy: logic, methods of reasoning, mind as physical system • Mathematics: formal representation and proof, algorithms, computation, decidability, probability • Psychology: phenomena of perception and motor control • Economics: formal theory of rational decisions • Linguistics: knowledge representation, grammar • Neuroscience: how the brain works • Computer engineers provided powerful machines that make AI applications possible. • Control theory: designing devices that act optimally on the basis of feedback from the environment History of Artificial Intelligence 1943 McCulloch & Pitts: Boolean circuit model of brain • The first work that is now generally recognized as AI. 1950 Turing's “Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" • Turing introduced the Turing Test, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. 1950s Early AI programs: • Samuel's checkers program, Newell & Simon's Logic Theorist 1956 Dartmouth meeting: Birth of “Artificial Intelligence\" • McCarthy, Minsky and others come together to study artificial intelligence. 1958 McCarthy defined the high-level language Lisp, • Lisp was to become the dominant AI programming language 1965 Robinson’s discovery of the resolution method • a complete theorem-proving algorithm for first-order logic History of Artificial Intelligence 1966-74 AI discovers computational complexity • Neural network research almost disappears 1969-79 Early development of knowledge-based systems 1980-88 Expert systems industry booms 1985-95 Neural networks return to popularity 1987- AI adopts the scientific method • Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Bayesian network formalism for uncertainty, data mining 2001- Availability of very large data sets The State of The Art • What can AI do today? • Robotic vehicles: driverless robotic cars • Speech recognition • Autonomous planning and scheduling: NASA’s Remote Agent program became the first on-board autonomous planning program to control the scheduling of operations for a spacecraft • Game playing: IBM’s DEEP BLUE became the first computer program to defeat the world champion in a chess match • Spam fighting • Robotics • Machine Translation","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
