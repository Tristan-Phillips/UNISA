What is the purpose of the requirements activity? • Explore the problem space • Establish a description of what will be developed How to capture requirements once discovered • In prototypes or operational product • Through structured or rigorous notations • Different capturing mechanisms emphasise and de- emphasise different aspects www.id-book.com 3 Why bother? Requirements activity is the stage where mis- communication occurs most commonly www.id-book.com 4 What are requirements? • A statement about an intended product that specifies what it is expected to do or how it will perform • Different forms and different levels of abstraction • User stories (most prevalent in agile development contexts) • Format: As a <role>, I want <behaviour> so that <benefit> • Example user stories for a travel organizer might be: As a <traveler>, I want <to save my favourite airline for all my flights> so that <I will be able to collect air miles> As a <travel agent>, I want <my special discount rates to be displayed to me> so that <I can offer my clients competitive rates> www.id-book.com 5 Volere shell www.id-book.com 6 The 7 product dimensions www.id-book.com 7 Source: Gottesdiener and Gorman (2012), p.58. Used courtesy of Ellen Gottesdiener Different kinds of requirements • Functional: ⎻ What the system should do • Data: ⎻ What kinds of data need to be stored? ⎻ How will they be stored (e.g. database)? www.id-book.com 8 Different kinds of requirements • Environment or context of use: • physical: dusty? noisy? vibration? light? heat? humidity? …. (e.g. in a hospital) • social: collaboration and co-ordination, data sharing, distributed, synchronous or asynchronous, privacy • organisational: user support, communications structure and infrastructure, availability of training • technical: what technologies will it run on or need to be compatible with? www.id-book.com 9 Different kinds of requirements Users: Who are they? • Characteristics: nationality, educational background, attitude to computers • System use: novice, expert, casual, frequent ⎻ Novice: prompted, constrained, clear ⎻ Expert: flexibility, access/power ⎻ Frequent: short cuts ⎻ Casual/infrequent: clear menu paths • User profile www.id-book.com 10 Different kinds of requirements • Usability goals • User experience goals • Different products have different requirements and may be implemented in different ways, e.g. trustworthiness www.id-book.com 11 Usable security www.id-book.com 12 How to make security robust without detracting from user experience • if the usability of security is ignored then security mechanisms will be circumvented • passwords as an example ⎻ too much advice about how to choose a password ⎻ coping strategies may compromise security Data gathering for requirements • Interviews, observation and questionnaires • Studying documentation: – Procedures and rules are often written down in manuals – Good source of data about the steps involved in an activity, and any regulations governing a task – Not to be used in isolation – Good for understanding legislation, and getting background information – No stakeholder time, which is a limiting factor for other techniques • Researching similar products: – Good for prompting requirements www.id-book.com 13 Combining data gathering Direct observation, indirect observation, interviews, diaries and surveys www.id-book.com 14 Source: Hollis et al (2017), Figure 1. Used courtesy of Taylor & Francis Combining data gathering • Diaries and interviews: multiple information devices • Interviews, think aloud evaluation, questionnaire, evaluation of working prototype: memory aid for traumatic brain injury • Studying documentation, evaluating other systems, user observation and group interviews: ship’s maneuvering system • Ethnographic study, interviews, usability tests and user participation: tabletop user interface for genomic data www.id-book.com 15 Using probes to engage with users www.id-book.com 16 • Many types of probe: – Designed to prompt users into action – For researchers to learn about users • Cultural probe: – Wallet containing postcards, maps, camera, photo album and diary – Participants asked to answer questions using wallet contents • Design probe: – Form relates specifically to particular question and context, e.g. Top Trumps probe Source: Wallace et al (2013) Figure 6. Reproduced with permission of ACM Publications Using probes to engage with users www.id-book.com 17 • Technology probe: – Toolkits, mobile phone apps, sensor-based monitoring, e.g. M-Kulinda to alert participants about unexpected movement at home. • Provocative probe: – Technology probe designed to challenge norms and attitudes, e.g. The Box to challenge domestic laundry practices Source: Raptis et al (2017). Reproduced with permission of ACM Publications • Part of Contextual Design but also used on its own to gather requirements • One-on-one field interviews (contextual interviews) – 1.5 to 2 hours long – focus on daily life at home or work relevant to the project – uses a model of master (participant) and apprentice (researcher) • Four main principles: – Context: going to the user, wherever they are and seeing what they do as they do it – Partnership: user and interviewer explore user’s life together – Interpretation: observations interpreted by user and interviewer together – Focus: project focus to understand what to pay attention to www.id-book.com 18 Contextual Inqiury • Interview guided by “cool concepts” divided into two groups • Joy of life concepts: – How products make our lives richer and more fulfilling – Accomplish, connection, identity and sensation • Joy of use concepts: – Describe impact of using the product – Direct in action, the hassle factor and the learning delta • Interview in four parts – Overview, transition, main interview and wrap-up • Following interview, interpretation session – Contextual design models are created or consolidated – Most relevant models are chosen by team, out of 10 suggested www.id-book.com 19 Contextual Inquiry • Include participants from a wide range of disciplines, with a broad range of experience • Don't ban silly stuff • Use catalysts for further inspiration • Keep records. Capture every idea, without censoring • Sharpen the focus • Use warm-up exercises and make the session fun www.id-book.com 20 Brainstorming for innovationBringing requirements to life • Augmenting the basic requirements expressed as stories or in Volere template or other form • Personas – Rich descriptions of typical users, not specific people • Scenarios – An informal narrative story, simple, ‘natural’, personal, not generalisable www.id-book.com 21 Personas • Capture a set of user characteristics (user profile) • Synthesised from real people based on user research • Typical, not idealised • Bring to life with name, characteristics, goals, personal background – relevant to product under development • Good persona helps designer with design decisions and reminds team about who will use the product • Develop a small set of personas with one primary www.id-book.com 22 Example Persona www.id-book.com 23 Example Persona www.id-book.com 24Developed using xtensio.com/templates Scenario for group travel organizer “The Thomson family enjoy outdoor activities and want to try their hand at sailing this year. There are four family members: Sky (8 years old), Eamonn (12 years old), Claire (32), and Will (35). One evening after dinner they decide to start exploring the possibilities. They want to discuss the options together but Claire has to visit her elderly mother so will be joining the conversation from her mother’s house down the road. As a starting point, Will enters an idea they had been discussing over dinner– a sailing trip for four novices in the Mediterranean. The system supports users to log on from different locations and use different devices so that all members of the family can interact easily and comfortably with it wherever they are. The system's initial suggestion is a flotilla, where several crews (with various levels of experience) sail together on separate boats. Sky and Eamonn aren't very happy at the idea of going on vacation with a group of other people, even though the Thomsons would have their own boat. The travel organizer shows them descriptions of flotillas from other children their ages and they are all very positive, so eventually, everyone agrees to explore flotilla opportunities. Will confirms this recommendation and asks for detailed options. As it's getting late, he asks for the details to be saved so everyone can consider them tomorrow. The travel organizer emails them a summary of the different options available.” www.id-book.com 25 Scenarios • May be textual descriptions, animations, audio or video • Example animation scenarios www.id-book.com 26 Source: Keirnan et al (2015), Figure 1. Reproduced with permission of ACM Publications Scenarios and Personas www.id-book.com 27 Design fiction www.id-book.com 28 • Communicate a vision with future technologies • Fictional world in which ethics, emotions and context can be explored without concrete constraints • Examples: – Privacy and surveillance – Exploring ethics • Scenarios are about “overcoming the monster” while design fiction is about “quest” Use Cases www.id-book.com 29 • Focus on functional requirements and capture interaction • Can be used in design or to capture requirements • Use cases are step-by-step description of interactions • Two styles: – Essential use cases: division of tasks, no implementation detail – Use case with normal and alternative courses: more detail Example essential use case for travel organizer retrieveVisa USER INTENTION SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITY find visa requirements request destination and nationality supply required information obtain appropriate visa info obtain copy of visa info offer info in different formats choose suitable format provide info in chosen format www.id-book.com 30 Note that the user intention and system responsibility are offset vertically, showing a sequence of interactions Use case for travel organizer 1.
