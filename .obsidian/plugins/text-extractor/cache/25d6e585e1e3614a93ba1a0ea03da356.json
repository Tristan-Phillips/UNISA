In response to this charter, we have placed curriculum transformation high on the teaching and learning agenda. Curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both programme and module levels as a phased- in approach. You will notice a marked change in the teaching and learning strategy implemented by Unisa, together with how the content is conceptualised in your modules. We encourage you to embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa in a responsive way within the framework of transformation. 4 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 4.1 Lecturer(s) The details of the lecturer for this module would be made available on myUnisa welcome page.

This is also true for first-time students to Unisa. Unisa is a dedicated open distance and e-learning institution. Unlike face-to-face/contact institutions, Unisa is somewhat different. It is a mega university and all our programmes are offered through a blended learning mode or fully online learning mode. It is for this reason that we thought it necessary to offer first-time students additional/extended support so that you can seamlessly navigate the Unisa teaching and learning journey with little difficulty and few barriers. In this regard we offer a specialised student support programme to students entering Unisa for the first time. We refer to this programme as Unisa’s First-Year Experience (FYE) Programme. The FYE is designed to provide you with prompt and helpful information about services that the institution offers and how you can access information. The following FYE programmes are currently offered: • FYE website: All the guides and resources you need to navigate through your first year at Unisa can be accessed using the following link: www.unisa.ac.za/FYE • FYE e-mails: You will receive regular e-mails to help you stay focused and motivated. • FYE broadcasts: You will receive e-mails with links to broadcasts on various topics related to your first-year studies (eg videos on how to submit assignments online). • FYE mailbox: For assistance with queries related to your first year of study, send an e-mail to fye@unisa.ac.za INF3703/101/0/2022 11 7. HOW TO STUDY ONLINE 7.1 What does it mean to study fully online? Studying fully online modules differs completely from studying some of your other modules at Unisa. • All your study material and learning activities for online modules are designed to be delivered online on myUnisa. • All your assignments must be submitted online. This means that you will do all your activities and submit all your assignments on myUnisa. In other words, you may NOT post your assignments to Unisa using the South African Post Office. • All communication between you and the University happens online. Lecturers will communicate with you via e-mail and SMS, and use the Announcements, the Discussion Forums and the Questions and Answers tools. You can also use all of these platforms to ask questions and contact your lecturers. 7.2 myUnisa tools The main tool that we will use is the Lessons tool. This tool will provide the content of and the assessments for your module. At times you will be directed to join discussions with fellow students and complete activities and assessments before you can continue with the module. It is very important that you log in to myUnisa regularly. We recommend that you log in at least once a week to do the following: • Check for new announcements. You can also set your myLife e-mail account so that you receive the announcement e-mails on your cellphone. • Do the Discussion Forum activities. When you do the activities for each learning unit, we want you to share your answers with the other students in your group. You can read the instructions and even prepare your answers offline, but you will need to go online to post your messages. • Do other online activities. For some of the learning unit activities you might need to post something on the Blog tool, take a quiz or complete a survey under the Self-Assessment tool. Do not skip these activities because they will help you complete the assignments and the activities for the module. We hope that by giving you extra ways to study the material and practise all the activities, this will help you succeed in the online module. To get the most out of the online module, you MUST go online regularly to complete the activities and assignments on time. 8.
