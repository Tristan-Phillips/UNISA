User Experience Goals (Subjective) Satisfying, pleasuable, sensual, exiting, entertaining, educational, fun, rewarding VERSUS boring, frustrating, patronizing, gimmicky, childish, annoying Explain the role of software design principles (4) Generalizable abstractions - to aid thinking when designing for user experience - about different aspects of design - e.g feedback, findability Prescriptive - suggest to designers what to provide and what to avoid at the interface - do's and dont's of interaction design Not specifications of how to design, but act as triggers ensuring that they have provided certain features at an interface. List five design principles that are concerned with how to determine what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product according to Preece et al (5) visibility, feedback, constraints, consistency, affordance One of the main design principles for website design is simplicity. Nielsen proposed that designers go through all their design elements and remove them one by one. If a design works well without an element, just remove it. Do you think that this is a good design principle? Discuss (5) Simplicity is certainly an important design principle. Many designers try to cram too much into a screenful of space, making it unwieldy for people to find what they are interested in. Removing design elements to see what can be discarded without affecting the overall function of the website can be a salutary lesson. Unnecessary icons, buttons, boxes, lines, graphics, shading, and text can be stripped, leaving a cleaner, crisper, and easier-to-navigate website. However, graphics, shading, coloring, and formatting can make a site aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable to use. Plain vanilla sites with just lists of text and a few links may not be as appealing and may put certain visitors off returning. Good interaction design involves getting the right balance between aesthetic appeal and the optimal amount and kind of information per page. Explain what are expressive, annoying and persuasive interfaces (9) Using expressive forms, such as emoticons, or icons to convey emotional states or elicit an emotional response towards the system Sometimes computer systems can cause someone to think negative emotions, such as disgust A diversity of technology is being used to draw peoples attention to certain information in order to change what they do and think Discuss how the design of a technology can change the atittude and behaviour of people The design of technology can change a perons attitude and behaviour in various ways, it can cause emotional responses. Take for example being able to click and buy products online with a click of a button, people have less time to think and make an impulsive purchase. Targeted advertising is a lot easier over the internet on technology, etc. There is a fine line between an interaction that works and an interaction that is usable. Designing interactions that work and are usable is achievable if design principles are appropriately applied. Discuss the five design principles that guide interaction design (10) QUESTION 2 What is emotional interaction and what does it entail (5) Using expressive forms, such as emoticons, or icons to convey emotional states or elicit an emotional response towards the system Identify the three levels of Ortony et al (2005) Model of Emotional design and briefly discuss how each level of the model inform the design of a product (9) What is the strength in using brainstorming in interaction design during the requirements gathering stage? (2) List any five recommended rules that need to be followed for a requirements gathering brainstorming session to be a success (10) Young children who cannot read nor write have been observed to have an interest in using or playing with mobile device based applications. Given their interest, it is valuable that interaction designers focus on designing applications that are usable by this group of children. In this respect, as an interaction designer, briefly describe the main interaction types that you would recommend for the design of an interactive game for young children who cannot read or write (9) Briefly explain each of the following terms: usability, framework, conceptual model as they relate to human computer interaction (6) Discuss McCarthy and Wrights four core threads that make up holistic experiences (12) Discuss the core components of a conceptual model (8) A conceptual model is a high level description of how a system is organized and operates. The most important thing to design is the user’s conceptual model. Everything else should be subordinated to making that model clear, obvious, and substantial. That is almost exactly opposite to how most software is designed. A conceptual model is an abstraction that outlines what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. Some things that a conceptual model could comprise of would include… The major metaphors and analogies that are used to convey to the user how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity. The concepts that users are exposed to through the product, including the task domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them. The relationship between those concepts The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke In which three ways can metaphors and analogies be applied in conceptual design? (6) QUESTION 3 You are hired as a usability consultant to evaluate the usability of a library website for a newly established university. The usability evaluation should focus on how effective the website would work when used for research by the university stakeholders on a variety of devices that include smart phones and notebooks. The stakeholders include students, academic staff, support staff and anoyone else with a valid access to the library Briefly describe any three usability goals that would guide your usability testing (6) Effectiveness: ensuring the system is good at what it needs to do Efficiency: ensuring the website supports users carrying out tasks Safety: Ensuring all personal information entered is stored safely Learnability: Ensuring the system is easy to learn If you are to evaluate the website in a usability lab, how many particupants would you invite? Justify your answer (2) 50 participants, split among the categories of stakeholders. Would ensure group is not too large, but not too small Which data capturing methods would you use to collect data from the participants when carrying out the test in a usability laboratory? (3) Observation followed by open ended interview or questionnaire What are the disadvantages of carrying out the evaluation in a laboratory? (4) Its an area with a lot of people in a relatively small space, leading ot possible fear of embarrasment for some users, as well as testing anxiety. What are environmental requirements? (2) Briefly discuss four aspects of environment that should be considered when establishing requirements? (8) Physical environment: Lighting, noise movement Social environment: Collaboration, coordination Organizational environment: Support, facilities, or resources for training Technical environment: Compatible technologies and technological limitations State any five aspects of user characteristics that affect the capturing of software requirements (10) Nationality, educational background, preferences, personal circumstances, physical or mental disabilities, language, and so on, a user may be a novice, an expert, a casual, or frequency user State five advantages of involving users during software development (10) Quality of system will improve since it arises from a more accurate capture of user requirements, since they use the system on a daily basis. Incorporation of costly system features that users cannot or would not want can be avoided. Users can be provided with a system that meets their real expectations instead of what designers and developers think they want. Users won't encounter a surprise when the new system is delivered. By involving users in the process, they will gain a better of understanding of the system which will result in more effective use since they would have seen its capabilities from the early stages of development. Users who were involved in the software development process and feel that they have contributed to a products development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership. Explain what is meant by persuasive technology? (2) The use of technology to draw people's attention to certain kinds of information in an attempt to change what they do or think. Pop-up ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, and recommendations are some of the methods that are being deployed on computer screens. interactive computing systems are deliberately designed to change people's attitudes and behaviors Give any example of persuasion (1) e.g. Amazon's one-click mechanism, splash pages, gorgeous images, in other cases helpful behaviours such as Pokemon + pedometer, water monitoring devices, speed-warning systems, diet apps, etc. Discuss how the design of a technology can change the attitude and behaviour of people (18) A classic early example of a conceptual framework in HCI is Normans explication of the relationships between the design of a conceptual model and the user's understanding of it. The framework comprises three interacting components. the designers model, users model and the system image Discuss each of the above components (6) Why is it important that designers consolidate the three components when designing software? (6) QUESTION 4 What do you understand by the term conceptual model? (2) What are the benefits of conceptualizing the design space? (6) Why are interface metaphors important in interaction design? (2) Interface metaphors combine familiar knowledge with new knowledge in a way that will help the user understand the product. Which are the five key issues that require attention for any data gathering sessions to become successful? (10) Setting goals - identifying participants - relationship with participants - triangulation - investigate phenomenon from at least two different perspectives pilot studies - What should be avoided when designing interview questions? (5) Compound sentences should be split up into separate questions. Avoid jargon or complex language, explain in laymans terms. Keep questions neutral. Several e-readers for reading e-books, watching movies or viewing pictures are available on the market. The exact design differs between models but they support book reading that is intended to be as comfortable as reading a paper book. The developers of the new e-reader want to find out how appealing it will be to young people under 18 years of age. To this end, they have asked you to conduct some interviews for them. You are required to answer the following questions in preparation for the interview What is the goal of your data gathering sessions? (2) The main reason for gathering data at all is to glean information about something. For example, you might want to understand how technology fits into normal family life, or you might want to identify which of two icons representing ‘send message’ is easier to use, or you might want to find out whether the redesign you are planning for a hand-held meter reader is along the right lines. The goals that are set will influence the nature of the data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and also the analysis to be performed. The goals may be expressed more or less formally, e.g. using some structured or even mathematical format, or using a simple description such as the ones in the previous paragraph, but whatever the format they should be clear and concise. List any three techniques that could be used for capturing the interview (3) audio + notes, pictures + notes, video What are the disadvantages of taking notes during interviews? (2) It's slow, tedious, and information is likely to be missed. It completely misses important non-verbal queues and information, such as gestures, fidgeting, pauses, etc. Suggest any three unstructured interview questions that focus on user experience goals (3) Can you tell me a bit more about . . . What are the advantages of using a touch screen?’ How do you feel about ..x.. feature? QUESTION 5 When following a user-centered approach in interaction design, there is a principle of focus on users and tasks early. This is one of the principles that make it easy and useful to use a computer system Name and explain five sub-principles that explain the meaning of the above statement (10) 1. Users’ tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development. In a user-centered approach to design, while technology will inform design options and choices, it should not be the driving force. Instead of saying ‘Where can we deploy this new technology?’ say ‘What technologies are available to provide better support for users’ goals?' 2. Users’ behavior and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them. This is about more than just capturing the tasks and the users’ goals. How people perform their tasks is also significant. Understanding behavior highlights priorities, preferences, and implicit intentions. One argument against studying current behavior is that we are looking to improve work, not to capture bad habits in automation. The implication is that exposing designers to users is likely to stifle innovation and creativity, but experience tells us that the opposite is true (Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1998). In addition, if something is designed to support an activity with little understanding of the real work involved, it is likely to be incompatible with current practice, and users don't like to deviate from their learned habits if operating a new device with similar properties. 3. Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for. When things go wrong with technology, we often say that it is our fault. But as humans, we are prone to making errors and we have certain limitations, both cognitive and physical. Products designed to support humans should take these limitations into account and should limit the mistakes we make. Cognitive aspects such as attention, memory, and perception issues were introduced in Chapter 3. Physical aspects include height, mobility, and strength. Some characteristics are general, such as about one man in 12 has some form of color blindness, but some characteristics may be associated more with the job or particular task at hand. So, as well as general characteristics, we need to capture those specific to the intended user group. 4. Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to the latest and their input is seriously taken into account. As discussed above, there are different levels of user involvement and there are different ways in which to consult users. However involvement is organized, it is important that users are respected by designers. 5. All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment. This does not necessarily mean that users are actively involved in design decisions. As long as designers remain aware of the users while making their decisions, then this principle will be upheld. Keeping this context in mind can be difficult, but using personas is one way to achieve this (see Chapter 10); an easily accessible collection of gathered data is another. Some design teams set up a specific design room for the project where data and informal records of brainstorming sessions are pinned on the walls or left on the table. How would you apply the five sub principles in improving the myUnisa system? (10) [Learn above principles, make something up] QUESTION 6 Cognitive walkthroughs involve simulating a uer's problem-solving process at each step in the human computer dialog, checking to see if the user's goals and memory for actions can be assumed to lead to the next correct action. Discuss each of the five steps involved in cognitive walkthroughs (10) Heuristic evaluation is an informal usability inspection technique developed by Nielsen and his colleagues in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menu navigation structure or on-line help conform to the principles. Discuss heuristic evaluation under the following headings Briefly discuss the three stages of doing heuristic evaluation (6) 1. The briefing session, in which the experts are told what to do. A prepared script is useful as a guide and to ensure each person receives the same briefing. 2. The evaluation period, in which each expert typically spends 1–2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. The experts need to take at least two passes through the interface. The first pass gives a feel for the flow of the interaction and the product's scope. The second pass allows the evaluator to focus on specific interface elements in the context of the whole product, and to identify potential usability problems. If the evaluation is for a functioning product, the evaluators need to have some specific user tasks in mind so that exploration is focused. Suggesting tasks may be helpful but many experts suggest their own tasks. However, this approach is less easy if the evaluation is done early in design when there are only screen mockups or a specification; the approach needs to be adapted to the evaluation circumstances. While working through the interface, specification, or mockups, a second person may record the problems identified, or the evaluator may think aloud. Alternatively, she may take notes herself. Evaluators should be encouraged to be as specific as possible and to record each problem clearly. 3. The debriefing session, in which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings and to prioritize the problems they found and suggest solutions. Shcneiderman's eight golden rules are used as heuristics for identifying usability problems. Discuss the following three rules: Strive for consistency. Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations: identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens; and consistent color, layout, capitalization, fonts, and so on should be employed throughout. Exceptions, such as required confirmation of the delete command or no echoing of passwords, should be comprehensible and limited in number. Cater for universal usability (3) Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Novice to expert differences, age ranges, disabilities, and technological diversity each enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices, such as explanations, and features for experts, such as shortcuts and faster pacing, can enrich the interface design and improve perceived system quality. Offer informative feedback (3) For every user action, there should be system feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can be modest, whereas for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial. Visual presentation of the objects of interest provides a convenient environment for showing changes explicitly. Permit easy reversal of actions (3) Ashould be reversible. Relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data-entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name-address block. Support internal locus of control (3) Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions. They don't want surprises or changes in familiar behavior, and they are annoyed by tedious dataentry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary information, and inability to produce their desired result. Design dialogs to yield closure. Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to prepare for the next group of actions. For example, ecommerce websites move users from selecting products to the checkout, ending with a clear confirmation page that completes the transaction. Reduce short-term memory load. Humans’ limited capacity for information processing in short-term memory (the rule of thumb is that we can remember ‘seven plus or minus two chunks’ of information) requires that designers avoid interfaces in which users must remember information from one screen and then use that information on another screen. It means that smartphones should not require re-entry of phone numbers, website locations should remain visible, multiple-page displays should be consolidated, and sufficient training time should be allotted for complex sequences of actions. Prevent errors. As much as possible, design the system such that users cannot make serious errors; for example, gray out menu items that are not appropriate and do not allow alphabetic characters in numeric entry fields. If a user makes an error, the interface hould detect the error and offer simple, constructive, and specific instructions for recovery. For example, users should not have to retype an entire name-address form if they enter an invalid zip code, but rather should be guided to repair only the faulty part. rroneous actions should leave the system state unchanged, or the interface should give instructions about restoring the state.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
