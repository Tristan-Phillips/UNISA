In response to this charter, we have also placed curriculum transformation high on the agenda. For your information, curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both the programme and module levels, as a phased-in approach. You will notice the implementation thereof in your modules, and we encourage you to fully embrace these changes during your studies at Unisa. 1 INTRODUCTION Dear Student Greetings to you and welcome to the Computer Graphics module. We hope that you find it interesting and exciting. COS3712 is a final year undergraduate (i.e. third year) semester module. We are obliged to offer a course that is comparable in standard to what other universities in the world offer in CG (Computer Graphics) at this level. As the School of Computing, we opted for a CG programming course using WebGL, which is based on OpenGL a state-of-the-art and widely used public domain graphics API, (application programming interface). COS3712 is not primarily a programming module. The theory of CG, including its mathematical foundations (linear algebra), is the primary focus. A certain amount of practical programming is included in COS3712 to illustrate how the theory is applied. The prescribed book that we use covers some of the linear algebra applicable to CG in Chapter 4, as well as in two appendices at the end of the textbook. Additional notes on linear algebra are also available as an additional resource on myunisa. 2 PURPOSE AND OUTCOMES 2.1 Purpose Students who successfully complete this module will be equipped with knowledge of the fundamental principles and techniques of modern Computer Graphics. They will be able to use these ideas, methods and tools to write and implement graphics applications of medium complexity. This module presents a top-down, programming-oriented approach to computer graphics with an emphasis on applications programming. Areas covered include Application Programming Interfaces (API’s), three dimensional graphics, interactive graphics, as well all aspects of the computer graphics pipeline 2.2 Outcomes For this module, there are several outcomes that we hope you will be able to accomplish by the end of the course: Specific outcome 1: Demonstrate an understanding of graphics systems, models, architectures and API’s. 4 Specific outcome 2: Demonstrate an understanding of the basic principles involved in programming two-dimensional graphics applications. Specific outcome 3: Demonstrate an understanding of how to develop user input and interaction in computer graphics applications. Specific outcome 4: Demonstrate an understanding of how geometric objects and transformations can be used in 3-Dimensional Computer graphics. Specific outcome 5: Demonstrate an understanding of 3-dimensional programming techniques and concepts, including viewing, lighting, shading and discrete techniques. Specific outcome 6: Demonstrate an understanding of the four major tasks of the graphics pipeline including modeling, geometry processing, rasterization and fragment processing. 3 LECTURER(S) AND CONTACT DETAILS 3.1 Lecturer(s) Please see the COSALL tutorial letters for the telephone numbers of the lecturers on this module.

Communication with fellow Students Studying through distance education can make you feel as if you are alone out there, with no support or anyone with whom to share your frustrations and/or achievements. But this need not be the case. On the myUnisa site we will be forming a “classroom” where you can discuss any topics you’d like to. You need not feel alone while doing this module; actively participate in all the discussions and feel like a real student in a real study environment. The online Discussion Forum might not give you the physical contact of attending a class, but it will  provide contact between learners and faculty  provide cooperation between learners  encourage active learning  provide prompt feedback  communicate expectations  present diverse talents and ways of learning Should you feel the need to form a study group in your particular area, you can add your name, contact details and the area in which you want to start the group to the forum topic related to study groups on the Discussion Forum to the left of this screen. Don’t just sit back and expect other students to contact you to form the group; be an active participant and be willing to take the first step by contacting them. Support provided by the Lecturer The myUnisa website will serve as your class room. You must reflect on your studies using the Blog, ask relevant questions using the Discussion Forum, test your knowledge with the Self Assessments, study by referring to the Learning Units. E-Tutors Please be informed that, Unisa offers online tutorials (e-tutoring) to students registered for modules at NQF level 5,6 and 7, this means qualifying undergraduate modules. Students registered for this module will be allocated to a group of students with whom you will be interacting during the tuition period as well as an e-tutor who will be your tutorial facilitator. COS3712/101/3/2020 7 Once you have been allocated to a group you will receive an sms informing you about your group, the name of your e-tutor and instructions on how to log onto MyUnisa in order to receive further information on the e-tutoring process. Online tutorials are conducted by qualified E-Tutors who are appointed by Unisa and are offered free of charge. All you need to be able to participate in e-tutoring is a computer with internet connection. If you live close to a Unisa regional Centre or a Telecentre contracted with Unisa, please feel free to visit any of these to access the internet. E-tutoring takes place on MyUnisa where you are expected to connect with other students in your allocated group. It is the role of the e-tutor to guide you through your study material during this interaction process. For you to get the most out of online tutoring, you need to participate in the online discussions that the e- tutor will be facilitating. There are modules which students have been found to repeatedly fail, these modules are allocated face-to-face tutors and tutorials for these modules take place at the Unisa regional centres. These tutorials are also offered free of charge, however, it is important for you to register at your nearest Unisa Regional Centre to secure attendance of these classes. Free computer and internet access Unisa has entered into partnerships with establishments (referred to as Telecentres) in various locations across South Africa to enable you (as a Unisa student) free access to computers and the Internet. This access enables you to conduct the following academic related activities: registration; online submission of assignments; engaging in e-tutoring activities and signature courses; etc. Please note that any other activities outside of these are for your own costing e.g. printing, photocopying, etc. For more information on the Telecentre nearest to you, please visit www.unisa.ac.za/telecentres. 6 STUDY PLAN The table below reflects a possible study plan you could use during the semester.

You need to submit code for this assignment. Place all your files that would be required to execute your project in a zip folder and upload on myunisa. In this project you have to design and construct a truck. The truck should be made up of the following :  Head of truck – Rectangular block  Trailer – Rectangular block  4 wheels – narrow cylinders The 4 wheels must be the same colour and the head and trailer different colours. The truck must be on a road. The truck must be able to move on the road from one end of the viewing window to the other. The wheels of the truck do not have to be spinning. Add buttons to your project to do the following:  Toggle movement. Start and stop animation of truck.  Toggle(change) direction of animation. 10 Add sliders to your project to do the following  Increase and decrease the speed of the truck.  Zoom in/out to the centre of your viewing window. Assignment 2 – Semester 1 students NB. You need to submit code for this assignment. Place all your files that would be required to execute your project in a zip folder and upload on myunisa. You are required to make the truck created in the previous project (assignment 1) more realistic by adding lighting, material properties and texture mapping. You are required to create two different scenes. The first is a day scene in which you define a directional light whose colour is white in all its components and that has constant attenuation. The second is a night scene for which you have to add reflectors on the road and lights to the front of the truck. Make your truck looking as realistic as possible by adding a minimum of two texture maps to the truck. Assignment 1 – Semester 2 students NB. You need to submit code for this assignment. Place all your files that would be required to execute your project in a zip folder and upload on myunisa. In this project you have to design and construct a simple farm. The farm should contain the following three types of structures with one structure of each type:  A water tank - Use a cylinder.  A House - A rectangular structure with prism roof  Trees – Use cylinders for the trunk and cones to depict the top half of the tree.  An Igloo – Semi-sphere For the barn, the roof and supporting structure (walls) should be of different colours. You also need to define the ground on which the structures are situated. Add buttons to your project to do the following:  Toggle rotation. Start and stop (toggle) rotation of scene.  Toggle(change) direction of rotation. Add sliders to your project to do the following  Increase and decrease the speed of rotation of shape.  Zoom in/out to the centre of your room. COS3712/101/3/2020 11 Pressing the secondary (right) button should activate the pop-up menu described below. The pop-up menu should contain the following functionality:  Zoom in and zoom out  Toggle(change) direction of rotation  Terminate the program Assignment 2 – Semester 2 students You are required to make the farm created in the previous project (assignment 1) more realistic by adding lighting and material properties. You are required to create two different scenes. The first is a day scene in which you define the sun as a directional light whose colour is white in all its components and that has constant attenuation. The second is a night scene for which you have to add three garden lights in open spaces. Define each “garden” light as a positional light. The night scene should also include a moon and some stars. Do not use lights for any of these. Manipulate the emissivity of the respective materials to obtain the desired lighting effect. Your program should retain all the functionality of the previous project. Add buttons that will allow the user to switch between scenes. You are required to apply two texture maps to any part of your scene to make it look more realistic. 8.7 Other assessment methods No other assessment methods on this module. 8.8 The examination Your exam is written in May/June for semester 1 students and October/November for semester two students. UNISA will inform you of the exam date. The examinations will primarily be based on the theory covered in your textbook. Past exam papers are available on myunisa. 9 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Can I use previous editions of the textbook? No, you have to use the latest edition which is based on WebGL. Where do I find the software for this module? WebGL is web based and so all you need to do your assignments is a text editor like notepad and an internet browser. You will have to learn some javascript, which is not difficult if you know C++ or JAVA. 10 SOURCES CONSULTED Angel, Edward. Shreiner, Dave(2015).
