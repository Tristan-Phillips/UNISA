(2 marks) A. Error messages should be precise rather than vague. B. Error messages should avoid context-sensitive help. C. Error messages should avoid friendly cute images. D. Error messages should provide precise error code numbers. 1.7 The developers of a new e-reader want to find out how appealing such a device would be to undergraduate students at Unisa.

INF3720 OCT/NOV Please turn over 1.8 The why-aspect of evaluation during interaction design is correctly described as: (2 marks) A. All types of systems, their workflow, aesthetic design, and safety features should be evaluated. B. Problems should be identified and fixed before a product goes on sale to improve sales because well- designed products sell better. C. Evaluation of a new product or upgrade should be done during design, after implementation and during its use. D. Design choices can be tested in a lab while user experience aspects can be evaluated in natural settings. 1.9 Assume that you were hired by Facebook to evaluate the design concepts underlying the app. To gather information, you have decided to interview five adults, five teenagers and five senior citizens because:(2 marks) A.

Nielsen’s heuristics target the accessibility of websites for users with disabilities while Budd’s heuristics focus on consistent design. C. Nielsen’s heuristics focus exclusively on UX goals while Budd’s heuristics focus exclusively on usability goals. D. Budd’s heuristics place more emphasis on information content and user experience aspects while Nielsen’s heuristics primarily focus on usability issues.
