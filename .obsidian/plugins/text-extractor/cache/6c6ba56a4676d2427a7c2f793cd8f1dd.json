• How to change human behavior through the use of emotive feedback www.id-book.com Activity • Try to remember the emotions you went through when buying a big ticket item online (e.g. a fridge, a vacation, a computer) • How many different emotions did you go through? www.id-book.com Why has this simple way of obtaining visitor feedback been so effective? www.id-book.com Pulling at the heart strings with emotive message www.id-book.com How easy is it to design an interface to match or change how we are feeling? • Should an interface be designed to improve how we feel? – If so how? • Our moods and feelings are continuously changing – How does the interface keep track and know when to do something? • What moods match which kinds of interfaces? • How would you design an interface for when someone is happy, angry, sad, bored, focussed? www.id-book.com How do emotions affect behavior and behavior emotions? • Examine how people express themselves and read each other (emotional intelligence) – understand relationship between facial expressions, body language, gestures and tone of voice, e.g. – when people are happy they laugh and relax body posture – when they are angry they screw up their face • Does being angry make you concentrate better or more distracted? • When you are happy do you take more risks such as spend more money or buy more? • Baumeister et al (2007) argue the relationship is more complex than a single cause-and-effect model www.id-book.com Automatic (affect) versus conscious emotions • Emotions can be short-lived (e.g. fit of anger) or complex and long-lasting (e.g. jealousy) • Have been categorized as automatic or conscious – Automatic ones are rapid and dissipate quickly – Conscious ones develop slowly and take a long time to go (e.g. reflection) www.id-book.com Ortony et al (2005) model of emotional design www.id-book.com Claims from model • Our emotional state changes how we think – when frightened or angry we focus narrowly and body responds by tensing muscles and sweating • more likely to be less tolerant – when happy we are less focused and the body relaxes – More likely to overlook minor problems and be more creative www.id-book.com Designing with the three levels in mind • Visceral design refers o making products look, feel and sound good • Behavioral design is about use and equates with traditional values of usability • Reflective design is about considering the meaning and personal value of a product www.id-book.com Analyzing a swatch watch design using the model • Cultural images and graphical elements designed at reflective level • Affordances of use at behavioral level • Brilliant colors and wild design attract user’s attention at visceral level www.id-book.com Expressive interfaces • Provide reassuring feedback that can be both informative and fun • But can also be intrusive, causing people to get annoyed and even angry • Color, icons, sounds, graphical elements and animations are used to make the ‘look and feel’ of an interface appealing – conveys an emotional state • In turn this can affect the usability of an interface – people are prepared to put up with certain aspects of an interface (e.g. slow download rate) if the end result is appealing and aesthetic www.id-book.com The appearance of an interface • (a) Emotional icons were used in the 80s to indicate rebooting or crashed – smiling apple face • (b) Nowadays use more impersonal but aesthetically pleasing icons to indicate user needs to wait – the beachball www.id-book.com The design of thermostats • (a) The Nest has a minimalist and aesthetically pleasing design – Round face and simple dial – Large font and numbers • (b) Very different from earlier thermostat designs – utilitarian and dull www.id-book.com Annoying interfaces • Microsoft pioneered friendly interfaces for technophobes – e.g. ‘At home with Bob’ software – 3D metaphors based on familiar places (e.g. living rooms) • Agents in the guise of pets (e.g. bunny, dog) were included to talk to the user – Make users feel more at ease and comfortable – But many people did not like the idea of Bob so never made it to product www.id-book.com At home with Bob www.id-book.com Microsoft’s Clippy and IKEA’s Anna • Clippy did… • But was disliked by so many? – Was it annoying, distracting, patronising or other? • Anna appeared as a virtual agent – Blinked, moved her lips and head to suggest facial expressions www.id-book.com Frustrating interfaces • Many causes: – When an application doesn’t work properly or crashes – When a system doesn’t do what the user wants it to do – When a user’s expectations are not met – When a system does not provide sufficient information to enable the user to know what to do – When error messages pop up that are vague, obtuse or condemning – When the appearance of an interface is garish, noisy, gimmicky or patronizing – When a system requires users to carry out too many steps to perform a task, only to discover a mistake was made earlier and they need to start all over again www.id-book.com Error messages “The application Word Wonder has unexpectedly quit due to a type 2 error.” Why not instead: “the application has expectedly quit due to poor coding in the operating system” • Shneiderman’s classic guidelines for error messages include: • avoid using terms like FATAL, INVALID, BAD • Audio warnings • Avoid UPPERCASE and long code numbers • Messages should be precise rather than vague • Provide context-sensitive help www.id-book.com A friendly cute image instead of the impersonal 404 error message www.id-book.com Dilemma: Should computers say they’re sorry? • Reeves and Naas (1996) argue that computers should be made to apologize • Should emulate human etiquette • Would users be as forgiving of computers saying sorry as people are of each other when saying sorry? • How sincere would they think the computer was being? For example, after a system crash: – “I’m really sorry I crashed. I’ll try not to do it again” • How else should computers communicate with users? www.id-book.com Dilemma: Should Voice assistants teach kids good manners? • Many children talk to Alexa as if she was their friend • They also learn that it is not necessary to say please and thank you to her when asking questions • Is this lack of using etiquette a problem? • Would it transfer over to real life situations? – e.g. demanding “Aunty, get me my drink.” • Parents should still teach their kids good manners • Alexa can be configured to be polite as well • How much parental control should voice assistants be given? • Would children find it weird or creepy that their Alexa (who is their friend) nags them to clean their teeth? www.id-book.com Affective Computing and Emotional AI • Affective computing concerned with how to use computers to recognize and express emotions as humans do (Picard, 1998) • Involves designing ways for people to communicate their emotional state • Uses sensing technologies to measure GSR, facial expressions, gestures, body movement • Explores how affect influences personal health • Emotional AI aims to automate the measurement of feelings and behavior using AI to infer them from facial expressions and voice • Aim is to predict user’s emotions and aspects of their behavior – e.g. what is someone most likely to buy online when feeling sad, bored or happy www.id-book.com Techniques used • Cameras for measuring facial expressions • . • Biosensors placed on fingers or palms to measure GSR • Affective expression in speech (e.g. intonation, pitch, loudness) • Body movement and gestures using accelerometers and motion capture systems www.id-book.com Classification of emotions • Six core expressions typically measured: – sadness, disgust, fear, anger, contempt, joy • Type of facial expression chosen by AI through detecting presence of absence of: – Smiling, eye widening, brow raising, brow furrowing, raising a cheek, mouth opening, upper-lip raising, wrinkling of the nose www.id-book.com Facial coding using Affdex software www.id-book.com How is this emotional data used? • If user screws up their face when an ad pops up -> feel disgust • If start smiling -> they are feeling happy • Website can adapt its ad, movie storyline or content to match user’s emotional state • If system used in a car it might detect an angry driver and suggest driver takes a deep breath • Eye-tracking, finger pulse, speech and words/phrases also analysed when tweeting or posting to Facebook www.id-book.com Indirect emotion detection • Also used more to infer or predict someone’s behavior – e.g. determining a person’s suitability for a job or how they will vote at an election • Do you think it is ethical that technology can read your emotions from your facial expressions or from your tweets? www.id-book.com Persuasive technologies and behavioral change • Interacive computing systems designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviors (Fogg, 2003) • A diversity of techniques now used to change what they do or think – Pop-up ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, recommendations, Amazon 1-click – Commonly referred to as nudging www.id-book.com 32 Nintendo’s Pocket Pikachu • Was developed to change bad habits and improve well being – Designed to motivate children to be more physically active on a regular basis – owner of the digital pet that ‘lives’in the device is required to walk, run, or jump – If owner does not exercise the virtual pet becomes angry and refuses to play anymore www.id-book.com How effective? • Can interactive technologies that monitor, nag, or behave like a human keep them interested in looking after it and in doing so fitter, themselves? • How does looking after a virtual pet change a child’s behavior? – Emotional attachment – Happy Pokemon makes them feel good – Sulking Pokemon makes them feel bad www.id-book.com Tracking devices • Mobile apps designed to help people monitor and change their behaviour (e.g. fitness, sleeping, weight) • Can compare with online leader boards and charts, to show how they have done in relation to their peers and friends • Also apps that encourage reflection that in turn increase well-being and happiness www.id-book.com Sustainable HCI • Focus on designing tech interventions to help people reduce their energy consumption • An effective technique is to provide householders with feedback on their consumption • Simple infographics and emoticons are often most powerful – Encourage people to reflect and see what they can change to reduce their energy consumption • Peer pressure and social norms are also powerful methods www.id-book.com The Tidy Street project • :arge-scale visualization of the street’s electricity usage – stenciled display on the road surface using chalk – provided realtime feedback that all could see change each day – reduced electricity consumption by 15% www.id-book.com Bird and Rogers, 2010) Phishing scams • Web used to deceive people into parting with personal details – e.g. Paypal, eBay, and won the lottery letters • Allows Internet fraudsters to access their bank accounts and draw money from them • Many vulnerable people fall for it • The art of deception is centuries old but internet allows ever more ingenious ways to trick people www.id-book.com Anthropomorphism • Attributing human-like qualities to inanimate objects (e.g. cars, computers) • Well known phenomenon in advertising – dancing butter, drinks, breakfast cereals • Much exploited in human-computer interaction – make user experience enjoyable, motivating, make people feel at ease, reduce anxiety • Furnishing technologies with personalities can make them enjoyable to interact with www.id-book.com Which message you prefer? As a welcome message: • “Hello Chris! Nice to see you again. Welcome back. Now what were we doing last time? Oh yes, exercise 5. Let’s start again.” • “User 24, commence exercise 5.” www.id-book.com Which do you prefer? • Feedback when user gets something wrong: 1. “Now Chris, that’s not right. You can do better than that. Try again.” 2. “Incorrect. Try again.” • Is there a difference as to what you prefer depending on type of message? Why? www.id-book.com Evidence to support anthropomorphism • Reeves and Naas (1996) found that computers that flatter and praise users in education software programs -> positive impact on them “Your question makes an important and useful distinction. Great job!” • Students were more willing to continue with exercises with this kind of feedback www.id-book.com 42 Robot-like or cuddly? Which do you prefer and why? www.id-book.com Aibo The Haptic Creature Is it OK for senior people to develop an emotional attachment with the robot Zora? www.id-book.com Summary • Emotional aspects of interaction design are concerned with how to facilitate certain states (e.g. pleasure) or avoid reactions (e.g. frustration) • Well-designed interfaces can elicit good feelings in people • Aesthetically pleasing interfaces can be a pleasure to use • Expressive interfaces can provide reassuring feedback to users • Badly designed interfaces make people frustrated, annoyed, or angry • Emotional AI and affective computing use AI and sensor technology for detecting people’s emotions through analyzing their facial expressions and conversations • Emotional technologies can be designed to persuade people to change their behaviors • Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human qualities to objects • Increasingly robots are being used as companions in the home www.id-book.com","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
