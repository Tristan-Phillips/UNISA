Device controllers → provide for an interface between the peripheral’ s that it controls and the operating system. It collaborates with the device driver , by a means of interrupt, special-purpose registers and when necessary , Direct Memory Access (DMA), to transfer data from/to the peripherals to/from the buf fer storage Device driver → Understands the device controller and hence provides the rest of the operating system with a uniform interface to the device Q u e s tio n 2 What are the five major activities of an operating system with regard to file management ? 1 . The creation and deletion of files 2 . The creation and deletion of directories 3 . The support of primitives for manipulating files and directories 4 . The mapping of files onto secondary storage 5 . The backup of files on stable (non-volatile) storage media Q u e s tio n 3 Interrupts : a) What is the purpose of interrupts ? An interrupt is a hardware-generated change of flow within the system. Assignment 12 An Interrupt is the mechanism by which modules like I/O or memory may interrupt the normal processing by CPU b) How does an interrupt differ from a trap ? A trap is a software-generated interrupt. An interrupt can be used to signal the completion of an I/O to obviate the need for device polling. A trap can be used to call operating system routines or to catch arithmetic errors. c) Can traps be generated intentionally by a user program ? Yes, traps can be generated intentionally by a user program d) If so, for what purpose? if not, why not? The purpose of generating a trap intentionally by a user program is to call operating system routines or to catch arithmetic errors Q u e s tio n 4 Direct memory access is used for high-speed I/O devices in order to avoid increasing the CPU’ s execution load a) How does the CPU interface with the device to coordinate the transfer ? The CPU can initiate a DMA operation by writing values into special registers that can be independently accessed by the device. The device initiates the corresponding operation once it receives a command from the CPU b) How does the CPU know when the memory operations are complete ? When the device is finished with its operation, it interrupts the CPU to indicate the completion of the operation. Both the device and the CPU can be accessing memory simultaneously . The memory controller provides access to the memory bus in a fair manner to these two entities c) The CPU is allowed to execute other programs while the DMA controller is transferring data. Does this process interfere with the execution of the user programs? If so, describe what forms of interference are caused Yes, A CPU might therefore be unable to issue memory operations at peak speeds since it has to complete with the device in order to obtain access to the memory busAssignment 13 Q u e s tio n 5 Microkernel a) What is the main advantage of the microkernel approach to system design? The main advantage’ s are : 1 . Adding a new service does not require modifying the kernel 2 . It is more secure as more operations are done in user mode than in kernel mode 3 . A simpler kernel design and functionality typically results in a more reliable operating system b) How do user programs and system services interact in a microkernel architecture ? Using inter-process communication mechanisms such as messaging. These messages are conveyed by the operating system c) What are the disadvantages of using the microkernel approach ? The primary disadvantages of the microkernel architecture is the overheads associated with inter-process communication and the frequent use of the operating system’ s messaging functions in order to enable the user process and the system service to interact with each-other Q u e s tio n 6 Distinguish between the client-server and peer-to-peer models of Distributed systems The client-server model firmly distinguishes the roles of the client and server . Under this model, the client requests services that are provided by the server . The peer-to-peer model doesn't have such strict roles. All nodes in the system are considered peers and thus may act as either clients or servers or both. A node may request a service from another peer , or the node may provide such a service to other peers in the system Q u e s tio n 7Assignment 14 In a multiprogramming and time-sharing environment, several users share the system simultaneously . This situation can result in various security problems a) What are two such problems ? Stealing or copying one’ s programs or data Using system resources without proper accounting b) Can we ensure the same degree of security in a time-shared machine as in a dedicated machine? Explain your answer No, any human-designed protective strategy will inevitably be broken by a human, and the more complicated the plan, the more dif ficult it is to be sure in its proper implementation. Q u e s tio n 8 Why do some systems store the operating system in firmware, while others store it on disk ? A large number of mobile devices and embedded systems generally have permanent storage with limited capacity , low speed CPU, an operating system with limited features and have little concern about updating frequently their system. Thus, the need for such devices to have their operating system (and/or programs pre-installed or) stored in firmware","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
