[TURN PAGE] 3 COS3751 October/November 2021 Question 1 Intelligent Agents [20] Tile Matching This question involves a problem-solving agent. The environment for this problem is a 5 × 5 tiled area. Each tile has one letter from a set of three different letters painted on it (as shown in Figure 1). The agent starts in position (0, 0) (the bottom left corner) and must ﬁnd any two tiles that display the same letter. In Figure 1, {(0, 0), (1, 1)} would be a valid solution. A C A B B B A C C A C C B B C B C A C C B B B A C Figure 1: The tiled and labelled square (a) What kind of agent would be needed to solve this problem? Explain your answer. (3) (b) Deﬁne a mathematical representation for the problem. This representation should be sufﬁcient to store all of the information required to solve the problem. (6) (c) Show the initial state using the representation given in b above? (4) (d) Determine an appropriate cost function for solving this problem. Justify your answer. (3) (e) Deﬁne the appropriate actions for this problem. Then using the successor function Result(a, S) 7→ S′, show how applying each action a to some state S results in some state S′. Note: for the purposes of this question you do not need to describe how the actions could be executed. (4) [TURN PAGE] 4 COS3751 October/November 2021 Question 2 Searching [13] (a) Consider the tree show below. Show how Breadth ﬁrst search would search the tree to ﬁnd the node labeled G. Be sure to show which node is being explored, which nodes have already been ex- plored and which nodes are in the frontier. (5) A B D E C F I M N G K J [TURN PAGE] 5 COS3751 October/November 2021 (b) Consider the following graph: S(12) e(7) c(10) d(7)j(13) h(9) i(8) l(2) k(7) m(2) G 2 3 3 5 6 7 2 2 4 2 4 2 3 3 3 Each node shows the ˆh value (estimate to the goal) in parentheses after the node name. Each edge shows the ˆg value next to it. Assume that an A ∗ search is employed, that the start node is S, and the goal is G. The ﬁrst 2 steps (start node added to frontier, the expansion of that node, and the state of the frontier) are shown in the table below. The node expanded column shows the ˆg, ˆh, and ˆf values in parentheses after the node name, and the frontier shows the ˆf value in parentheses after the front-most node in the path has been explored): Step Node expanded Frontier 1 [< S(12) >] 2 S(0, 12, 12) [< e(9), S >, < d(10), S >, < c(12), S >] 3 4 5 6 . . . . . . Complete the table by showing the list of nodes in the order in which they are expanded (not just explored) and the state of the open queue when the nodes are expanded. (8) [TURN PAGE] 6 COS3751 October/November 2021 Question 3 Adversarial Search [18] Consider the game tree below and then answer the questions that follow. Note: the static utility values for the leaf nodes are provided below each leaf node. A B D G H E I J C F K M L N 3 6 9 4 7 5 (a) Suppose a Minimax search is performed on the tree. Provide the min-max values for nodes A, B, C, D, E and F . (3) (b) Suppose a Minimax search with Alpha/Beta pruning is done in a left-to-right fashion on the tree. Show how the search proceeds from the start (root) node. Your answer must proceed in a step-by-step fashion showing the v/α/β values for each node as the search pro- gresses (i.e. the v/α/β values as they propagate down the tree to child nodes), as well as which values are returned to the parent nodes. Also clearly indicate the tests for α/β cuts. Please note that you are only expected to trace the search on the left subtree of the given tree. (10) The ﬁrst four lines of the solution are given to assist you in aswering the question: 1. A: max – v = −∞, α = −∞, β = ∞ expand B 2. B: min – v = ∞, α = −∞, β = ∞, expand D 3. D: max – v = −∞, α = −∞, β = ∞ expand G [TURN PAGE] 7 COS3751 October/November 2021 4. G: min – return utility value, ie return 3 (c) If the trace was continued on the right subtree of the given tree would the value of v at node A change? Explain your answer. (5) [TURN PAGE] 8 COS3751 October/November 2021 Question 4 Constraint Satisfaction Problems [14] A group of people need to travel a longish distance together during Covid-19 times. Social distancing and common sense mean that they have to have a good plan of who can travel in a shared car and thus how many cars are needed. Each car can carry at most 4 people. They decide that – People who live together can travel together. People who have been fully vaccinated, or who have had Covid-19, can travel three in a car. Any unvaccinated person can travel with at most one other person (vaccinated, unvacci- nated or had Covid-19) in a car. (a) Deﬁne the variables for this Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and explain why this deﬁnition makes sense. (2) (b) Deﬁne the domain for each variable in the CSP. (2) (c) Describe how one could go about solving any instance of this CSP. Then demonstrate your approach on the instance of the problem given below.

John, M ary constants denoting people dog, cat, hamster constants denoting types of pets pet(p1, x1) predicate: animal p1 is a pet of person x1 f riend(f1, f2) predicate: person f1 is a friend of person f2 drinks(p) predicate: person p drinks wine single(q) predicate: person q is single job(r) predicate: person r has a job happy(k) predicate: person k is happy Consider the following English statements. • John is single and has a job. • John has a dog as a pet • John and Mary are friends • All people who drink wine and have jobs are happy. • Single people drink wine. • People who have a pet are happy. (a) Using the vocabulary speciﬁed above, express the English statements above in First- order Logic (FOL). (8) (b) Convert the FOL statements for the ﬁrst three bulletpoints above to clausal form (CNF). Then use these CNF statements and resolution refutation to prove that John drinks wine. (10) [TURN PAGE] 10 COS3751 October/November 2021 Question 6 Machine Learning [17] Consider the following table which provides examples of weather conditions used to deter- mine whether a family will have a picnic on the beach on a given day. Nr Outlook Temperature Windy Crowded Picnic? 1 Sunny Hot Yes No No 2 Sunny Hot No No Yes 3 Sunny Hot No Yes Yes 4 Sunny Mild Yes No Yes 5 Sunny Mild No Yes No 6 Sunny Mild Yes Yes No 7 Sunny Cool Yes No No 8 Overcast Hot Yes No No 9 Overcast Hot No No Yes 10 Overcast Cool No Yes Yes 11 Overcast Mild Yes Yes No 12 Overcast Hot No No Yes 13 Rain Mild Yes No No 14 Rain Mild No No Yes 15 Rain Cool No Yes No 16 Rain Cool Yes No No (a) Determine the root node of the decision tree for this table. Show all your calculations during the determination of the root node (all the entropy, remainder and information gain calculations). Use the table on page 11 for your entropy values and calculations. (14) (b) Suppose the data in the table were such that two attributes returned exactly the same information gain. Would there be a good basis for choosing one over the other as the root of the decision tree? (3) Total: 100 [TURN PAGE] 11 COS3751 October/November 2021 A Entropy Table (Boolean valued variables) p : Ratio of positive examples. E : Corresponding entropy (−(plog2p + (1 − p)log2(1 − p))). p E 0.00 0.00 0.10 0.47 0.15 0.61 0.20 0.72 0.25 0.81 0.30 0.88 0.35 0.93 0.40 0.97 0.45 0.99 0.50 1.00 0.55 0.99 0.60 0.97 0.65 0.93 0.70 0.88 0.75 0.81 0.80 0.72 0.85 0.61 0.90 0.47 0.95 0.29 1.00 0.00 Example: For a set of 4 positive examples, and 1 negative example (written E[4, 1]), the ratio p = 4 5, or 0.80. The corresponding entropy value is given by the table as 0.72. Always round the ratio to the nearest value on the table, for example: For E[2, 1], the ratio is p = 2 3 ≃ 0.67 ≃ 0.65, which makes the E[2, 1] = 0.93. © UNISA 2021","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
