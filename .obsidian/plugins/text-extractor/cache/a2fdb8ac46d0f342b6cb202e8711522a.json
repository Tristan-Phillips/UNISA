It is thus a matter of personal learning, and growth. Please don’t leave them to the last minute, and above all: please put in honest, own eﬀort when completing them. ASSIGNMENT 1 Due Date: 29 May 2023 Total Marks: 132 Unique Assignment Number: 533732 ALL STUDENTS Study material: Chapters 1 to 4. You may skip sections 4.2 and 4.5. Important: When we use the phrase ‘deﬁne’, we are looking for a formal deﬁnition a formal mathematical notation, and not simply an English description or deﬁnition. For example: ‘Deﬁne the initial state for an agent in Johannesburg’. Answer: In(Johannesburg). ‘Deﬁne the actions avail- able to this agent given that the agent simply moves between major metropolitan areas’. Answer: Actions(In(Johannesburg)) = {Go(Bloemontein), Go(Durban), . . . }. When we want an English deﬁ- nition we will explicitly ask for it. Question 1: 11 Marks (1.1) (4)Explain the diﬀerence between fully observable and a partially observable environment. (1.2) (4)Explain the diﬀerence between a Deterministic and Stochastic environment. (1.3) (3)Classify the following environments as deterministic or stochastic: 1. Chess 2. Soccer 3. Self-driving car Question 2: 22 Marks (2.1) (5)Discuss well-deﬁned problems in terms of its ﬁve components. (2.2) (2)Diﬀerentiate between search space and goal space. (2.3) (1)What is the purpose of the explored set? (2.4) (6)Explain why it is possible for the state space in an environment to be ﬁnite, while the search space could become inﬁnite. 2 COS3751/102/0/2023 (2.5) (8)Discuss the four components of the data structure used by search algorithms. Question 3: 30 Marks Three (3) siblings, Anele, Busi and Chan, took part in a chocolate Easter egg hunt. Anele found 15 chocolate eggs, Busi found 9 eggs, and Chan found 6 eggs. They realise that they only have one basket and one bicycle to carry the eggs back home. They are slightly jealous of each other (as siblings sometimes are) and they do not want to mix ‘their’ eggs with those of the others. The bicycle can carry either two kids, or one kid and the basket. If a kid is left alone with more eggs than his or her own share, or if two kids are left alone with more eggs than their accumulated shares, the kids will eat the excess (or at least that they all fear, so they want to avoid such a situation). The kids need to devise a strategy to carry all the eggs while keeping their own individual shares (3.1) (8)Deﬁne a state using a mathematical notation (pictures or any form of graphical notation will not be accepted). Discuss the appropriateness of your choice, and provide an example to show that it will be suitable to be employed during a search. (3.2) (4)Deﬁne the start and goal states using your representation. (3.3) (2)Deﬁne an appropriate cost function or functions for this problem. (3.4) (8)Provide a formal deﬁnition of a valid action function for this problem – you need not provide a formal deﬁnition for the operation of the function. Discuss the operation of the function and provide an example to illustrate its use. (3.5) (8)Find a solution to the problem. Question 4: 12 Marks (4.1) (4)Discuss the diﬀerences between a tree and graph search. (4.2) (4)How does Breadth First Search (BFS) rate in terms of the four criteria for measuring the performance of problem solving? (4.3) (4)Consider an example of a sliding-block puzzle game state provided below (Figure 1). How many distinct states are there for puzzles of this sort? How many search nodes? Explain how you reached your answer. Question 5: 6 Marks Consider the search tree in Figure 2. (5.1) (6)Show the order in which the nodes will be expanded (from limit 0 to limit 4) given that IDS is used. Assume the goal node is N , and that nodes are expanded from left to right. 3 A B E I F H C N G J L M O K D Figure 1: Sliding-block puzzle D C B A H I L M E J N O F K G Figure 2: Search Tree (Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)) Question 6: 16 Marks Consider the graph in Figure 3. (6.1) (4)Explain the concept of Uniform Cost Search (UCS). Provide an example to aid your discussion (6.2) (12)Suppose we start at X and the goal is T . Write down the nodes in the order they are expanded. Show your steps and calculations. The step cost between nodes is provided next to the edges in the graph. Question 7: 4 Marks (7.1) (4)Diﬀerentiate between an admissible and a consistent heuristic. 4 COS3751/102/0/2023 Z Y X W V U T S 11 20 15 4 24 22 14 12 9 Figure 3: Search Graph (Uniform Cost Search (UCS)) Question 8: 31 Marks Consider Figure 4 and Table 1 and answer the questions that follow. Table 1 provides the straight-line distances (SLD) from each city to PTA, as an estimate (thus ˆh for each node). The label next to each edge provides the cost between cities (thus ˆg).

List the nodes in the order in which they are expanded (not generated). Show your steps (don’t just list the nodes, explain the reason for each choice). (8.2) (4)When adding nodes to the frontier (during the search), is it enough to simply add nodes from the state space to the frontier? Justify your answer. (8.3) (10)Provide the content of the frontier at the time the search terminates. (8.4) (7)Is the heuristic being applied consistent? Justify your answer by providing proof from the graph. © UNISA 2023 6","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
