Property: Associativity For all positive integers m, n and k, addition and multiplication are associative. This means that (@) m+(n+k) = (m+n)+k (i.e. addition is associative) (b) (m)(nk) = (mn)(k) (i.e. multiplication is associative) Bookkeepers often have to add up long lists of numbers. Some like to start at the top of the list and work downwards. Others like to start at the bottom of the list and work upwards. Do you know why they get the same answers?","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
