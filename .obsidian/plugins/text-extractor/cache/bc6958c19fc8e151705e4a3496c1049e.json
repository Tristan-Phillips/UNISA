Which search strategy should we use, Greedy-Best-First or A*? If A*, which node is the initial (root) node? You cannot calculate PATH-cost if you don’t know where the root is! Let’s ASSUME that A* should be used, and that node a is the start node. Expanding a gives -6 ] -8 H or=15 & o Next; e has the lowest f-cost, so it will be expanded next: =9 2 s H fib)=19 P Finally, expanding node d: _@ M=o 2 ) H 2 fib) =19 ﬂ() -n o fil=14 Notice that k is already on the frontier.
