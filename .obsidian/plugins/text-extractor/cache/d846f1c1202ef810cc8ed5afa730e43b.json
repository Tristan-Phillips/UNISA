Evidence shows that the learner understand the organisation structure and challenges Describing the organisation situation  Organisation full address (Name, Physical address and contact number)  Organisation mission or business objectives  Organisation general operating environment.  Organisation structure 0 = No description of the organisation situation 2 = 1/4 of the organisation situation is covered in the description or analysis. = 1/2 of the organisation situation is covered in the description or analysis. = 3/4 of the organisation situation are covered in the description or analysis. = All the data elements in organisation situation are covered but with a narrow or inadequate description. = All the data elements in the organisation situation are included with adequate description Defining problems and constraints  Description of the challenges facing the organisation  Identify the project constraints 0 = No problem or constraints define 1 = Both Problem(s) and constraints clearly defined but are not database related. = Only problem defined or only constraint defined = Only problem(s) or constraint clearly defined . 3 = Both Problem(s) and constraints identify but not clearly defined. 4 = Both Problem(s) and constraints clearly defined but are not relevant to the organisation. = Both Problem(s) and constraints well defined and relevant to the organisation.

Project scope and boundaries permission 0 = No scope and boundaries of the project 0 = Scope and boundaries defined but are not relevant to the database problem defined= Only scope or boundaries is defined 1 = Some scope and boundaries listed but not clearly define. = 1/2 of the concepts (scope and boundaries) discussed are relevant to the database problem identified but are not clearly defined and are too broad= 1/2 of the concepts discussed are relevant to the problem identified. = All the concepts discussed but they are not relevant to the problem identified.= All the concepts discussed are relevant to the problem identified, clearly defined and not too broad OUTCOME 2 Illustrate the Evidence shows that the learner Source of information 0 = No Source of information 1 = Source of information provided not adequate Page 2 of 6 Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 ability to locate the sources of information and extract the relevant information for the database design did identify sources information and gathered useful information to formulate Business rules 2 = Source of information provided relevant 4 = Source of information provided relevant and well presented. Information collected and processed 0 = All the concepts discussed but they are not relevant to the problem identified = Provided inadequate explanation on how the information was collected or processed = Provided adequate explanation on how information was collected or processed = Provided inadequate explanation for the collection and processing of information = Provided adequate explanation for collection and processing of information. = Provided sufficient explanation on information collection and processing Business rules proposed 0 = No business rules 2 = Business rules proposed/reported are ambiguous= Business rules proposed/reported are unambiguous = Business rules proposed unambiguous and well- presented but not complete.= Business rules proposed/reported are unambiguous and well presented but some elements are missing OUTCOME 3 Demonstrate a good understanding of principles underpinning the development of database models Evidence shows student discuss and explain the design approach used Database Design approach 0 = No design approach 1 = Discussion of database design approaches 2 = Design approach do not correlate with problem 3 = Adequate design approach without justification 4 = Adequate design approach with justification Evidence shows Conceptual Database Design 0 = No conceptual design Page 3 of 6 Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 and proposed adequate database design model that the student developed a conceptual database design  Main entities  Primary and foreign keys  Normalised entities  ER diagram 1 = 1/4 of the elements covered with limited description.2 = 1/4 of the elements covered with adequate description = 1/2 of the elements covered with limited description 4 = 1/2 of the elements covered with adequate description. 5 = 3/4 of the elements covered with limited description 6 = 3/4 of the elements covered with adequate description = All the elements covered with limited description 8 = All the elements covered with sufficient description Evidence shows that the student developed a logical database design Logical database Design  Relational model  Integrity constraints 0 = No logical design 1 = 1/2 of the elements covered in with limited description. = 1/2 of the elements covered in with adequate description = All the elements covered in with limited description = All the elements covered with sufficient description Evidence shows that the student developed a physical database design Physical database Design  Composite/Transaction usage map  Estimation of hard disk space 0 = No physical design 1 = 1/2 of the elements covered in with limited description. = 1/2 of the elements covered in with adequate description = All the elements covered in with limited description = All the elements covered with sufficient description OUTCOME 4 Demonstrate the Evidence shows Define and explained transactions 0 = No definition and explanations of transactions Page 4 of 6 Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293 ability to efficiently manage database transaction at the conceptual level. learned formulate transactional queries in line with the objectives. 1 = Unclear definition or explanation of transaction 2 = Limited definition and explanation of transaction = Adequate definition or explanation of transaction= Advanced definition and explanation of transaction Formulate possible SQL statements for the database 0 = Statement not correct 0 = Limited use of SQL statements and the statements are not relevant for the database = Limited use of SQL statements 3 = Basic use of SQL statements 4 = Advanced use of SQL statements = Advanced use of SQL statements and the statements are relevant to the database OUTCOME 5 Demonstrate an understanding of methods applied to optimise database performances Evidence shows the learner proposed a database performance optimisation approach Discussion of different database performance turning methods/concepts 0 = No database performance turning discussed 1 = Limited discussion on database performance turning concepts 3 = Adequate discussion on database performance turning concepts 5 = Extensive discussion on database Performance turning concepts Present the database performance turning methods you will propose for the design or modified database and the reasons for your decisions 0 = No database performance turning proposed 1 = Performance turning approach proposed but no justification was given 3 = Performance turning proposed but justifications given are not adequate 5 = Performance turning approach proposed and justifications given are appropriate.

The pages should be numbered (bottom centre) Include table of content Use time new romans Font size 12 The paragraphs should be justified and single spacing. 0 = None of the prescribed layout and page restriction was applied = Some of the prescribed layout and page restriction was applied = Prescribe layout or page restriction applied 6 = Professional layout applied Letter of permission and declaration If the two documents are completed, signed and attached to the final report If not Award student full mark obtained for the assignment Award 0 mark to the student Case base company or real-world company As indicated in the assignment 02 information document, extra 5 marks will be awarded to students that put extra effort to find real-world organisations, schools, business, or NGOs. The reason for this is that the assignment is designed to make students gain a real-world experience for instance how to generate business requirement, © UNISA 2019 Page 6 of 6 Downloaded by Tristan Phillips (tristan@phillipsfamily.co.za) lOMoARcPSD|12886293","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
