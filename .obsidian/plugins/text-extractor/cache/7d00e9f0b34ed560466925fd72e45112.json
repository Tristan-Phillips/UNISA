[16 marks] Question 1.1 (7) a) Give the truth table for the following symbolic compound statement: ((p  q)  ¬ (p  r)  (q  r))  r b) Is the expression a tautology, a contradiction or neither? Question 1.2 (5) Write down the negation of the following expression. Simplify the expression so that the not- simbol (¬) does not occur to the left of any quantifier. The not-symbol may also not occur outside of parentheses. ∀x  Z, (x > 0)  (x  12) N.B.: Show all steps. Which is true, the original statement, the negation of it or neither? Question 1.3 (4) Given the implication P(x)  Q(x), write down a) the converse, and b) the contrapositive of the implication. After you have written down the converse and the contrapositive, simplify the expressions where possible, e.g. where negations are involved. (Hint: Use the identity A(x)  B(x) = ¬ A(x)  B(x) in the simplification process.) SECTION 2 : MATHEMATICAL PROOFS Write your answer to each question out in full in the answer book. [12 marks] Question 2.1 (3) Provide a counterexample to prove that the following statement is not true for all integers x ≥ 0. If x ≥ 0 then x2 − 2x + 3 is a multiple of 3. Question 2.2 (4) Provide a direct proof to show that, for all n  Z, if n is even, then n 3 + 2n is divisible by 4. Question 2.3 (5) Provide a proof by contrapositive to prove that, for all x  Z, if x 2 + x + 1 is even, then x is even. SECTION 3 : SET THEORY Write your answer to each question out in full in the answer book. [28 marks] Question 3.1 (10) Use Venn diagrams to determine whether, for all sets X, Y and W (X  Y)  (W – X) = (X  W)  (Y + X). If it seems to be an identity, give a proof. Otherwise give a counterexample. Question 3.2 (8) Determine whether or not the following holds for all sets X, Y and W: (W  X )  (W  Y ) = W  (X  Y) (Hint: Start your proof with (a,b)  W  (X  Y) ) Question (10) A car manufacturer uses 32 robots. Of these robots 24 are used for welding, 10 are used for painting, and 10 are used for sanding. Furthermore, some of these robots can be programmed as follows: 5 to weld and to paint, 6 to weld and to sand, and 4 to sand and to paint. Answer the following two questions: a) How many robots can perform all three functions? b) How many can only sand? SECTION 4 : SETS AND RELATIONS (Multiple-Choice Questions) Each question comprises 2 marks. Choose only one alternative per question and then write the question number and the alternative that you regard as the correct answer in the answer book.

(ii) Determine the composition S;S-1 (i.e. S -1￮ S). Question 5.2: This question in the paper is included as question E in self-assessment 2, therefore we provide another question: Let X be the set of letters of the English alphabet and let R be a relation on X such that (x, y)  R iff x has as its value a letter coming before the value of y in the usual alphabet rhyme. By doing the appropriate tests, prove that R is a total strict order relation. (Note: Do not use examples in your proof.)
