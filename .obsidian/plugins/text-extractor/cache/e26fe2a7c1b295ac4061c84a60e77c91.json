{"path":"UNISA/98906 - BSc Science in Computing/COS1501 - Theoretical Computer Science I/Unsorted/Online assessment.pdf","text":"Dear students, Your May/June exam will be an online exam, that you will be writing on myUnisa on the date and time specified in the exam timetable. We want to give you a mock exam of 10 questions only to familiarize you with the system. This will take place on 21 April at 10h00 on myUnisa. Please do your utmost best to be online at that time. Please work through this document before attempting the exam if you have never submitted an assignment via the online assessment tab. When you click on the assessment tab, you will see a screen similar to the one below: The exam for COS1501 will not be an MCQ exam, because of the fact that the online assessment system throws away the mathematical symbols, but it will be something similar. You will see the 4 options as a, b, c and d, but you then have to type the option that you think is the correct one, in the block below the question. See the following screen: Please only type a or b or c or d in the first position of the block, and nothing else. The system will match what you’ve keyed in, to the correct answer, which can only be a, b, c or d. Anything else will be incorrect. When you have typed your answer, click on the ‘next’ button, which will take you to the next question. When you reach the last question, the next button will not be active anymore. Please click ‘Save’, and then ‘Submit for grading’.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
