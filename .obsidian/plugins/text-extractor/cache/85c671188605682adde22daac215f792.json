How have various digital technologies enabled us to overcome social distance, even while physical distancing measures have been in place during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown? a. Face-to-face meetings have been replaced to a large extent by online meetings using sound and video, or sound only b. Much informal verbal communication has been replaced by texting and using emojis c. Creating, sending and forwarding humoristic video and sound clips have replaced the telling of jokes to relief stress and anxiety d. All of the above 1.7. Pilot studies are used to: a. Study user experience of the digital instruments used by airplane pilots b. Do a small trial of the main study to make sure that the proposed research method is viable c. Steer a discussion taking place during a focus group interview d. Administer the recording of HCI research data 1.8. Suppose that you have been contracted to discover the requirements of a new fitness app. Which option below describes the scenario correctly? a. An athlete wants to monitor the fitness indicators (heartbeat, calories burnt, duration) of his/her workout b. The system responsibility includes a menu of various exercises while the user intention includes starting and ending workout sessions c. The scenario lists a generalised use case showing a detailed set of the specific steps d. The scenario is rendered in technical terms, e.g. the fitness app tracks the speed, duration and number of steps, calculates the average heart rate and stores the data in the cloud-based database 1.9. The following are appropriate usability goal requirements for an interactive app that will locate places in a shopping centre and provide routes for users to reach their destinations: a. The app needs to access the GPS location data for the user, have maps of the centre and requires knowledge about pathways for disabled people b. The app should be cognitively stimulating for potential groups of users with different characteristics c. The app must be satisfying, helpful and enhance sociability amongst users d. New users must be able to use it immediately, efficiently and safely 1.10 Which definition of “hypothesis” below is correct within the context of conducting experiments during evaluation design? a. A hypothesis is a guess or prediction about the way users will perform with an interface b. A hypothesis is a t-test that validates a guess or prediction about the way users will perform with an interface c. A hypothesis reveals if the differences between experiments conducted in different conditions are significant d. A hypothesis is a dissertation that contains the results of conducted experiments 4 INF3720 JUN/JULY [Turn over] Question 2 45 marks Case study: The case study is hypothetical. Informatics Tutoring Services (ITS) is a private tutoring company in South Africa that provides tutoring services to students who are enrolled for diplomas and degrees in Information Systems at various colleges and universities. In the past, ITS’s tutors have been using WhatsApp to communicate with their students, but the company has decided to consider other options due to concerns about WhatsApp’s new terms and conditions that will be implemented in 2021. ITS considers the following alternatives: • Developing its own Africanised messaging app that will enhance the digital experience of its clients • Adopting Telegram while suggesting modifications to the owner of the app (Telegram Messenger) to localise the app for the South African market Assume that you have been appointed by ITS as an HCI expert. Management has tasked you to do a user experience evaluation of Telegram as a possible alternative. ITS decides to adopt Telegram and you have to manage all aspects of interaction design (ID) related to the possible future enhancements or alternatives planned for the South African market. Question 2.1 As an interaction designer, briefly describe interactive technologies that can be used to design the ITS app that is accessible and inclusive to meet the needs of the following group of users. Describe in point form the technologies per each group of users. (6 marks) Users Technology description (3 marks each) Blind users (persons that cannot see) Deaf users (persons that cannot hear) Question 2.2 There is a fine line between an interaction that works and that is usable. Designing interactions that work and are usable is achievable if design principles are appropriately applied. Discuss how you would apply the following principles when designing the ITS app. (15 marks) Principle Description (3 marks each) Visibility Feedback Constraints Consistency Affordance 5 INF3720 JUN/JULY [Turn over] Question 2.3 As an interaction designer for ITS, you would need to collect some requirements from the stakeholders.

Provide your answer in point form in the table below. (10 marks) Point Description (2 marks per valid point) 1 2 3 4 5 Question 3 19 marks Question 3.1 What do you understand by the term \"emotional interaction\"?

(9 marks) 6 INF3720 JUN/JULY [Turn over] Component Explanation 1. 2. 3. 3.3 You want to buy the above watch for your teenager. Assume that the watch has sports functions, including measuring heart rate and recording sport activities. You are concerned about the usability of the watch. List any four usability questions that you would ask before buying the watch in the following table? (8 marks) Usability questions 1. 2. 3. 4 Question 4 6 marks Interviews can be viewed as a conversation with a purpose between two or more people where questions are asked by the interviewer to get facts or clarity from the interviewee. Interviews are mostly used for requirements gathering during product design or for testing the usability of a product. In point form, describe the characteristics of structured interviews and focus groups in the followig table. (6 marks) Structured interview characteristics Focus group characteristics 1. 1. 2. 2. 3. 3.
