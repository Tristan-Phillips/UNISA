INTRODUCTION Assignment submission • Most questions require a GUI. You must hand-code the GUI – all layouts etc. ◦ Please note that Qt Designer should not be used, and you are expected to manually set up GUIs to ensure that you properly handle memory using Qt’s parent-child functionality. ◦ Marks will also be awarded for following good programming practice (naming conventions, code layout, using initialiser lists in constructors, and GUI handling like setting focus, tabbing and clearing data entry placeholders, and providing appropriate user feedback). • Unique numbers – there are different Unique numbers for each Assignment. INTRODUCTION Assignment submission • Please post any queries with regard to the Assignments in the appropriate Forum Topic on myUnisa. • Solutions to the Assignments will be posted in Additional Resources after the closing date – TL 201, TL 202, and TL 203. • Prescribed software – Qt 5.
