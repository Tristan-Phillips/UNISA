(how to understand/use product). 2) The concepts that people are exposed to through the product. (task domain objects, their attributes and operations). 3) The relationship between those concepts. 4) The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke. 4) Expressive/Frustrating interfaces and persuasive technologies (ass_1): Expressive interfaces convey emotional states & elicit certain kinds of emotional responses in users, such as feeling at ease, comfort, and happiness. E.g. emoticons, sounds, icons, visual agents, animations, vibration feedback, spoken messages. Frustrating interfaces: application not working or crashing, user expectations not met, application does not do what the users wants, vague error messages, gimmicky, patronizing, too many steps to do a task, insufficient info. o Typical reasons for frustration when using a mobile phone: ▪ Application does not work properly. e.g. freezing, needing reboot. ▪ Doesn't do what users want it to, e.g. auto correct. ▪ Not sufficient information, e.g. help documentation is unhelpful. ▪ Vague/obtuse error messages, e.g. “system not available, try later”, when must I try again? What should I do to fix.? ▪ Voice commands (accents). ▪ Website/app long loading time. ▪ Upgrading software. Takes time and changes the way your used to doing things. ▪ Mobile websites that are overloaded by text and graphics. ▪ Typing on a phone's default on-screen keyboard can be frustrating due to errors. Persuasive technologies are technologies designed to change people’s attitude or behavior or both without using coercion or deception. E.g. pop-ups, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages, etc. 5) Empirical Measurement (mentioned in ass_1): The reactions and performance of intended users to printed scenarios, manuals etc. is observed and measured. Specific usability and user experience goals should be identified, documented, and agreed upon at the beginning of the project, they can be empirically evaluated at regular stages as it is developed. 6) Iterative Design (mentioned in ass_1): Design and development is iterative, with cycles of design, testing, measuring, redesign being repeated. Iteration allows for refinement based on feedback. Iteration is inevitable, designers are unlikely to get the entire solution correct the first time. 7) FS and UT (from assignment 2): • Environment: - Field studies: Natural environment/ Usability testing: laboratory (controlled conditions). • Number of participants: - Field studies: 1, or even thousands. Usability testing: 5 – 12 are acceptable. • Regarding data collection methods: - Usability testing: ➢ The focus is primarily on the product. ➢ Data collection includes, interviews, user tests and user satisfaction questionnaires. ➢ Variables are controlled. ➢ Data is captured through video recording, thinking aloud is encouraged, observations, questionnaires/surveys and structured/semi-structured interviews. - Field testing: ➢ The focus is on user, environment and system/product. ➢ Qualitative, includes observations, focus groups as well as interviews. ➢ Variables are not controlled. ➢ Data is captured via audio/video recording, field notes being taken/diaries. • Advantages and disadvantages: - Usability testing (advantages): ➢ Feedback direct from target audience. ➢ Variables can be controlled. ➢ Security of sensitive data may be enforced. ➢ Able to capture user’s reactions through body language/gestures. - Usability testing (disadvantages): ➢ Studies are in a simulated environment. ➢ Simulation of the use setting is very hard/time consuming/costly and sometimes impossible to attain. ➢ Users are taken out of context. - Field testing (advantages): ➢ Eliminates both the need for a lab and lab effects on participants. ➢ Diversity in participants. ➢ Usually less expensive than usability testing. - Field testing (disadvantages): ➢ Sensitive data can be compromised. ➢ Unable to view the user’s body language/gestures. ➢ Technical difficulties such as network speed/inability to share screens/inability or unwillingness of participants to use special equipment or download certain software/plugins. 8) Definition of & three stages of heuristic evaluation: Heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method in which experts, guided by a set of usability principles known as heuristics, evaluate whether user-interface elements, such as dialogue boxes, menus, navigation structure, online help etc. conform to tried and tested principles. • Three stages: - The briefing session – In which experts are told what to do. - The evaluation period – In which each expert typically spends 1-2 hours independently inspecting the product, using the heuristics for guidance. The experts need at least two passes through the interface. - The debriefing session – In which the evaluators come together to discuss their findings. 9) Types of pleasure: • Physio-pleasure – Bodily pleasures e.g. touch, taste, and smell. An example is the tactile pleasure of holding a sleek cell phone. • Socio-pleasure – Enjoyment of being in the company of others. E.g. showing one another photos on a digital camera. • Psycho-pleasure – Emotional/cognitive reactions. E.g. emotionally satisfying experience of shopping on the web using an on-line site that is both pleasing and easy to use. • Ideo-pleasure (cognitive) – refers to peoples’ values. E.g. using a “green” product. 10) Triangulation definition and types: • Definition: Triangulation is a term used to refer to the investigation of a phenomenon from (at least) two different perspectives. • Four types of triangulation: 1) Triangulation of data - means that data is drawn from different sources at different times, in different places, or from different people. 2) Investigator triangulation - means that different researchers have been used to collect and interpret the data. 3) Triangulation of theories - means the use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view the data or findings. 4) Methodological triangulation - means to employ different data gathering techniques. Most common form of triangulation. 11) Usability goals and user experience goals (http://www.sharritt.com/CISHCIExam/preece.html) - Usability: Refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the users’ perspective. It involves optimizing the interactions people have with interactive products to enable them to carry out their activities at work, school, and in their everyday lives. - Usability goals (EESULM): • Effectiveness: How good a product is at doing what it’s supposed to. • Efficiency: The way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks. • Safety: Protecting users from dangerous conditions / undesirable situations. • Utility: Extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality. • Learnability: How easy a system is to learn to use. • Memorability: How easy a product is to remember how to use. - User experience goals: • User experience goals: User experience is what the interaction with the system feels like to the users (subjectively). User experience goals differ from the more objective usability goals in that they are concerned with how users experience an interactive product from their own perspective, rather than assessing how useful or productive a system is from its own perspective. • Desirable aspects (User experience goals): o Satisfying, Enjoyable, Engaging, Pleasurable, Exciting, Entertaining, Helpful, Motivating, Challenging, Enhancing sociability, Supporting creativity, Cognitively stimulating, Fun, Provocative, Surprising, Rewarding, Emotionally fulfilling. • Undesirable aspects (User experience goals): o Boring, Frustrating, Making one feel guilty, Annoying, Childish, Unpleasant, Patronizing, Making one feel stupid, Cutesy, Gimmicky 12) Nielsen’s 10 usability principles (AKA heuristics): ➢ Visibility of system status (Keep users informed). ➢ Match between system and real world (System should speak the users’ language). ➢ User control and freedom (Users need a clearly marked emergency exit). ➢ Consistency and standards (Different actions/situations with same effect should not require guess work). ➢ Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors (error messages should be in plain language, indicate the problem, and suggest a solution). ➢ Error prevention (Careful design is better than error messages). ➢ Recognition rather than recall (minimize the users' memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible). ➢ Flexibility and efficiency of use (accelerators – for advanced users). ➢ Aesthetic and minimalist design (dialogues should not have irrelevant info). ➢ Help and documentation. 13) Norman’s design principles • Visibility - The more visible functions are, the more likely users will know what to do next. • Feedback - Sending back information about action performed what has been accomplished. In audio, tactile, verbal, visual and combinations of these forms. • Constraints - refers to determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interactions that can take place at a given moment. E.g. deactivating certain menu options, physical design of slots/plugs. • Consistency - Interfaces should have similar operations/elements for achieving similar tasks. Easier to learn and use. • Affordance - \"to give a clue\". e.g. mouse button invites pushing, a door handle affords pulling. 14) Three common data recording approaches: • Taking notes is the most flexible way of recording data. Audio can be a useful alternative to note taking and is less intrusive than video. Video has the advantage of capturing both visual and audio data, but has some additional planning issues, and can be intrusive. 15) Paradigms, theories, models and frameworks (Other sources of inspiration to inform design and guide research) • Paradigms – General approach adopted by a community of researchers/designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions/concepts/values/practices. • Theory – Is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspects of a phenomenon. • Model – Is a simplification of some aspect of human-computer interaction. • Framework – Set of inter-related concepts/questions intended to inform a particular domain area, on-line communities, or analytic method. 16) Fitts’ law: • Predicts the time it takes to reach a target using a pointing device (based on size/distance). • Benefits: helps designers decide button location/size/how close together they should be on screen display. • T = k log2 (D/S + 1.0) where: T = time to move the pointer to a target, D = distance between pointer and target S = size of the target, k is a constant of approx. 200ms/bit. • In short, the bigger the target, the easier and quicker it is to reach it. • Predicts that the most quickly accessed targets on a display are the 4 screen corners. 17) GOMS: GOMS aims to model the knowledge and cognitive processes used when users interact with a system. • Goals - refer to a state the user wants to achieve (e.g. find a website) • Operators - refer to the cognitive processes/physical actions that need to be performed to attain those goals (e.g. decide which search engine to use). Goals obtained, operators are executed. • Methods - are learned procedures for accomplishing the goals. • Selection rules - are used to determine which method to select. • Benefits and Limitations of GOMS - Benefits Allows for comparative analysis to be performed. KLM can be adapted for use with advanced cell phones. - Limitations Not often used for evaluation purposes because of its highly limited scope. It is intended to be used only for predicting expert performance Does not allow for errors to be modelled. 18) KLM Differs from GOMS in that it provides numerical predictions of user performance. Tasks can be compared in terms of the time it takes to perform them when using different strategies. Main benefit: different features can be compared to see which may be most effective for a task. This model allows for predictions to be made about how long it takes an expert user to perform a task. The predicted time is computed by: T(execute) = Tk + Tp + Th + Td + Tm + Tr Operators - K (keystroke); P (pointing); H (homing); D (drawing); M (mental preparation); R (system response time). 19) Interface metaphors: Are considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. They provide a structure that is similar in some ways to aspects of a familiar entity/s, but also have their own behaviors and properties. It is instantiated in some way as part of the user interface. e.g. the desktop metaphor, the search engine. 20) Anthropomorphism: Attributing human qualities to animals and objects. 21) Utility: The extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to do. 22) Persuasive technology: Refers to interactive computing systems that are deliberately designed to change peoples’ attitudes and behaviors. e.g. pop-up ads, warning messages, reminders, prompts, personalized messages and recommendations. 23) 5 key issues for any data gathering session to become successful: 1) Setting goals. 2) Identifying participants. 3) Relationship with participants. (Clear and professional) 4) Triangulation. 5) Pilot studies. 24) Things to keep in mind when designing interview questions: Avoid ambiguous questions/emotional language/jargon/bias/yes-no questions/questions unrelated to interview goals Ask 1 question at a time Questions should follow some order Type of data recording technique should not interfere with the interview proceeding 25) Advantages of involving users during software development: The best way to ensure that development takes users’ activities into account is to involve real users throughout development. In this way, developers can gain a better understanding of users’ goals, leading to a more appropriate, more usable product. Expectation management & ownership. 26) Reasons users feel frustration with computers: When an application doesn’t work properly. When a system doesn’t do what a user wants it to do. When a users’ expectations are not met. When a system does not provide sufficient information to let the user know what to do. When error messages pop up that are vague or unhelpful. When the appearance of an interface is too noisy, garish, gimmicky, or patronizing. When a system requires users to carry out too many steps to perform a task. 27) ‘Focus on users and tasks early’ 5 sub-principles: Users’ tasks and goals are the driving force behind the development, not technology. Users’ behavior and context of use are studied and the system is designed to support them. Users’ characteristics are captured and designed for. Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to the latest, and their input is seriously considered. All design decisions are taken within the context of the users, their work, and their environment. 28) 4 main types of interviews: 1) Unstructured interviews: Exploratory/more like conversations around a particular topic. Advisable to have an agenda. Open to new ideas. 2) Structured interviews: Predetermined questions like a questionnaire, standardized questions for all participants. 3) Semi-structured interviews: Combine features of structured and unstructured interviews. 4) Focus groups: Normally 3 – 10 people (form the sample) and a facilitator.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
