Which one of the following statements provides the converse of the given statement? 1. If n is a multiple of 3, then 3n2 + 6n + 9 is even. 2. If n is not a multiple of 3, then 3n2 + 6n + 9 is odd. 3. If 3n2 + 6n + 9 is even, then n is a multiple of 3. 4. If 3n2 + 6n + 9 is odd, then n is not a multiple of 3. Question 47 Consider the statement If n is even, then 4n2 + 2n – 7 is odd. Which one of the following statements provides the contrapositive of the given statement? 1. If n is odd, then 4n2 + 2n – 7 is even. 2. If 4n2 + 2n – 7 is even, then n is odd. 3. If 4n2 + 2n – 7 is odd, then n is even. 4. If n is odd, then 4n2 + 2n – 7 is odd.

Let n be a multiple of 3, then n = 3k, for some k  Z. ie (3k)2 + 3(3k) + 5, ie 9k2 + 9k + 5, which can be written as (9k2 + 9k + 6) – 1, ie 3(3k2 + 3k + 2), which is a multiple of 3. 2. Assume that n is not a multiple of 3. We then have to prove that n2 + 3n + 5 is also not a multiple of 3, Let n = 3k + 1, (because n = 3k is a multiple of 3), ie (3k + 1)2 + 3(3k + 1) + 5, ie 9k2 + 6k + 1 + 9k + 3 + 5, ie 9k2 + 15k + 9, ie 3(3k2 + 5k + 3), which is a multiple of 3. Our original assumption that n + 1 is not a multiple of 3 is therefore not true, ie we can deduce that the original statement is false. 3. Let n + 1 = 3, which is a multiple of 3, then n = 3 – 1 = 2, then n2 + 3n + 5 ie (2)2 + 3(2) + 5, ie 18 ie 3(6), which is a multiple of 3. 4. Let n + 1 be a multiple of 3, then n + 1 = 3k, for some k  Z, then n = 3k – 1, then n2 + 3n + 5 ie (3k – 1)2 + 3(3k – 1) + 5, ie 9k2 – 6k + 1 + 9k – 3 + 5 ie 9k2 + 3k + 3 ie 3(3k2 + k + 1), which is a multiple of 3.

Which one of the following alternatives contains the correct way to start a contrapositive proof to prove the statement? 1. Let x be odd, then x = 2k + 1 for some k  Z, ie x3 - 2x = (2k + 1)3 – 2(2k +1), ie ……….. 2. Let x be even, then x = 2k for some k  Z, ie x3 - 2x = (2k)3 – 2(2k), ie ……….. 3. Assume x3 - 2x is odd, then x can be odd or even. We will assume that x is even. Let x be even, then x = 2k for some k  Z, ie ……….. 4. Let x3 - 2x be odd, We know that an odd number minus an even number is odd, ie x3 must be odd, because odd * odd * odd is odd, ie let x = 2k + 1 for some k  Z, ie ………..
