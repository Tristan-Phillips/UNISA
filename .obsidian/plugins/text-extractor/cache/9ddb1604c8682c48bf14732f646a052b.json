Since the range of [ is defined to be a subset of the codomain, we know that flal= B For equality, we also require that B < f{A]. So f: A — B is surjective iff for every b & B, we can find some a € A such that b = f{a). Activity 7-3: Surjective functions Explain in your own words what it means when a function is surjective. Do you agree that g: 7 —» 7 defined by g(x) = x + 5 is surjective because glZ] = 77 (Determine g[ 7] as shown in a previous example.) And do you agree that f: 7 —» 7 defined by f(x) = 2x is not surjective because f[Z] # 72 (Provide a counterexample as shown in a previous example. People often say f maps onto B when they want to explain what it means when a function is surjective. An example of a surjective function would be the following: LetA={1,2,3}and B={5,7}. Define f: A — B by f{1)=5,f(2) =5,and f(3) = 7, then fis the function {(1, 5), (2,5).(3.7)}. Clearly flA] = {5, 7} = B. Note: The range of £, Le. [A], is the set {5, 7} - one cannot merely give 5, 7 as the range.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
