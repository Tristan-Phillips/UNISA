BARCODE 2 Note that this memo provides a guideline on how the students were expected to answer the assignment questions. The solutions provided in this memo are skeletal, that is, they are the main points that are expected in an answer. Only giving the main points would result in a student getting half the marks allocated to the question. To get full marks, students are expected to apply what they learnt and understood to a given situation. Assignment 02 [70 marks] Question 1 [30 marks] This question takes you through the complete development lifecycle for an interactive product. You are required to design and evaluate an interactive product for booking tickets online for a cinema. A user is supposed to be able to book a venue for watching a movie. Most cinema venues have an online booking facility already but it can be awkward and frustrating to identify and book the seats you want. In order for you to successfully answer this question, study the model answer provided under additional resources (Assignment 02 – Question 01.pdf) 1.1 Identify users’ needs (requirements) for the online facility. To identify user needs, you should collect data from the users. Record your data carefully. (5 marks) 1.2 Based on the user requirements, choose a user profile and produce one persona and one scenario for each, capturing how the user is expected to interact with the product. (5 marks) 1.3 Perform a task analysis on the main tasks associated with the ticket booking system, i.e booking a ticket. (10 marks) 1.4 Using the data gathered in 1.1 and your subsequent analysis, identify different kinds of requirements for the product under the following headings: environmental, user and usability. (10 marks) Answer 1.1 Identify users’ needs (requirements) for the online facility. To identify user needs, you should collect data from the users. Record your data carefully. (5 marks) The form of data gathering students use will depend on circumstances that they encounter. There are plenty of people to talk to about how they obtain tickets for an event and gather their requirements needs. Hence, students are expected to provide a variety of answers to this question. Allocate 1 mark per requirement need identified by a student. 1.2 Based on the user requirements, choose a user profile and produce one persona and one scenario for each, capturing how the user is expected to interact with the product. (5 marks) Students are expected to provide a user profile and produce one persona, then describe a scenario in detail, capturing how the user is expected to interact with a system, for example, a ticket booking system. The persona and scenario described by the students should be different from the one given below. Any student who provide a persona and a scenario that shows evidence of copying the one given below, penalise the student. Allocate 5 marks Answer One user profile is a male student aged 17 who is partially deaf. A scenario for this user might be. \"Dan enjoys taking part in virtual chat environments. Late one night, he is in conversation with someone who recommends that he go and see the latest James Bond movie which has just come out. It's too late to INF3720 3 phone the local cinema to see if it's on there, so he decides to use the internet to obtain some tickets for the following weekend. At the cinema website he looks for the film titles currently showing. The structure of the site is quite clear, and it's possible to go straight to the information about films and showing times. The James Bond movie is indeed showing. From this page, he can indicate the time of his choice and order the tickets. He chooses the 7pm performance, but the system tells him that this is fully-booked and offers him alternatives: the 5.30pm and the 8pm showings both have available seats. The system displays the seating plan for the cinema which shows the available seats for each showing, and how much each costs. Dan then chooses the seats and showing time that he wants, confirms the booking, and pays for it. As he is partially deaf, he needs to double-check that the cinema is equipped with suitable sound amplification technology that links in to his hearing aid. Having completed his order, he returns to chatting with his friends.\" 1.3 Perform a task analysis on the main tasks associated with the ticket booking system, i.e booking a ticket. (10 marks) Allocate 2 marks per task identified by a student for any five tasks. Answer The tasks Dan was involved with were: 1. Finding if the film was on at the cinema 2. Finding out the times of the showing 3. Choosing the showing 4. Choosing the seat 5. Confirming the booking 6. Paying for the booking 7. Checking for other facilities at the cinema Note that this is not a complete HTA, but is a starting point. 1.4 Using the data gathered in 1.1 and your subsequent analysis, identify different kinds of requirements for the product under the following headings: environmental, user and usability. (10 marks) Allocate 4 marks the environment, 3 marks for user and 3 marks for usability Answer Some basic considerations and example requirements from this scenario are given below. Your scenarios may be very different, and will hence yield very different requirements: Environmental (physical, social, organisational, technical) The user might be in a variety of physical settings, and at different times of day, e.g. at home, in the street, in the rain, etc. In our scenario Dan was probably sitting at a desktop computer but he could have been using a cell phone. User There are potentially many different kinds of user. You must decide who your website is targeted for: 4 children under 18? only adults with a credit card? What about visually impaired users, or the elderly who may have difficulties controlling their movement? Usability The website should be usable the first time, without any training. This is an expression of the Volere requirement for the functional requirement. Question 2 [20 marks] Compare usability testing (UT) and field studies (FS) under the following headings: 2.1 The environment in which the evaluation is conducted (3 marks). 2.2 The number of participants (2 marks). 2.3 Data collection methods (3 marks). 2.4 Advantages and disadvantages. (12 marks) Answer 2.1 The environment in which the evaluation is conducted (Allocate 2 marks for difference between UT and FS, and extra 1 mark for the use of examples)  Field Studies: conducted in the natural environment where the system or product is used.  Usability testing: conducted in a laboratory where the conditions are controlled. 2.2 The participants. (Allocate 2 marks)  For Usability Testing, 5 to12 users are an acceptable number.  For Field Studies may include thousands or even just one participant. 2.3 Data collection. ((Allocate 2 marks for difference between UT and FS, and extra 1 mark for the use of examples) Usability testing  Laboratory user test captured through video recording of body gestures, think aloud, observations, interviews and user satisfaction questionnaire Field testing  Data collection is mostly by qualitative, involving observations, focus groups and interviews. Data is captured through audio and video recording, taking field notes, filling diaries 2.4 Advantages and disadvantages. (Allocate marks as follows: 3 marks Usability testing advantages, 3 marks Usability testing disadvantages, 3 marks Field testing advantages, 3 marks Field testing disadvantages.) Advantages Disadvantages Usability testing  Feedback is direct from target audience  Variables are controllable  Security of sensitive data be  Laboratory based usability studies capture a snapshot of the use in a simulated use environment.  Simulating the use setting is very INF3720 5 enforced  Ability to capture user reactions through body gestures, language and facial expression of participants. hard, time consuming, expensive and sometimes impossible to attain  users are isolated from contextual factors  new electronic devices are used in a context, in which multitasking is a key factor  evaluating use experience developed over time instead of snapshot of use provides more reliable information Field testing  Eliminates both the need for a lab environment and the effect of a lab environment on participants  Accommodates diverse groups of participants  Generally is less expensive than a traditional in-person lab testing  It is an opportunity to administer the test to a larger group of people than you might be able to accommodate in a lab environment  Security could be compromised if testing sensitive, privileged, or intellectual property  Restricted or no view of the user’s body language might inhibit some of the cues to their reactions to the material being tested  Technical difficulties are likely if users:  Are not comfortable with the technology involved  Have conflicting software or equipment on their machines  Are unable to share their screen over the Internet  Have unreliable or slow connection speeds  If your test requires special equipment or software downloads or plug-ins which the participants may be unwilling or unable to download Question 3 [20 marks] Go to myUnisa under Additional resources and download the file “Habla Espanol.pdf”.
