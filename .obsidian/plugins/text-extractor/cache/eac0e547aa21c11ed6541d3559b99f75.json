Due date 14 March 2016 Question 1 Explain the following terms with respect to interaction design: 1.1 Usability (2 marks) - Refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective, enjoy able from the users’ perspective. Usability goals are effective, efficiency, safety, utility, learnability and memorability 1.2 User experience (2 marks) - How a product behaves and is used by people in real world. It is about how people feel about a product and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, opening and closing it. 1.3 Problem space (2 marks) - Is conceptualizing and understanding what the user’s current experience or the product is and how it is to be changed or improved. And involves thinking through how ideas will support or extend the way people interact and communicate. 1.4 Conceptual model (2 marks) - A high level description of how a system is organized and operates. - An abstraction outlining what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact with it. - A framework of general concepts and their interrelations. 1.5 Interface metaphors (2 marks) - Metaphor = “A thing considered representative of another thing” - Are considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. They provide a structure that is similar in some ways to aspects of a familiar entity/s, but that also have their own behaviours and properties. Such models can be based on an activity / object / both. It is instantiated in some way as part of the user interface e.g.: the desktop metaphor, the search engine. - Are intended to provide familiar entities that enable people to readily understand the underlying conceptual model and know what to do at an interface. 1.6 Interaction design (2 marks) - \"Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives\". – Preece • It is about creating user experiences that enhance and augment the way people work, communicate, and interact. 1.7 Anthropomorphism (2 marks) - attributing human qualities to objects - Has been used in interaction design and the implications of designing applications that have human-like qualities. A number of virtual characters and robot pets are described that 4 have been developed to motivate people to learn, buy, and listen and we consider how useful and appropriate they are. 1.8 Paradigm (2 marks) - refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices; - Interaction paradigms include: the WIMP interface, ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing, wearable computing, tangible bits, attentive environments, and the Workaday World 1.9 Theory (2 marks) - Explanation of a phenomenon – e.g. information processing that explains how the mind, or some aspect of it, is assumed to work - Can help identify factors – e.g. cognitive, social, and affective, relevant to the design and evaluation of interactive products 1.10 Framework (2 marks) - A framework is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions - Frameworks tend to be prescriptive, providing designers with concepts, questions, and principles to consider Question 2 (Chapter 2) 2.1 Identify and describe the four types of interaction (10 marks). (Allocate 1 mark for defining the type of instruction, 1 mark for the benefits for each interaction and ½ a mark for an example of a system that implemented the interaction. This constitutes a full description) Four types of interaction are: - Instructing o This is where a user instructs a system and tells it what to do, for example, giving instructions to a system to print a document. o The benefit of this type of interaction is that it supports quick and efficient interaction. o Various systems were designed based on this model, for example computers, radios, TVs, etc. - Conversing o This is where users would have a dialog with a system. o The system acts as a dialog partner and impersonates a human being. o The systems are commonly used in help systems, advisory systems, some vending machines as well as toys and computer games. Interaction through conversation is currently supported through voice recognition, interactive voice response systems through mobile phones. o The advantage of conversation model is that it allows people to interact with a system in a way that is familiar to them, talking. o The disadvantage of the model is that voice interaction can be one sided, for example, automated phone based system that use auditory menus to advance he 4 interaction. - Manipulating o This is where users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them. The manipulation is informed by how users manipulate physical objects in real world. o Manipulation can be achieved by using physical controllers, eg. A mouse or air gestures to control movements of on a screen avatar. This is common is virtual games, robot controlled machinery and GUI computers. o Direct manipulation (DM) framework influenced the design of GUI based computers. o Advantages of DM interfaces are:  Enable users to learn and work rapidly on the system (learnability)  Allow users to remember how to carry out operations (memorability)  Minimize errors  Increases user confidence and reduces anxiety - Exploring o This is where users move through a virtual or a physical environment. o Sensors are used in physical environments to enable people to interact with an environment, for example, fire sensors, motion sensors etc. o Virtual worlds, especially through 3D have been implemented to provide spaces for learning, play games and fantasy. o The advantage of exploration model is that it provides:  Authentic exploration of objects that may not be readily available to universities.  Build models that students can interact with during demonstrations.  Interact with models of complex structures 2.2 List the advantages and disadvantages of metaphors (10 marks). (Allocate 1 mark per point, a maximum of 5 for benefits and 5 for limitations. Note that the listed benefits and limitations are not complete.) - A metaphor is a conceptual model that has been developed to be similar in some way to aspects of a physical entity but also has its own behaviours and properties. Benefits - Interface metaphors are based on conceptual models that combine familiar knowledge with new concepts, hence, helps users can easily understand the underlying model. - Exploit user’s familiar knowledge, helping them to understand the unfamiliar, hence, makes learning new systems easier. - It is easier to learn and talk about what you are doing on a computer interface in terms of what you familiar to in your daily life. - Enables a greater diversity of users to understand computer functionality. - Improve users’ confidence. Limitations of metaphors 4 - Designers sometimes have a misconception, they try to design an interface metaphor to look and behave like the physical entity it is compared with. - Breaks conventional and cultural rules - Constraints designers in the way they conceptualize the problem space. - Conflict with design principles - Not being able to understand the system functionality beyond the metaphor. - Designers can base their designs on existing objects that were badly designed. - The imagination of designers to come up with new conceptual models is limited. Question 3 (Chapter 5) 3.1. Discuss how the design of a technology can change the attitude and behaviour of people (10 marks). (Allocate 3 marks for explaining how technology can change attitude and behaviour of people. and 7 marks for discussion each of the strategies that can be used for designing persuasive technologies.) - Interactive computing systems deliberately designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviours in a predetermined way. For example, to persuade people to join good cause, give up bad habits, donate money... etc. - The study of computers as a persuasive technology is known as Captology. - The definition put emphasis on the intentionality of persuasion, which is aim the designer of the software. - Successful application of persuasive technologies has been reported in marketing, health, safety and environment. Students are required to provide examples of persuasive technologies that are popular in each of the given categories. - Strategies that are employed in designing technologies in order to change people’s attitude and behaviour include: (Note; students may describe each of the following strategies in their own words or by the use of examples) o Just in time persuasion o Simulating experience o Personalizing o Recommendation o Monitoring and tracking o Competition and recognition o Visualizing the personalities in virtual communities - Persuasive technologies have some disadvantages, especially deception.. 3.2. In interaction software design, what are the disadvantages of anthropomorphism? (10 marks). (Allocate 2 marks per disadvantage for any five disadvantages listed by the students. Note that students may provide some disadvantages that are not on the list) Disadvantages 4 - Deceptive, make people feel anxious, inferior or stupid - People tend not to like screen characters that wave their fingers at the user & say: Now Chris, that’s not right. You can do better than that. Try again.” - Many prefer the more impersonal: “Incorrect. Try again.” - Studies have shown that personalized feedback is considered to be less honest and makes users feel less responsible for their actions (e.g. Quintanar, 1982) - Lack the ability to follow a conversation and fail to suggest appropriate help. - Speech recognition systems incorrectly may translate people say. - If the technology is targeted for novice users, experts may become frustrated. - Giving users no control over the system frustrates users. - The systems deceive users because they think that computers have all human capabilities, hence they blame them when something goes wrong. - Agents cannot give some common examples that are not related to the current problem Question 4 (Chapter 7) 4.1. What are the four key issues that determine the success of a data gathering exercise according to the prescribed book? (10 marks). ( choose any four). (Allocate 21/2 marks per issue) Five key issues that require attention for data gathering are: - Goal setting o Decide which data to collect, data collection techniques and the analysis to be carried - Identifying participants o The population o The sample o Sampling criteria - The relationship between data collector and the data provider o Issues of ethics o Professional o Informed consent - Triangulation o Investigating a phenomena from at least two different perspectives o Types of triangulation: data, investigator, theories and methods - Pilot studies o trial run of the main study 4.2. Discuss what should be avoided when designing interview questions (10 marks). (Allocate 1 mark per point. Students are expected to discuss each of the ponts points) - An interview is a conversation with the purpose of capturing data. The following should be avoided when designing interview questions: o The questions should not be ambiguous o Avoid emotional language o Jargon or complex language should be avoided o Avoid leading questions o Avoid bias 4 o Ask question one at a time o Avoid questions that require a response of a simple yes or no answer. o Do not expect interview questions to directly answer your research aim. o Interview questions should follow some order. Do not ask abrupt questions o Avoid questions that are not related to interview goals. o The type of data recording should not interfere with the interview proceeding. Question 5 (Chapter 9) 5.1. What is the importance of involving users during the design of a computer information system? (10 marks). (Allocate 2 marks per point for any five identified by a students. Note that some students sub divided each of these points into several points. Marks should be allocated appropriately in that case) - Improved quality of the system arising from a more accurate capture of user requirements, this is because they use the system every day or on daily basis. - To avoid incorporation of costly system features that users would not want to use or cannot use. - To provide users with a system that meets their real expectations. - To ensure that users do not encounter surprises when the new system is delivered. - Greater understanding of the system by the users results in more effective use. Users can see from early stages of software development what the capabilities of the system are. - If users are involved, they will have chance to work with the product before it is released and they will have a better understanding of what to expect on the new system. - Increased participation in decision making within software development cycle increases ownership of the system by the users. Users who were involved feel that they have contributed to a product’s development are more likely to feel a sense of ownership. 5.2. Briefly discuss how you would involve users during the design of a computer information system (10 marks). (Allocate 1 mark per point. Students are expected to discuss how they would involve users based on each of the following characteristics of users). • Member of the design team – Full time: constant input, but lose touch with users – Part time: patchy input, and very stressful – Short term: inconsistent across project life – Long term: consistent, but lose touch with users • Newsletters and other dissemination devices • Reach wider selection of users • Need communication both ways • User involvement after product is released • Combination of these approaches © Unisa 2016","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":""}
